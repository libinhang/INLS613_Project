When you purchase a digital item from Amazon, they should give you explicit instructions in the process of downloading it. If you're having trouble figuring out how to download your Microsoft 365:
1. Go to Accounts
2. Click on Customer Service
3. Go to Messages (at the time, I had to scroll to the bottom and click on ""Get help with something else"", which led me to Memberships & Subscriptions and then Communications - see the problem?)
4. Find the message that begins with ""Activate"" and follow the simple directions

10,Software,Microsoft Office Home & Student 2021 | One-time purchase for 1 PC or Mac| Download,$124.99,4,"PROS: -Improvements over some of the features of my Office 2013. Some features in the 2013 version that had become unsupported like the popup synonyms and dictionary work on the new version. The interface is improved over 2013. Although my first choice was to continue to use 2013, at least 2022 was available for me to buy, and I didn't have to rent Office 365.

CONS:-I would have stayed with Office 2013 but Microsoft is determined to improve their revenue flow by forcing folks to either rent Office 365 or purchase an update to a newer version of Office.

I like Microsoft Office Home and Student 2022 just fine. It works quite well on my new computer, and the learning curve from Office 2013 was not steep. However....

Beginning of a mindless RANT:

I've been using Microsoft products for at least 40 years, and I've spent thousands of dollars on their software. I appreciate that Windows Home 11 is pretty much free now, and I'm pleased that I no longer have to pay $500 for their word processor. That said, I was very disappointed when I reached the end of the road on my old computer at Windows 10 because the computer wouldn't run Windows 11. I gave in and upgraded to new machines to go to Windows 11. That was my choice. I don't dislike Windows 11, and so far it works well for me, but when I tried to install Office 2013, I was not able to ""ACTIVATE"" it through my Microsoft account. I went farther back to my disk for Office 2007. Again, installation was not allowed. Instead, I was encouraged to rent software access for an online connection to Office 365 (A limited ""free"" version of Office 365 is available for strictly online use in order to compete with Google DOCS, but I would be out of luck if the internet goes down). I chose to purchase Office for Home and Student 2022 from Amazon instead.

I don't change software or hardware often. For example, we still use Quicken 2013 primarily because we don't like the ""improvements"" in the later versions that increase the price while removing features that we actually found useful, and of course, Intuit really wants you to rent Quicken. Office 2013 lasted me for 9 years on my old machine. If I had been paying $90/year rent for the software, then I would have spent more than $800. That's more than 3 times what I paid to buy it. If I wanted to do online software, I could have used Google DOCs for free or the free version of Office 365 online.

The last straw for me in this rent software business model is that HP now requires an activation to set up their printer software. I have a friend who got a new laptop. She asked me to setup her printer on the new machine. Easy, I thought, even though I worried over, IMHO, HP's sparse instructions, kludgy software, and an annoying and implacable website. I installed the print drivers despite the bad instructions and user interface. Then I was taken to an activation page. Activation Page! I tried to sign into her account from when she bought the printer for her old computer, but of course she didn't remember the password she used. I tried to set up a new account for her but that was impossible because her email address was already in use. Now I will have to completely uninstall the print drivers, request a password reset and start all over again. And HP wants her to join their ink-of-the-month club by guessing how much ink she might use. A printer is a physical device. No one is going to make a copy of a printer and give it to their friends to use on an unauthorized machine. That is one of many reasons that I no longer buy HP printers after years of using nothing else. For my personal use, I switched to Brother, which is not as fast as an HP, but it orders its own ink from Amazon WHEN IT NEEDS IT.

Now ACTIVATION is being used by software companies to force you to discard your favorite old software and buy or rent their new versions. I understand that software companies reach a point where they no longer want to support older software, but I prefer to upgrade on my schedule, not theirs. And I do upgrade when I'm sure that the features I like will continue, that the new features make the upgrade worth the price, and that I won't be held hostage to a new file structure or business model.

Therefore, it is my intention to NOT participate in rented software if I can avoid it. I never liked working on main frame computers using terminals and having to deal with centralized control. ""Personal computers"" were part of the revolution for me because they were personal. They stood alone for better or worse. They were not at the whim of some faceless tech. The current trend to re-centralize computing operations may appeal to many people, but I shall resist it so long as I can get away with it.

As a final aside, IMHO, the worst perpetrators in this new rental model are the Tax Preparation Software companies that do not clearly document what schedules are included in their entry/base rental price OR their entry/base purchase software. Only after you get started, do you discover that you have to pay a lot extra to get the one schedule that was not included. Imagine seeing that Schedule C is included but later you discover that it is only for Schedule C to enter income, you have to pay more if you want a Schedule C to include expenses. Oh, you can enter the expenses by hand, but then the company will not file your tax return that was part of your purchase price: you have to print the return and mail it in. Fortunately, I knew better than to buy anything so woefully described. Unfortunately, I had to buy a version of the software that included many more features than I needed just to be able to get Schedule C expenses AND free electronic filing. However, that was much cheaper than buying the next version down and then having to pay a large added fee to get the missing expense page. IMHO, the IRS is squeezing everyone into the online filing mode, and the software companies are coming up with all kinds of schemes to drive up the fees they can extract from their users. Don't get me wrong, I love online filing, but the misleading ads by the software companies providing these services is open to more abuse than selling timeshares. If you are selling TAX software, then the ads should clearly state which Schedules your software will provide and note any limitations.

End of mindless RANT.

Thank you Microsoft for allowing me to buy Office for Home and Office 2022. I would have been looking for a different software brand rather than signup to rent Office 365.",positive
11,Software,Microsoft Office Home & Student 2021 | One-time purchase for 1 PC or Mac| Download,$124.99,4,"I installed the 2021 Home & Student software with no problems.

I went to the ""Office"" icon and clicked. I was instructed to sign on to the Microsoft website and when I tried to access Office, I was rejected. Since there are no options to get a refund my blood pressure soared.

Then I went to the start menu on my laptop PC and found that Word, Excel and Powerpoint (also OneNote which I despise as it is online with no privacy) are listed in the start menu separate from the Office icon. I clicked on the three useful icons and the apps worked.

The reason this product does not get five stars is that, as far as I can tell, there is no way to have auto save working unless you agree to have storage on the web (as well as on the PC?). I don't need my files sitting on the web to be hacked some day.",positive

Anyway, checked out the reviews as I normally do... 4.4 stars out of 5. There was a fair amount of 1 star ratings with things about no download key after purchase, no way to cancel, security questions on validating the user hard to activate, etc. It made me a bit wary, but I went ahead and bought it for use for me and my family. So far, the best I can figure is there's a lot of confusion on getting this going... but I'm not sure why.

After purchase, I was able to get to the subscription through the Memberships & Subscriptions link under my Amazon Account at the top right of the Amazon page. I also got the email a few minutes later it said it would send after purchase. The email was the simplest solution as you read the instructions in the email and click the Activate button. Afterwards you're taken to a Microsoft page to link up your Microsoft account (or create one if you don't have one) with the subscription. Once that was complete, it took me to Microsoft 365 site to manage the subscription. I downloaded it for myself on my laptop, then sent out share invites in email through their Share option right on the main page. At least for me, this was fairly straightforward and simple.

I think the key to understand is Amazon sells you the license (just like any other seller) and then you manage the subscription on Microsoft 365 to setup the software for you and share to others in your family. It looks like Amazon does have a bit of automation for the auto-renewal, but you can turn that off in your Memberships & Subscriptions section for the purchase so you can look for better deals if you want... or keep it on and let it renew, it's up to you. From a bit of reading, it looks like you can extend your Microsoft 365 subscription up to 5 years out... so you can look for deals and just add on whenever you like (e.g. you find a deal for $75 for 12 months and you have 6 months left on your current subscription, you end up with 18 months until your next renewal on activation).

No flames to anyone who had problems, I've had my share with plenty of stuff in the past... but this was a good deal for me and was easy to setup. Hope it helps someone in the future. :)",positive

It even automatically removes old versions of their product. They do send the code to your email as well but you can just go straight to your digital purchases section to save time. Coverage this easy to install for a couple computers and your smartphone for a year and under $25? Perfect.

Update 2019: I just purchased it again a year later at $26.99 instead of the $50+ everywhere else and again within just a few minutes it removed the older version, did a fresh install and it even carried over the few days from my last time towards the new amount of days protected. Coverage for 3 devices just doesn't get more affordable or easier than this.

Update 2020: I had 20 days left so I bought this again and it worked like a charm for the 3rd year in a row. Buy it, go to your digital purchase section, copy and paste the key. They even have a link that opens up the site where you enter the key. It took all of a couple minutes and added 365 days to my subscription. I also want to add that running this and a decent adblocker meant no problems at all in the last year so this actually works.

Update 2021: With about 5 weeks left on my subscription I noticed the price dropped from $27.99 down to $19.99 for this and bought the digital download code again. It was instantly delivered to my email and appeared in my ""Games and Software Library"". In under a minute my subscription was extended for another year plus I didn't lose the days I had left on my current paid subscription from last year either. I'll keep updating every year with positive reviews as long as they make this hassle free and an honest transaction. If it ever changes, I'll also post a bad review but so far it's all positive 4 years in a row.

Update 2022: With 45 days left I bought another code, found it in my digital downloads then extended to 410 days within a couple of minutes. This kept 2 computers and a phone safe for another year. By using no rush shipping on other items I earned $10 in digital credits and when the price went to $19.99 it was just $9.99 by using the credits. Reliable and affordable for the 5th year in a row.

I've found Norton to work the smoothest. The Password Manager is a great plus. I'm not a fan of their VPN so I use Proton which I find to work much faster and it has a kill switch which can come in very handy. I would recommend you not purchase a new code for Norton until about a week before your current subscription expires so the code doesn't expire. Although it does appear that Norton won't start a new subscription code until the prior one actually expires. Then just go into your Norton account on the website under subscriptions and cancel auto renewal. I've never had a virus nor any other issues with Norton.

Within 10 minutes of paying for this I had it installed/updated on my main computer AND my laptop. It's not difficult & very easy to opt out of auto-renewal. Follow these steps:

Once you pay go to your Amazon Orders, click on your order and click ""View Your Item""
>> It will show you a screen with your new product key (copy if you want). Click ""Redeem""
>> This takes you to the Norton website where you need to login. You will have to enter payment info but don't worry, you can delete this... I entered a credit card so if Norton plays any stupid games I can process a charge back.
>> As soon as your account is activated, while you're still on the website, hover your mouse over your account name and click ""Manage My Subscriptions.""
>> You'll have to click that you want to cancel several times. Just pay attention and read, it's very easy. Some buttons will be gray. Don't try to talk to anyone, you can do it all by yourself.
>> Once auto renewal is cancelled you can go into your account, billing info and delete the CC info you just put in.
>> You can click download from the website to download the latest version, which will install over your existing Norton. Only took a few min to install & update.

NOTE: I never needed my product key for anything.

>> Any subsequent downloads to other PC's can be handled right thru the website. Just go to the website & login on that machine and download the same way you just did and DONE.

One last thing I'll mention is that my desktop did not require a restart to finalize installation but my laptop did for whatever reason.

Enjoy your next year of antivirus subscription!

[Old: 2021]
I see a lot of people complaining about how they're having such a difficult time with Norton and as someone who has dealt with their nonsense in the past, I was pleased to find this work out so easily. My subscription expired as of yesterday and I needed to renew so I was determined to do it no matter what.

Anyone who can rub two braincells together knows that Norton's automatic subscription renewal (through your Norton account) costs like 5x more than what you originally paid. Not sure why Norton likes to play these stupid games but it must count for something if they continue to do it year after year.

It's always cheaper to buy a fresh new version than renew like that. Btw, it's still cheaper here on Amazon than renewing with a discount on Norton's own website, which they will offer you if you have auto-renewal turned off... and you should do so immediately after installing.

No, you do not have to chat with an agent to cancel. Someone else posted that they did but they must not have read much before proceeding. Look for the grey buttons. Follow the prompts and cancel your auto renewal, you'll be promted a few times.

You do have to enter billing info in the beginning, which my PayPal info was saved from last year. If you really don't trust Norton, then once your sub is active just remove your billing info, which I went ahead and did as a precaution even though I know for a fact they didn't abuse it.

I have Norton installed across all my devices, this one in particular being a Windows 10 machine. So yes, it does work just fine on Windows 10. Once purchased I simply went to my Amazon software library where the digital orders was, clicked the yellow ""Redeem"" button & reinstalled it with the prompts and everthing happened automatically.

At first it didn't make sense that it needed to download again. However, it took less than a minute and after all was said and done, the new subscription info updated within the program itself on my computer, which I had open literally the entire time. Didn't even have to copy and paste any key codes.

Try not to overcomplicate things and you'll be just fine!!!",positive

69,Software,"Norton 360 Deluxe 2022 Antivirus software for 5 Devices with Auto Renewal - Includes VPN, PC Cloud Backup & Dark Web Monitoring [Download]",$24.99,5,"Hello everyone, I just felt the need to put my review out there immediately given all the bad reviews. So I have been using Norton for years. I always turn off the auto renewal option after I enter a new key code from a new purchase such as this one. So given all the previous comment, I decided to call Norton ahead of time prior to purchasing this product for another year. Call went very smoothly, they confirmed that the cancel auto renew option was still there however it will not show if you have already set up non renew from the previous year.

Until you actually enter the new product key and go through the minor install process to renew, the cancel auto renewal option will not show up. So I had 4 days to renew. I just purchased this product, amazon instantly sends you a link to click and follow the instructions. Or you can do as I did, logged in ahead of time, went to my covered pc and clicked to enter new product key. As soon as I did that, the renewal installation process began. Same as if you woud've clicked the link. Either way. Once I was done and all set up, I noticed that the ""My Subscription"" button all of a sudden showed up giving me the instant option to cancel auto renewal.

So in the end, everything worked well, everything was OK and it went pretty smoothly overall. As of now, when you try to cancel the renewal, a pop comes up asking to stay and not cancel and in return it offers you 30 additional days of coverage after 5 days. I have no problem waiting 5 days to set up non renewal after the fact for the additional 30 days. I think their hope is that you forget all about it. I assure I won't, however if you are the type that might, then forget the extra free 30 days and set up non renewal right away.

Hopes this helps to clear everything up and calms everyone down with the freaking out reviews. Trust me, I would be the first to go nuts on Norton if I couldn't do this. I would go to another protection provider, but I like Norton and everything went well.

Finally I want to let everyone know that on the phone they told me that my additional 4 days I had to renew would stack up on top of the new year renewal, THIS IS NOT TRUE !! As soon as you enter the new product key or set up the renewal, the new year starts as of the day you renew and whatever days were left are lost. So my recommendation is to wait till the last day or 2 before the renewal expires. I also recommend to not make the purchase till your ready to renew right there and then to not risk some kind of 20 day expiration limit that someone talked about in another review. I just did everything all at once just now from purchasing it, to installing/ renewing, to this review. Everything worked well !!!",positive

First of all, I purchased it with a printer, then ended up returning the printer… and there is no way to get a refund for this code or to return it. So I’m out $5 and I get nothing in return.

Next, if I HAD kept the printer, I found out that I wouldn’t even need this $5 code to use the Instant Ink program, because I’m definitely a light printer and would have only needed to sign up for the option where you can print up to 15 pages per month… which is TOTALLY FREE OF CHARGE. So I wouldn’t have needed this $5 code anyway! Useless.

Next, if I HAD kept the printer, and HAD needed to print more pages per month, I could have signed up for Instant Ink on my own, and only paid as needed for their services. This code saved me a few cents (it’s a $5 code and I paid $4.89, so I saved 11 cents off the $5 if I would have even needed it). That 11 cents of savings certainly wouldn’t be worth the effort of finding the code number and trying to get credit for that $5 on my Instant Ink account, when I could have just set up the account with my payment information and paid for it as I go. So this code only complicates the process and saves you almost nothing.

This is essentially a scam. The reason they offer this $5 code is to get people to sign up for Instant Ink, not to save you money on it and not to make it easier for you to sign up. It’s just a way that HP can ensure they get you to sign up for their ink system when you buy a new printer. But the real scam here is that you can buy a new printer and return it, but if you buy this code with it, you can’t get your money back for the code. So the real money maker here for this company is taking advantage of people like me, that bought a printer, ended up returning it, and never got to use their $5 code… or people who bought their printer, signed up for Instant Ink, and realized that the light printing option is free and that they will never need the $5 code. In both of those cases, this is a way for HP to get $5 from people in a non-refundable way, knowing very well that many people will buy this product and soon find out that they don’t need it. What a complete rip off. I am returning my HP printer for other reasons (realized I bought a model that isn’t the right set up for me), but when I do choose another printer I’ll be staying away from HP because this product is a total scam, and if HP is ok with intentionally cheating people out of money then I want nothing to do with them.",negative

It has been one of the leading brands of software for generations. But when you look at the jumps they have made with their operating systems, some of them have worked great like Windows XP, where others have not had as much of a run like Windows Vista, ME, and Windows 8. When you look at the latest incarnation, Windows 111, it feels more like a downgrade to Windows 10, which made it easier for you to scroll and find what things you need for upgrading or fixing your computer if the hard drive crashed. Personally, it does make it easier for wait times while I load my computer, but it could've had a little more in the end. Still, if I had to choose a OS between Chrome for Google, Ios for Apple or Windows from Microsoft, Windows would be a clear winner, only because it still is the most universal way to go for all your office needs.

Pros:
*Office Suite has more features and functions for power users than “free” software options like OpenOffice.
*Value! This is a great value given that this comes with six user accounts and 1TB of storage for each account. Seriously. It’s an unbelievable value.
*Microsoft has done a great job of weaving document sharing into a fairly seamless experience, once you realize how it’s set up (see the cons for that caveat).
*If you work in business, odds are you’re already going to be familiar with the Office Suite layout and a number of handy functions in tools like Excel and Word. It’s not hard to see how those tools are just as handy at home.
*Use it as training. Along with the above Pro, if you’re in college and intend to work in a business, I can’t emphasize enough how worthwhile this expense is. Start using it for your term papers, your notes, etc. I promise this will likely be just as valuable as any of the classes you’re spending thousands of dollars on. When you enter the working world, you will already have a huge leg up on your peers. I struggle with every intern that comes through the door and I have to coach through even the very basics of how to use Office Suite. It’s PAINFUL and I WITHOUT A QUESTION hire candidates who know Office Suite over similar candidates who do not.
*OneNote is laid out very intuitively. I’m never more than a keyword search away from the info I need in life. What was the kids’ math teacher’s name again? What was the neighbor’s address? What was the name of that bourbon I really liked, the movie I wanted to see, or that restaurant I wanted to try? Store it all! Even a photo of the label! Enter the info with a full keyboard on your laptop, then access and update it from your phone. And all stored in a file on your laptop and instantly backed up to the cloud. Beautiful.
*Outlook is lovely to look at and to use, whether a program on your laptop, accessed from outlook.com, or from your mobile.
*Use your cloud calendar. Enter events from your phone, tablet, or laptop. Share them with your family members to stay organized.
*The cloud storage is fairly intuitive and unbelievably handy. With the OneDrive app, I can throw special photos of the kids immediately into the appropriate folder in my Docments folder on my PC. Just a few minutes ago, I took an excel spreadsheet that a family member emailed me with all of our extended family’s contact info and (again through OneDrive) put it the folder on my PC with my other contact info spreadsheet. Took 5 seconds to do and now I won’t forget to check my email at home and download it and it will be right on my PC or phone when I need to pull someone’s number that I don’t use often enough to have in my phone contacts. I honestly can’t believe I’ve gone this long with this many devices and not had an intuitive solution to file sharing and access. Again, though, see the cons about lack of training and sharing. How could I have known?

Cons:
*Lack of training!!
*Given how powerful this and valuable this package bundle is, Microsoft doesn’t do a very good job of laying out how this could be used. Functionality is shared by multiple apps and applications in the system so it’s not always intuitive how they are interconnected by the cloud. Microsoft could and should be doing a MUCH better job of showing us how we could be using this system to organize our life. Use little “Did You Know?” video clips and have them woven into the experience.
*Sharing is still a little mysterious to me. How do I organize files shared with me so I can find them? Is there versioning if someone makes changes to a shared file? Again, poor training.
*I don’t have a warm fuzzy about data privacy with Microsoft. I don’t like Apple and how they force you to use their system or sacrifice functionality. But I DO trust Apple with my data. I have a hunch Microsoft is better than—say—Google as far as collecting your data, but I would like more reassurance that they guard our data for us. This is huge for me and maybe it’s not technically a Con, but it’s not a Pro, which limits what I’m willing to use this system for.
*Manual photo backup is easy, but manual large-scale photo backup fo the cloud is clunky and I haven’t figured it out. Again, see my gripe about lack of training.

Summary:
All in all, I’m a big fan of the Office 365 system and I intend to keep using it to organize my busy, chaotic life. But I had to take a star off because it feels like I either have to stumble along until I figure things out or I have to work too hard to learn how to use all this. I almost took off two stars, but as a whole feature set, it’s just so damn handy I can’t stay mad!",positive

First, I see two reviews that said that it did not extend their current subscription with Microsoft but instead created a new separate subscription (which would be terrible). For me, it did extend my current subscription. I logged into Microsoft, went to the ""redeem.microsoft.com"" address, made sure my login still showed on that page, and then entered the code. The bad thing about this situation is that not knowng what will happen would make anyone reluctant to buy this subscription on Amazon regardless of price. At the $99.99 price, I would definitely not buy this on Amazon.

Second, I see that the price has returned to $99.99. The interesting thing to me (and it's why I thought that the $59.99 price might have been ""permanent"") is that the renewal disclaimer just below the purchase price said yesterday that the renewal next year would be at the $59.99 price and that's what it says still on my subscription page.
=========================================================

Original ""review""
Note that this is not a review of MS Office 365 but an FYI on this Amazon item and how it seems to work. I was already a subscriber to Microsoft 365 Family and was being charged $99.99 per year by Microsoft. So, when I saw this today for $59.99 on Amazon, it was an easy decision to buy.

It appears from everything I can see, that you are actually dealing with two different subscriptions; one with Amazon and one with Microsoft. I am NOT saying that you will have two separate subscriptions for Microsoft Office and there is an easy way to fix this when you want to.

In my case, my renewal date for MS Office is November 18 with Microsoft. Buying this item on Amazon on June 25, I entered the code from Amazon on the Microsoft ""redeem.microsoft.com"" site and it extended the subscription for one year to November 18 of next year. However, on June 25 of next year I will be charged by Amazon at the same $59.99 rate. Simply put, if I do nothing, there is now a 5 month offset in these two subscriptions.

For me, I'm going to keep watching this listing and if it looks like this is a ""permanent"" price, i will likely cancel my Amazon subscription and buy it again next November so that the timing matches. Either way, if you use Microsoft Office 365 or intend to, this is a great price compared to buying directly from Microsoft.

There is nothing intentionally decptive in this listing, but it is a little confusing as you are buying an Amazon subscription that you redeem with Microsoft via code for a subscription for Office.

If you are a new subscriber for MS Office 365, none of these caveats apply; at $59.99 its a great deal.",positive

A back and forth with Customer service representatives at Amazon did not help very much. I finally got lucky, and tinkered - other forums were a bit more useful.

Each product has a single license key - it will be delivered to your Amazon subscriptions. That's fine.

BUT BEYOND THAT, it is still managed by Microsoft. You are using Amazon as a 3rd party authorized manager.

What does this mean?

You buy the product.
A single license key is sent to you.
That license key will be added to your Amazon games / software.
You activate that license key, and associate it with a Microsoft Account. This Microsoft should be for whoever you want as the administrator for your family.
The 6 licenses (yours plus 5 more) are assigned using Microsoft's system (you add people, and invite them with their phone number or Email address).

Why is this important? Because Amazon's systems are not going to have a 6-person license key. They have one license key, for one account, that up to 5 more people can associate with. Amazon does not manage the six people - Microsoft does. And this is the important part - I flipped out not understanding this. Hopefully, you will understand this before getting flustered.

Now, Amazon's hands are washed and cleaned from this point on...until next year, when you come up for renewal again. Then, Amazon assesses you the annual fee ($100 for Home) for Microsoft's continued access. the answer? Simply turn off auto renew, some time before 11 months are out.

Why buy through Amazon, if this is the same thing you can get through Microsoft?
The answer: Amazon occasionally will have specials of ""Put $300 in your cart for a $50 gift card"" or ""Microsoft Office + gift card for the price of Microsoft Office"". And yes, Amazon does run these specials at odd intervals, it is a good idea to use Amazon's plans and offers. And, you get 5% back with the Amazon Store Card, bringing the price down that much more.",positive

I bought this through Amazon for the few dollars in savings off the standard $99 pricetag. Doing that, however, means your order is now stored in the Amazon Subscriptions folder. To ""Activate"" the subscription Amazon asks you to ""connect"" your Microsoft account.

I try to avoid connecting different companies as often as I can. (Regardless of how ""simpler"" it might make things, I avoid automatic 'sign-ins' using Facebook or Google accounts for privacy, security, and other reasons.) Instead, I simply copied down the Activation Key in the Amazon Subscriptions receipt folder and entered it manually into the window on the Microsoft website where I was re-activating my MS 365 subscription.

The 3 stars refers to the pricing and need for ""connecting"" accounts on Amazon's part. Microsoft 365 itself probably rates at least 4 stars. At this point, however, a heavier computer user really has no choice but to bite the bullet and get it. It's getting to be as much a distasteful necessity of life as having to get a Gmail account for day-to-day navigation in the digital world.",fair

I wanted to keep the same email as it's how you log onto your One Drive, and I bought the new license to share with family and they needed it now. Microsoft said they'd help me set up on a ""temporary"" email and when Best Buy released the original email they'd help me to transfer from temp to original email. Except they lied. When I returned to transfer to my original email they said we can't do that. And sent me to Amazon. Amazon said they cannot make that kind of change only Microsoft could They offered to contact Microsoft and help me. They stayed involved until the bitter end. Microsoft said oops, sorry, very sorry. But sorry did nothing for my new dilemma. I said they could at least help me move my data from the old One Drive to the new. They sent me a link! A link which states there is no automated way, this must be done manually. Expect to set aside several hours! The great and powerful Microsoft would not help, I don't believe they cannot help. Well I had to move my data because Microsoft kept sending emails about paying for the One Drive space or else. That my data would be frozen until I don't know. I wasn't taking any chances with what would happen to my data. This was all because Microsoft lied about using a ""temporary"" email. All I have now is to warn others about how unhelpful Microsoft can be. No surprise there. But you may not know that you cannot change the email account your license is tied to. However I really wanted to commend Amazon as they took the time to actually help me dispute having no blame.

That wasn’t quite the answer I was looking for, so I asked “If my PC dies and I buy a new one, can I transfer this digital perpetual license to a new PC?” The agent responded “Yes, you can.”

Canceling the Autorenewal: 100% easy with no hassle, the other people who said it was hard, or said that you are forced to talk to a representative are 100% wrong.
when you click cancel, a pop up shows up that says something like ""we want you to chat with a rep to make sure you are getting the best out of you product, if you don't want to then continue to the cancellation process""

only annoyance is with Norton is when your computer is idle, like when watching a movie, a pop up telling you about a scan might interfere with you movie watching, but you can easily turn those pop ups off, all you have to do is google it.

I finally got someone at Norton on the phone, he was able to download the software and take over my computer to install Norton. He went thru DOS to download his program to control my computer. Finally after about 20 minutes he found the problem that prevented the installation. I had set my system so that it would not generate pop ups for permission to change the setting on my computer, once he changed this setting he installed Norton. I have over 35 years as a professional in computer . I have never seen this problem and was extremely frustrated with the installation problem. I especially did not like giving control of my computer to a stranger, but I was left with no other choice. A few other things, I had to go to Norton's web site to down load the software but I first had to make an account and agree to automatic renewal and was forced to provide a credit card for the next renewal before I could even download and install the software I had already purchased. After my software was installed I canceled the automatic renewal. Funny thing, went I went to load it on my laptop I had no problems at all. The automatic renewal and credit card requirements are a scam. No one should be forced to provide a credit card for renewal even before they are able to download the software that they already paid for. I had been using MacAfee for years, but I got tired of all the annoying pop ups and and upgrading my software . Sure I could shut down the automatic software up grades but then I got reminders that it was off. Once Norton was installed on my desktop things seem to work fine. I an not sure if I will renew or not, but that will depend how well it works and it will not be automatic and I will not buy it from Norton when you can get it much cheaper elsewhere. I do like the interface, and what the programs offers besides the virus protection, and not one pop up all day except when I check my email it continues to say it is checking for spam even though I check the box to turn the pop up off.",fair

It does not allow you to control popup windows and does background functions without asking often resulting in making your computer run very slow or even freeze. You cannot make changes in the settings unless you go online and fill out a form to even find out how to make changes. It frequently displays popup windows that are force you to click to close else it will display on top of any window for a long period before closing. The settings icon with this product does not give you any options to stop notifications even though searches revealed that it should. What it does do is to display icons to upgrade.
Support was useless and you can only chat with a computer generated tech which asks you to select from lists to describe your issue, which in my case was to stop notifications, however none of the options were even remotely related, so I had to choose an unrelated option knowing that if I did and it could not help after describing what the real issue was, it would allow you to chat with a real tech and prior to that you have to describe what the issue was, which I did, but when the support person answered the first thing he asks me was to describe what the problem was. Wow, I told him to read what I had already described.
I spent about 2 hours chatting with him as there were long delays before he would reply to me and often had to repeat what was already described. All I wanted to do was to stop the annoying notifications and he wanted to take control of my computer which was a Big NO for me. It was difficult to get him to answer direct questions and often his directions did not make any sense such as he asked me to click on % on the bottom right of my screen, but there was no % and after describing my screen to him he said that the % was an up arrow! This kind of thing went on for many minutes and finally had to terminate the chat.

This was one of the worst product support interactions I have ever had and the Norton 360 program is a scam to get you to buy several add-ons at $29 to $39 each for a year subscription.

Norton used to be a great product, but I recommend that you stay away from it. It is junk.

This program is awful. Do not buy it.

Added: 04-23-2022
I emphasize what was said before and want to disclose other issues that you should be made aware.

Norton disables the close ""X"" on popup windows which will stay open for several seconds even though you click to close it.

It will perform updates and background operations without any notification to you and it will take full control over any other operation, including while you are online, example I often have had to wait several minutes when starting a program before Norton finishes when it should only take a few seconds and I have an abundance of memory and high powered game computer. I have missed several auction opportunities because Norton takes control and does a background download and/or scans files. It will not give you any opportunity to stop it or give any notice. Further, even if you try to cancel any Norton operation, if say you are wanting to bid on an auction or run a game, using the task Manager, it will not allow you to cancel the operation even if you are the administrator.

This is a monster program and highly recommend that you do not purchase it.",negative

""This will take some time"" is the mantra, and yes it takes a long time to load. On the plus side the computer operating under Win-10 does operate faster. However the download has a host of ""apps"" and presumes that you have or are loading this to a smart-phone. Yes, you can keep your main screen and the links to open programs still work but,.... When you press the Windows symbol (where the start button used to be) you get an alphabetical list of your programs (oops, I guess they are all ""apps"" now). There are a whole bunch that you probably never had before. Some can be ""uninstalled"" while others (part of the Microsoft revenue stream?) cannot be removed at all. My guess is that the majority of the installation process is loading all the ""apps"". Since I do not have, nor do I ever want, a smart phone most of this stuff is junk as far as I'm concerned. Finally, Win-10 in pushy: it wants you to do all your stuff in their cloud so those functions are easy to access. Getting to some of your old programs (sorry, ""Apps"") have to be searched out using the Windows button in the lower left hand corner of the screen. Finding your data files for backups (you do regular backups - right?) is a bit daunting.

Outlook, Excel, Word, et cetera do work in the Win-10 environment.

That being said, I can only rate this a four because it is really not intended for desktop use and there are multiple opportunities to ""accidentally"" screw things up by telling the system that you are on a phone or tablet. So far, I haven't goofed. I would have preferred that Microsoft issue a version for desktops and without all the ""apps"" that most desktop users will never access let along use.",positive

1. Buy the product
2. Wait for a confirmation email from AMAZON that your order has processed -- that email will also include your Activation Code and the McAfee website to get your product installed (or extend the expiration date, as in my case)
3. If you have ANY OTHER ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE installed (i.e. NOT McAfee), use your program-uninstaller to deactivate and remove it, then re-boot your PC, PRIOR TO STARTING the McAfee activation process. I suspect many of the negative reviews stem from people skipping this -- any legitimate anti-virus program will have built-in security to stop almost all other programs from just uninstalling it, so YOU have to do it (unless it is McAfee to begin with -- their website knows how to uninstall THEIR own software)
4. Let McAfee install, period. You're done and have basic anti-virus protection.
5. If you want to supplement your protection with an additional FREE program, I'd personally recommend the products from Advanced SystemCare. They have paid versions of all their products, but they also offer FREE versions of all of them as well. And these work alongside McAfee quite nicely, I've found. And no, I do not work for or benefit in any way from Advanced SystemCare for stating this -- just came across their products years ago and have used them ever since.
6. After and during the installation of McAfee, it will ask you to set up Auto-renew. The 'pro' is that this gets you FREE support in the unlikely event your PC does get a Virus -- McAfee will work with you to get it removed, at no additional cost to you. The 'con' is that this sets you up for a RIDICULOUS renewal charge ($40 this year) when your subscription is 30 days away from expiration. If like me, you forget about this con and get charged, you can get a refund within 60 days, so it's not a huge deal. And you'll want free support if you DO get a virus -- happened to me about 6 years ago and was a nightmare, but professionals can diagnose and fix it pretty easily.
7. NEVER take a renewal-price from McAfee directly -- they're a company, and like all companies, they want to maximize profits. So they're betting on 'hooking' you with any easy auto-renewal, charging you an outrageous fee ($40 currently), and hoping you're too lazy to want to challenge any of it.

Pros: McAfee has a very good reputation. The first-year discount is very attractive. The Antivirus does a good job. The Firewall does a very good job of blocking suspicious incoming network connections. Web protection seems to do its intended job. Tracker removal is adequate. ID Protection is a very nice plus.

Cons: The renewal cost is a bit pricey. There is a noticeable slowdown when trying to open a web page that contains a large number of links when using the browser add-ons (WebAdvisor, Web Boost). The Interface is fairly good although it can be cumbersome when looking for a specific function (e.g., how to set the shredder level.)

Despite the immense hassle involved with changing systems I am absolutely going transition away from QuickBooks. This latest 2022 iteration is absolutely atrocious.

First, the customer service at QuickBooks is mind-bogglingly bad. One time with this new 2022 version I called with issues with logging in. They told me it was because my email address (associated with my company URL) was ""non-standard"" and I should use a ""normal"" one like Gmail or Hotmail. What?? Another time I called, he couldn't answer my questions, said no manager was available to help, and then asked to put me on hold for a half hour in essence to 'run out his shift'. He promised to call me back with a manager the next morning. I never got a call.

Next, the QuickBooks system is FULL of errors, and then when you try to hunt down help to fix them, the QuickBooks help is bafflingly bad. Every ten minutes or so I'd get a new error which I'd then have to google to find solutions for. Their help would not provide information on their own errors. Out of my two bank accounts, two PayPal accounts, and eight credit cards, nearly every single one had import or connection errors. I mention again that I've been using this software for over ten years. These aren't new accounts. For some I had to custom-write code to convert their files into something usable by QuickBooks. This should not be happening in 2022. When you look through the QuickBooks forums these issues have been thoroughly documented for YEARS by users and are still not fixed.

There are just so many issues with navigating through an account, reconciling accounts, and more, which are either tedious or user-hostile. I am baffled how this software is in this state.

And then of course there is the pricing issue. It was bad enough when they used to force you to upgrade every three years to have functional software. Now in 2022 they have a high price which you are required to pay YEARLY to use them. If the software and customer service were top-notch I might say it's worth that price. But with all the errors in the software and the atrocious customer service? There is no way it is worth this kind of money.

I will absolutely be changing off of QuickBooks. I will thoroughly document the process to make it easy for others to do the same. Managing finances is stressful enough - financial software should make this process EASIER, not HARDER.",negative

""Should of, Could of, Would of"".... I purchased the wrong software. I should have purchase the 2021 Desktop Pro 2021 instead of Desktop Pro Plus Subscription. By the way, Intuit will no longer support the 2021 Desktop Pro. They force you to purchase newest software.
One day, my Quickbooks software locked me out!!!! I had two choices. 1. Pay $350 for the annual subscription fee. 2. Purchase a new software with new license product ($250).
Either way, I had no choice in the matter. 20 plus years of data was locked up/held hostage like a scammer asking you to pay in order to gain access to your data.
I purchased the 2022 version. I had to contact Intuit's tech support in order to get the new software up and running. Unfortunately, I lost 2 months of data in which I had to rebuild it manually. Back up files were not being extracted correctly due to software issues. However, I did not lose the complete data.
If Quickbooks/Intuit wants to charge the customers to use their software on a annual basis, then they should be fair with the pricing. $350 VS $250!!!!! What a scam. You would think that they would provide a better pricing for the existing customers. Instead they will hold your data hostage until you pay them $$$.
Buyer beware. If you are considering on purchasing this software, beware of the annual fees.

Rather, I downloaded the latest installers for my Mac and for my Windows PC from Adobe's website and used the serial number from the disc to validate them. I had zero problems installing it this way. This way I was able to legally install it on both machines.

Once past the installation, I imagine that one's familiarity with Photoshop and Photoshop Elements may be the determining factor as to how much one enjoys using this amazingly rich software. I'm lucky in that I've used both programs quite a bit over the years so I find it familiar and easy. I've tried other programs such as the free GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) and experienced only frustration in not being able to complete my tasks, knowing it would be so much simpler (for me) in Photoshop Elements.

On the other hand, if a person is brand new to Photoshop Elements, I could see it being overwhelming as there are a ton of features. In that case I might think about taking a class or getting a good book on the software before attempting to learn its mysteries.",positive

The two most recent releases offer new features centered around adding one-click, or other easy access to apply effects. I infer that Adobe is targeting users who only want to improve snapshots of family and other casual uses, so Adobe no longer assumes any background in photography or photo editing. They have ""hidden"" some of the technical terms such as ""de-Gauss"" and color curve. They offer short-cuts and integrated tools that produce what I consider ""cute"" effects such as ""speed bluring"" meaning a blurred streak on one side of an object to imply that it's moving too fast for the camera to capture. However, I am glad that much more sophisticated features for photo editing are still there. For example, balacing the color tones and lighting when combing elements from different photos, compensating for perspective such as the fore-shortening caused by tiny phone camera lenses. I bet many users don't know that selfies using just your arm (rather than a longer distance between the camera and the subject) distorts the face so that the nose is more prominent and the face is more round.",positive

Amazon was supposed to have sent a confirmation email with a code needed to download the app. They sent a confirmation email, but the confirmation email contained no code.

McAfee then instructed me to enter a code from a card I purchased. Didn't get any card. No way to contact Amazon, since I can't ""return"" software that resides somewhere in the cloud and Amazon had invoked security alerts on my account. I could log on, buy anything I wanted, but security blocked me from tracking, reviewing, canceling, or returning my orders.

Amazon then sent me an email requesting a rating on my new McAfee software. In my mind, the rating was ZERO. SOMEBODY DROPPED THE BALL! I had been operating on a free trial of McAfee that came with the computer.

I already had a McAfee account, and the problem may have arisen, because a trial version of the program was on my new computer, the purpose of which was to encourage me to buy the full program at a slightly higher price than Amazon had charged me.

Also, since I had made some orders while visiting in another state using my old computer and bought a new computer after I returned, it generated all kinds of circular security alerts on Amazon due to the different locations and devices I had used. A real security nightmare.

Did you know you're expected to remember the month and year you first became a member of Amazon and your favorite charity at the time? I still haven't a clue. When you support more than one charity over the years, you don't necessarily have a favorite or remember which one you may have chose when asked by Amazon.

As a security question, they then asked me to list my thee latest purchases. We had bought some pantry items and sent some things to our grandchildren, but we could not remember the order of the orders. Since i had to get past the security alerts to access past orders, I ""failed ""the security test questions. I was getting frustrated with the security to say the least.

I finally talked to someone at Amazon customer service in person. They helped me access and install McAfee, and I changed my rating from 1 to 3. They automatically populated the correct code required by McAfee for me.

When things like this occur, it takes a lot of patience (which I was low on with the COVID thing going on), time and effort to fix. When I divide the value of the items by the time it took to resolve the security issues I had encountered, It amounted to less than half the minimum wage. I finally resolved the matter around 2:00 AM one morning after weeks of trying to fix it myself. The security alerts did not stop anyone with my password from logging into my account and making orders, only checking or canceling those orders. Not a very logical security program.

When you contact Amazon security (who work alone from home all over the globe), their mindset is that you want to create a new account or change your password, because you could not log on to your account. I had to interrupt fast-talking agents often to explain that I wanted to keep my account and that my password worked, so I WAS able to log on to my account. My password did not work when I wanted to review past orders. Amazon would send me to my email, and the destination from the email was a dead end.",fair

If you're having trouble finding it on your Amazon account go to Your Account here on Amazon, look for the box that says Digital Content and Devices and click ""Digital Games and software"". You'll see your Norton 360 there. Start the activation by clicking it.

One of the first things you'll see is a link to turn the auto-renewal off. If you do that you'll avoid a lot of the problems others have had with the other Norton 360 products with auto-renewal. If you have Norton account it will ask you to sign in, if you don't have a Norton account you can register one. Since I had one, I just signed in and it took me to Norton's website. It sent an email to me with the link to redeem the license. I clicked it and it took me to my Norton account where it showed the Norton 360 for 3 devices. There's a hard to see (at least for me) download button. You click that and it asks if you want to download it to the machine you're using. It also had the option to download it to another machine or device. I clicked download to the computer I'm using.

Now comes a strange problem. Downloading with my browser gave me a non-executable file called ""downloads"". I let my download manager download it instead and it was the Norton 360 exe file. No idea why the browser wasn't downloading an exe version. Once downloaded, it started installing and took maybe 2 minutes. From there, your choice on this, I ran the Live Update and it did update further, taking maybe 2-3 minutes.

That was it. Installed, no auto-renew and works just like my previous Norton software. I hope the above part is helpful for those that tend to complicate matters.

One thing I do see as a negative with Norton and it was the same way last year is the insistence on popping open a new tab in my browser to add all their extensions to my browser. There's probably somewhere to turn that off, but that part is still just a little annoying. It only does it ever so often (once a month or so).

I thought doing a reinstall would not be too difficult. Boy. was I wrong. While Norton does have a short video showing you how to transfer a license. It says nothing about how to reinstall. Never mentions the word.
I am sure this has happened to others. Let me make it easy for you. Use the device that you intend to reinstall Norton on. FIND the original purchase email. Just signing into your account won't work. Open the email. Sign in to your account. Delete the license for the machine you are using. Now, you can download directly to the one you are on.

I'm hoping it also fixed the no audio problem as well but I don't have a way to test that other than to set audio input hardware back to the Intel card and not ""no input"". The audio hardware is set back to the default input and it's working.

After going through one support person who deleted all my HEVC files after changing the programapps folder from TrustedInstaller to everyone"" and I don't know what else, repairing 5 programs that stopped working, even after a 2nd support person restored the HEVC codec from a website in South America, they finally had a tech person contact me by phone. I wouldn't let him make any more changes to my computer but he said I should check for pending updates to my system. I did this: Microsoft had 1 update pending (applied), Lenovo had a BIOS update pending (applied, rebooted) and INTEL had 4 updates, 2 of which were video driver updates (applied and rebooted).

Opened the project and the entire video stream was gone. Opened the media table and tried to drag and drop media to the timeline again and it wouldn't add. Had to start over.

I had 75 .mov clips to import to a project. All are taken with the same iPhone, no settings changed, all at 60 fps HD. The import brought in 69 clips then said the computer didn't have the correct HEVC driver to import the other 6 clips. I started a new project and imported just those six clips; no errors. Tried to import the other 69 and got the error that I don't have the HEVC driver. (It does)

I would drag and drop a title to the timeline (they have to be downloaded and you need to be signed into the software to use it. It's connected to your account at Adobe.) First time I was able to edit the text, then not again. I had to delete it and add it back to the timeline, then I could delete it multiple times. I added music to the timeline and the video disappears. I'm chasing bug after bug in this rag software.

All during editing and previewing the software will freeze or crash periodically. I have a new 2021 Lenovo IdeaPad laptop with the 11th Gen Intel processor i7-1165G7. So it's not an old computer; lots of power, lots of memory, lots of drive space.

Support pushes you to the Adobe community forum. Most of what's there (and on the Adobe FAQ) is support for older software, not really much help at all. Open a chat session and you're told that the Adobe Premiere people don't work weekends, check back on Monday.

This is a very simplistic tool for making videos. If you just need to make a slide show or MP4 video then this will fit the bill. I had been using Nero Platinum suite, which is a much better product. I should have just bought a newer version of that, but I thought Adobe video would be a much better product, since for the money it was just the one tool; it isn't.

If you're wanting to create DVDs or .iso files with multiple menus and sub-menus, this isn't the tool. The interface has a learning curve but it's not too difficult. You are very limited in things like modifying menus or creating an intro video. It does do animated menus but there are not a lot of package menus to choose from.

For support there is an active user forum. There are a few knowledgeable people who are quick to respond. I did not find the built in help function of Elements to be very helpful.

If you are a novice, this is a good tool for learning how to create videos. It even has the ability to create the video for you with just some simple inputs. If you already adept at making videos, movies, etc. then you need a more powerful tool or you'll be disappointed with Adobe Elements.

I also purchased Corel VideoStudio Pro 2020. Don't make that mistake. Their support was taking up to 2 weeks to reply to me and were unable to find a solution to a known issue dating back to at least 2018 that prevented me from making ANY kind of video until I moved the installation to another machine.",positive

I finished my taxes earlier this past week on Windows 8.1 and re-installed the program on Windows 10 21H2 and redid my taxes as the worksheets from trying different things were still pre-populated on Windows 8.1. By doing a clean install and only filling out the worksheets I actually needed I got a better more accurate return.

The earlier you start using TurboTax i.e. in Nov/Dec of the prior year the more forms will not be complete but the program should put you in the ballpark if you need to make another estimated tax payment or pay another mortgage payment before the calendar year is up. By the time Jan rolls around more updates make the program more usable. I think QC is lacking as the Jan 20 update shut me down completely and I had to wait for the Jan 27 update to have a working program again.

Lucky for me I run Windows in Virtual Machines so its really easy to backup/restore the entire Virtual machine from the command line in Linux using the tar command i.e. 30 minute top. This works great for the few times that a Windows 10 update has bricked my machine hence the reason for wanting to stay in Windows 8.1 for as long as I can but ultimately it's going to be the Win 10/11 show and that's were those backups come in handy.

I changed my stars from 1 to 4 to 5

Updated Jan 31, 2022 Review
I checked daily for a solution to the problem mentioned in the original review and there were none. On January 27th, I tried the newest weekly update and surprise TurboTax is working again. What a scare. It used to be that the product was tested better but in this day and we all are also in the quality control business and problems can take longer to solve. Glad this one only caused me to be down for a week, it could have been worse. I am raising my review to 4 stars. If I get to file my taxes w/o issues I'll review the star rating later

Original Jan 24, 2022 Review (1 Star)
Usually I run into very few problems installing the software and using it. This year was going well until the January 20th update. TurboTax tech support states there is no solution to this problem. So I may not be able to use Turbo Tax to do my taxes this year since they are at a loss. What's next? Finger pointing: i.e. it's my hardware, it's Microsoft's fault, it's TurboTax's fault ...

Hopefully TurboTax is monitoring the reviews and lights a fire under the problem and gets it resolved",positive

The question/chat box pops up occasionally, asking if I need to speak to a specialist, so help is easily accessible. I haven’t had any accuracy issues at all.
TurboTax leads you through each catagory, and though it seems repetitive in the finishing, I appreciate that it slows me down. I’ve had to go back through to add info I’d forgotten, or edit or delete. I have to use forms for itemized deductions. I like being able to begin, and take 2 or 3 weeks to finish. I don’t have 8-10 hours straight to work on gathering data and fill out on my forms. Life doesn’t allow me that. I can save my input and come back later, in a couple hours or a few days, or weeks.
Once I’ve gathered my deductions data, it’s very easy to input. I’ve appreciated the upgrades since the earlier years. The only thing I dislike is paying my state’s $25 fee for E-filing. I do appreciate that the state forms are available as part of TurboTax. Following the same format & having my same info filled in is a time & headache saver. God bless the TurboTax folks!",positive

The one thing I do not recommend doing is installing their web browser extensions.

This is because the web browser makers are able to updated and patch their browser quicker than Internet security software makers can.

280,Software,"Norton 360 Platinum 2022 Antivirus software for 20 Devices with Auto Renewal - 3 Months FREE - Includes VPN, PC Cloud Backup & Dark Web Monitoring [Download]",$39.99,4,"So I am somewhat frugal (cheap) when it comes to certain services on the PC's and devices in my household. I have for years got buy on Avast, Avira, and even recently good ol' Microsoft Windows Defender. Defender or whatever it is branded now is actually not as bad as it was when it initially launched eons ago.

Recently, a friend who has used Norton protection for years told me about the 20 device Platinum package on a daily deal from Amazon. I know Norton has had its ups and downs too over the last decade but I believe in the last 3 or so years, it has actually gotten decent again. After doing some research and reading some reviews from PCMag and other Internet sources, and having yet another friend also say he has been using it forever, I took a chance and bought it.

Amazon sent me a product activation key and it was no big deal to sign up for a Norton.com account. From there I was able to login and register my key. Sure enough, it gave me 15 months of service so I am good till early April 2022.

From the online dashboard, downloading the client for PC was straightforward enough. There is a tiny downloader that they push to you and from there it downloads roughly a 250MB package that installs the client. It appears they do some ""magic"" because once installed, it was intelligent enough to activate itself and I did not need to log the Norton client into anything. It just activated and registered itself as one of my devices.

So I did this with 4 desktop PC's and 1 Dell laptop. All no issue. Now to be clear, from each PC I did have to log into norton.com to get the installer and after each successful activation, the norton.com portal did show a device registered.

I also installed the mobile version as well on the 4 Android phones in my household. The norton.com portal had a QR code that my old Samsung Galaxy S9 recognized by just pointing at with the camera. It sent to a link in the google Play store, installed itself and it also seemed to register itself without issue. Setting this up was a little more tedious as the mobile client walks you through finding the Norton 360 service and basically giving it free run of your phone. Again, was not hard. Just took a little time. I did manage to set the VPN to auto so it appears if you are on an open non encrypted wifi the VPN client should kick in and encrypt your mobile data.

The remaining 3 android phones were a little more cumbersome. I did the camera trick with the QR code again on my daughter's Motorola G Power and it went to the app in the Chrome browser not Play store. So it wanted me to sign in with her Google account credentials and I did not understand why it did not work as smoothly as it did on my Galaxy S9. However, I did figure out I could just install the Norton 3760 mobile app directly from the Google Play Store app. When launched, it asks you to sign up and subscribe or just login in. Logging in with my existing newly created norton.com account was sufficient and the mobile app was sufficient to activate the phone. I did this for the remaining 2 phones. Just downloaded and signed into the Norton 360 mobile app. Didn't bother with QR code. Setting up the remaining 3 phones was the same. Just let the Norton 360 mobile app tell me to give permissions to the Norton 360 service on the phone, set them all to Auto VPN. Done.

So installation and set up was easy enough.

I used Live Update on the PC's and watche dit update virus definitions and patch the client.

I played some with the VPN. I have 1Gb Fios. The Norton 360 PC client has a place to turn on the VPN. Just a toggle On and it says the connection is secured. If I did a ""What is my IP"" in Google my IP address was definitely different than what my Verizon Fios IP was. Matter of fact doing a lookup the IP range I was on appears to fall into Amazon Web Services ranges. Also going to speedtest.net it said I was coming from Amazon. Speedtest.net had me connect to some west coast server. Speeds were around 300Mbps up and down. So seemed plenty quick.

I looked a little at the Firewall. I do have some holes punched in the Windows firewall on my PC's for various servers. Filezilla, Minecraft, Serviio come to mind. While I figured out how or so I think I have, to manually add custom rules to the Norton firewall, I have not had a chance to see if I can get my custom ports configured correctly and working. Not that I am an expert of any sort, but I was fairly competent at getting the proper holes punched in the Windows Firewall. Guess we will have to relearn Norton firewall.

My son absolutely refuses to let me install it on his desktop gaming PC and his laptop. HE is kind of paranoid that it will break his game servers and such too. He still runs standard Microsft Defender.

To be honest, I never really had an issue with virus infection. Granted I do not do anything overly risky online. I try to be diligent about phishing emails and things that just look sketchy. Still, I received an email spam once that had a partial password in it threatening me to pay bitcoin or else alleged pictures of me looking at unscrupulous material would be emailed out to friends and family. While I do not have a webcam pointed at me at any given time and I do not look at such materials anyway, I was more concerned about the spam having a partial password. The scrupulous individual claimed he used a keylogger. So my concern was did my freebie AV solutions not catch the keylogger? Which machine was compromised? What did I even do to get compromised? So I figured like I said before a paid solution may be better than a free one.

Just because I am paranoid does not mean that they are not out to get me.

Lastly, I am concerned about the renewal process. So you have to sign up for Auto Renewal. My referring friend advised me that come Holiday season 2021 I should be on the look out for another holiday deal for Norton. Whether it be an extension of the current product, a new product or what not. I guess renewal at Norton rates is in excess of $120. However, if I can get another holiday discount, I can sit on that key and say a week or two out, cancel auto renewal. Then when the current license expires, just enter the new key into my norton.com account. My friend advised me he has done this method for years. Only caveat he said is that if you enter a new license key into an existing subscription, it will destroy your existing license, forfeit any remaining time on that license and start the new one.

In this day and age with Google Calendar and Alexa to remind me about things months away, I am confident I will ""remember"" with help to stop auto renewal. You need to keep the auto renewal enabled so that Norton will honor their Antivirus promise. As it is now that I am actively subscribed and auto renewal enabled, I do not see any place to enter a key anyway now. I suspect this will change either when I shut auto renewal off and/or my current subscription expires.

Hopefully after having 15 months with the product I will have a better feel for its effectiveness and value. As of now I have 9 out of 20 devices activated.

Maybe I will update this review periodically as it has a chance to gestate on my devices.",positive

Every year I save a lot of money ($50 to $100) by waiting for sales on Amazon and purchasing the downloadable software package for 10 or 20 devices.

The only downside is you will have to re-install Norton on every computer and/or device. That can be a bit of a hassle, but it's well worth it to me to re-install, which takes about 10 minutes per device.",positive
