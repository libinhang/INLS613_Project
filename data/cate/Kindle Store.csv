0,Kindle Store,The Perfect Marriage: A Completely Gripping Psychological Suspense,$7.99,5,"“The Perfect Marriage” by Jeneva Rose was truly a brilliant read. Her style of writing is fantastic as the characters, story, plot, twists, turns, and everything else in between were all great. You truly get pulled in as a reader as this mystery novel pushes the envelope for telling an incredible story that involves murder, infidelity, and all the consequences that come with it.

From Sarah, Adam, the cops/lawyers involved, and all the events that transpired in law offices/courtrooms, this was such a wild ride. I truly had no idea how this would get all wrapped up since the tension was real as it kept me guessing until the very end. Don’t worry, I won’t ruin or spoil anything for you but I totally had no idea that this would have such a mind-blowing ending.

The ending completely and utterly blew me away and instantly made me a reader of Rose because it was that crazy! I plan to read her previous and future work as my goodness, this was such an awesome read from beginning to end. I also enjoyed how the ending filled all the gaps for me by answering all the questions I had about things as I read to know what really happened when everything was going down.

Overall, I give “The Perfect Marriage” by Jeneva Rose a perfect 5/5 as it checks all the boxes for me when it comes to a wonderful mystery novel that also falls into the thriller/suspense genre. This was quite the reading experience as I’d recommend this to anyone that also loves these genres. I’ll remember this one for many years to come!",positive
1,Kindle Store,The Perfect Marriage: A Completely Gripping Psychological Suspense,$7.99,4,"I chose 4 stars because I had it pinned from the start what happened (minus the last major event that took place) I like the element of surprise, and when the little twists and turns came about it made me second guess my initial decision. Overall, I think it was a good book and if you like the idea of thrillers and revenge then it’s a good option for you!!",positive

4,Kindle Store,The Perfect Marriage: A Completely Gripping Psychological Suspense,$7.99,5,"This book was a bit slow to start but just when I started to think it wasn't going anywhere something happens. It leads you on in directions that then make you think its someone else and goes back and forth. By middle of the book I was on the edge of my seat and couldn't put it down.

5,Kindle Store,The Perfect Marriage: A Completely Gripping Psychological Suspense,$7.99,4,"It's a quick and thrilling read. Sure there were parts that were too drawn out with unnecessary details, but that didn't take away from the story too much. Perhaps it wasn't all that realistic. It was just a little twisted. Not a brilliant read, but it was exciting and at times unpredictable. I was worried it would be predictable, because there were several cliche parts. I loved this book and didn't want to put it down and the ending was wonderfully disturbing. It's also a bit spicy.",positive

10,Kindle Store,Reminders of Him: A Novel,$5.99,5,"Absolute perfection!!

Five years ago, Kenna made a devastating mistake that led to the death of the man she loved. Now out of prison, she is returning to the town in which the tragedy occurred, hoping to start a relationship with her four-year-old daughter, Diem. But she knows it won't be easy and, in fact, it seems everyone in her daughter's life is determined to shut her out even though she is doing everything she can to prove herself and absolve of her sins.

Though unlikely, Kenna finds support in the form of Ledger Ward, a local bar owner and someone with a big connection to her daughter. Though he should hate her, and does at first, as he gets to know Kenna, Ledger sees beyond her mistakes to the kind, loving, smart, strong woman she is. A woman who has held her own share of unimaginable grief and loss and just wants the chance to know her daughter. And though it puts him in a terrible position, he cannot help but develop feelings for her.

Despite the impossible circumstances, Ledger and Kenna form a bond that defies logic and they know they will have insurmountable odds to beat if they are to be together and if Kenna is going to be allowed to be a mother to her daughter.

I am not sure what more I can say about this book aside from the fact that it was utterly beautiful. Harrowing, raw, emotional, it tugged at my heartstrings

It is no secret that I am rarely disappointed in anything Colleen Hoover writes. I find that she is a master of writing nuanced characters that have deeply complex relationship dynamics and often times, immense flaws that only had to their complexity. Reminders of Him was no different.

Told from the perspectives of both Kenna and Ledger, you follow each on intensely emotional journeys separately, as well as together.

For Kenna, it is a journey of redemption. Absolution. The journey of a mother who just wanted to see her daughter and who will do whatever she has to to make that happen. It is about proving her worth, atoning for her sins, and showing that she is not a bad person. She is just a person who made a really bad mistake.

For Ledger, his journey is one of forgiveness. Of doing what is right. Overcoming years of hatred to see beyond the loss he suffered to the heart of the person who caused it. Realizing that the love and relationship he has developed with Kenna's daughter is only one that can be enriched and benefitted by Kenna's presence, not harmed by it. But he is put in an awful position as being with Kenna, fighting for her, means betraying the people raising Diem. The ones most affected by Kenna's mistake.

Though this is a relatively brief novel, it packs a severe punch. One that his agonizing and heart-wrenching as you route for Kenna, but cannot help but be appalled by her past. As you are frustrated with Ledger, but also understand his actions and his reasonings. There is so much depth here and it was so well done.",positive
11,Kindle Store,Reminders of Him: A Novel,$5.99,5,"People have been raving about Colleen Hoover's books for several years, but I still hadn't read any. I finally picked up It Ends With Us and now Reminders of Him. She is definitely deserving of the praise and I will be picking through her backlist. In this book we meet Kenna Rowan, a young woman who made some awful mistakes and paid a terrible price. She has a four year old daughter that she has never seen, and is being raised by her paternal grandparents, as her father is dead. They do not want Kenna anywhere near Diem, but she just wants to see her, to meet her, not take her from her grandparents. When she returns to town, she meets Ledger, the best friend of Kenna's deceased boyfriend, a man who is very close to his family and an integral part of Diem's life. He is attracted to her, until he finds out who she is. When they begin to develop feelings toward one another, Ledger tries to resist, but he wants to do what is best for both Kenna and Diem.

This story was so emotional, I was glad I had tissues near by. We learn about Kenna's past and the accident that changed her life completely through letters she has written while in prison. She shares her feelings and thoughts that she couldn't tell anyone about. I wanted to reach into the book and hold Kenna close, stroke her hair and wipe her tears. She is a character that gets under your skin and breaks your heart over and over. Ledger was another amazing character. He wanted to do what was right for everyone, even if it caused those he cared about some pain. He looked beyond all he heard about Kenna and saw what was in her heart. The romance was slow to develop, but there were a couple of sex scenes that I could have done without. One thing I have come to learn quickly is that Colleen Hoover writes amazing characters who become real, people you want to know. The story itself is very well written, with well developed characters, an excellent plot and one that I wanted to know what was going to happen, but didn't want to end. I loved the epilogue as it tied up the story nicely, yet was short and sweet. I definitely recommend this book to people who enjoy romance, second chances, family stories, forgiveness and family.

I did a read/listen with this book and both formats were wonderful. Brittany Pressley and Ryan West do a fantastic job narrating this book. The emotions shine through with their performance and when I was listening I was totally immersed in the story. When I had a chance to sit, I read and again, was pulled into this story. I recommend either format.",positive
12,Kindle Store,Reminders of Him: A Novel,$5.99,5,"This is my second book by Colleen Hoover and I honestly didn't think anything could top the first, It Ends With Us. And while I'm not sure I would say this tops it, it's right there beside it. I haven't read a novel from cover-to-cover in a single day since I was a teenager... until this book.

Reminders of His is classified as romance, and while there is romance within it's pages, that's not the most prominent love story. And this love story completely, utterly gutted me. There were only a handful of pages I read without tears in my eyes.

If you've read anything by Colleen Hoover, you know she's a master with words, and this book was no different. Her writing is absorbing and mesmerizing, and she creates beautifully imperfect characters that you are immediately drawn to and feel like you know yourself. The story itself, however, is truly spectacular. It's raw and human and so real. There are no ""bad guys"" in this one--only people who have loved and lost and are doing the best they can to cope. Any person with feelings is going to have a lasting lump in their throat. And for the mothers out there, it's going to cause you physical pain.

One last note on the story. Colleen has done a exceptional job of humanizing a person we, as a society, love to demonize because of their record. I personally had family members who were in prison and can attest to the accuracy with which the author portrays the difficulties and challenges faced when inmates are released back to the streets. This struggles this main character faces just because of having been to prison are real. The story provides an urging to society to remember that people are human and make mistakes and many do not deserve to be demonized as a result; a mistake doesn't make someone a bad person.",positive
13,Kindle Store,Reminders of Him: A Novel,$5.99,5,"Wow! Just wow. I wasn’t sure how to write this review or where to start this review. This book was so much and its hard to put it all into words.

I finished this book in a day and a half. I just couldn’t put it down, I just had to know what was going to happen.

This is one of the saddest book I've read. Kenna's story just broke me heart. This book really made me cry.

Kenna made one mistake and it has impacted her whole life, and let be honest even before her mistake she didn’t have the best life.

She was finally able to have a moment of happiness and its ripped away from her in the harshest of ways possible.

I couldn’t believe how unfair her life has been and I just wanted her to get a win just one.

Ledger was a bit of a jerk in the beginning which was understandable given the situation.

But he was a caring and considerate to the people he cares about and extremely protective.

“I don’t like that the one person I dislike the most in this world reminds me of the person I love the most.”

After some time he realizes that maybe he didn’t know the whole story and he was led to believe something that wasn’t true. And maliciously but because that was what it seemed like.

Ledger starts to see a side of Kenna that he didn’t realize existed and he sees the sadness in her, even though he doesn’t want to he finds himself being protective of her.

Kenna does everything she can to try to redeem herself, but it seems like its always out of her reach.

Everyone judges her and doesn’t know a thing about what she's been through the hurt, the pain, the utter despair and the depression she felt. It just broke my heart.

“So, you decide right now, right here. Are you gonna live in your sadness or are you gonna die in it?”

Colleen Hoover really took me on a rollercoaster ride in this book. You feel the hurt of all the character and their pain.

“Please don’t,” I whisper. “It hurts enough already.”

What was really amazing too was while we were in the present in the story we got to understand the past and the relationship between Scotty and Kenna. And how much they felt for each other.

This was beautifully written I literally could put the book down all day I just had to know how things would end for Kenna, Ledger and the rest of the characters.

“Maybe it doesn’t matter whether something is a coincidence or a sign. Maybe the best way to cope with the loss of the people we love is to find them in as many places and things as we possibly can. And in the off chance that the people we lose are still somehow able to hear us, maybe we should never stop talking to them.”

It takes Kenna a really long time but she does find a way to forgive herself for the mistake she's made. And for her to find some sort of happiness. I enjoyed this part some much and was so happy for her.

“Now that I’ve forgiven myself, the reminders of him only make me smile.”

Ledger and Kenna are so good together, I love that Ms. Hoover took the time to let the characters really get to know each other and it wasn’t rushed. They peeled back every layer and got to the heart of everything. Which bound them together even more.

Colleen Hoover weaves a story of love, loss and forgiveness that will have you crying and wishing that you could give Kenna a hug. I wanted so much for things to go right for her for. And for someone to give her a chance.

This is an amazing story, that will bring all your emotions to the forefront and make you cry.",positive
14,Kindle Store,Reminders of Him: A Novel,$5.99,5,"4.5 stars

It is no secret that Colleen Hoover knows how to craft an emotionally intense story that could very well be the life story of any one of us. The myriad of people who have read her books and then posted somewhere on social media that they related so completely with a particular story is endless. I see posts, daily, about how these stories touch their lives. And Reminders of Him is no exception.

I am not saying that countless people can relate to the fact that this young woman spent years in prison because she made one life altering decision one night. I’m saying that countless young woman can relate to Kenna, as a person, as someone who grew up in the same kind of environment she was subjected to. Who felt mostly unseen their entire lives, like they weren’t important or worth anything, until they met a Scotty of their own.

Even though Scotty is gone, he played such an integral role in this story. He was still Kenna’s sounding board every single day. She basically had no one at all in the world, so it was no wonder she still clung to him all these years later as someone she loved, admired, and was devoted to. Even though Ledger’s initial feelings towards her were not positive, he quickly turned into that one physical person Kenna was able to turn to for the same comfort she always got from Scotty.

I’m not going to lie, a large majority of this book felt super heavy to me. Like there was never going to be a way that anything positive was going to happen. It just felt like an insurmountable, no-win situation. Until finally, some rays of sunlight started to peek through. I really have no clue at all how Kenna stayed on her feet every day. I feel like I would have crumbled long ago and never have found a way to rise out of those ashes.

This was a powerful read. It definitely tugs at all the heartstrings. Ledger was otherworldly. Are there really guys out there like him? I’m pretty sure there are, because I married one. I hope every woman out there finds her own Ledger.

My only complaint was that it wrapped up too quickly in the end. I wanted to see so much more interaction between Kenna, Diem and Ledger. But at the same time, Colleen ended it perfectly. Wow, just wow.",positive
15,Kindle Store,Reminders of Him: A Novel,$5.99,5,"This is my first Colleen Hoover book (I know I know I know). 10% in an I am already bawling, tears streaming down my face like I am Kenna and can feel everything she is going through, the self torture, the pain, the struggle, the fear. This book already has me by the eyeballs and I can’t put it down.

I can not with Kenna’s mother. All of the history that Kenna describes breaks my heart. As a parent how could you ever be like that with your child? A part of you?

Like Kenna and Ledger in this story I am so torn. I can feel every single thing, I found myself crying and not realizing I was crying. I found myself holding my breath, waiting on pins and needles, I found myself shaking my head and my heart filling with so much pain, empathy, and frustration for what they must be going through. Each of them.

This book deals with love, heartache, betrayal, grief in more ways than one, regret, and so much more. I could not put it down and by the end it left me way beyond spent. I can not wait to devour all of Colleen Hoover's Books. If you love a good tear jerker book, with heartache and romance then grab this asap.",positive
16,Kindle Store,Reminders of Him: A Novel,$5.99,4,"Spoiler alert. I don’t give away the plot or anything but you’ll be able to dismiss some theories about the outcome.

.

.

.

I did not like the main character at all. Seriously, a heroine who I would cast as the villain? Then I figured we would discover it wasn’t true, her evils didn’t happen as we thought. It was another guy, a case of mistaken identity, someone switched out the clues or whatever.

But no, the reader is forced to forgive someone for having done a terrible thing.

I couldn’t! I couldn’t get past the bad and like her enough to root for her. Until I did. Somewhere in there I saw the main character the way the author intended; a good person who made a series of mistakes because she was young and dumb and in love and thought she was invincible, of young and dumb and thought “things couldn’t be worse than this”. Like everyone else was once upon a time.

…which I’m guessing was the whole point. It’s not forgiveness if you find out the person didn’t actually do it, it’s forgiveness when you know they did, and you choose to stop holding it against them.

So in all, I liked it. A star removed because it was a bit too tidy, and I thought some characters could do with a half-page backstory to explain them. But others seem to think characters are all well developed, so that’s probably just me.",positive
17,Kindle Store,Reminders of Him: A Novel,$5.99,5,"I saw this book on my recommended reads, but I wasn't sure if I would like it. I read a few of the reviews and decided to give it a shot and I'm extremely glad I did. I felt Kenna's sadness and longing for hope through the letters she wrote to Scotty. I cried for her and her struggles to forgive herself for the tragic accident that took the life of the man she loved, blaming herself and feeling she deserved a much stronger punishment than seven years in prison, that she didn't even try to fight for herself. I felt anger at those that couldn't see past their own grief and pain to do more than place blame and condemnation towards Kenna. All until she was able to finally share some of the letters she wrote to Scotty with his best friend and he realized just how wrong they all had been about her. Make sure you have tissue close by as I'm sure you will need some. This book was well written to the point that I could picture things in my mind while reading this story. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.",positive
18,Kindle Store,Reminders of Him: A Novel,$5.99,5,"This is an incredible book. Its a love story of relationships, grief, and finding forgiveness and joy again. Colleen Hoover has written something you rarely see in books that life is messy. Rarely is their a clear-cut villain that would make real life easier to understand. Its a lovestory of motherhood and hope. I cried more reading this book than I have reading anything in years. You cry in pain and sadness and you cry in happiness and joy. You laugh because sometimes in grief the only you can do is laugh or give into the pain.

I really appreciated the spotlight on the bleakness of prison and the inhumanity it often holds. There's an exploration of how hard it is for some to go on after prison. The book is really about the layers to forgiveness and the many ways it makes into your life.

This is really very poetically written. Its worth all the tears to read, but have a tissue box or two ready when you do.",positive

💭”Whoever was the first person to say they fell in love must have already fallen out of it. Otherwise, they’d have called it something much better.”

After serving five years in prison for a tragic mistake, Kenna Rowan returns to the town where it all went wrong, hoping to reunite with her four-year-old daughter. But the bridges Kenna burned are proving impossible to rebuild. Everyone in her daughter’s life is determined to shut Kenna out, no matter how hard she works to prove herself. The only person who hasn’t closed the door on her completely is Ledger Ward, a local bar owner and one of the few remaining links to Kenna’s daughter. But if anyone were to discover how Ledger is slowly becoming an important part of Kenna’s life, both would risk losing the trust of everyone important to them. The two form a connection despite the pressure surrounding them, but as their romance grows, so does the risk. Kenna must find a way to absolve the mistakes of her past in order to build a future out of hope and healing.

I thought I was going to be in the minority because I wasn’t feeling it up until halfway through. It was way too slow 🐢 PLUS I had a hard time connecting with the overall story. I felt like it wasn’t your typical Colleen Hoover novel. At about halfway, I would’ve rated it only 3 stars.

21,Kindle Store,Rich Blood (Jason Rich Book 1),$4.99,5,"Robert Bailey does a good job of making what seems obvious, questionable. He sets the stage to make it appear Jason Rich's sister, Jana, has conspired and paid to have her husband murdered. The remainder of the book delves deeply into the personal lives of Jason, Jana and the various colorful characters in their small Southern town. Their lives are rife with alcohol abuse, drug abuse, marital infidelity and various sorts of criminal activity. Bailey has done a masterful job of misdirection with the setup of the story. Though Jana is not guiltless in the way she conducted her life, Jason needs to prove murder is something to which she wouldn't resort.

The book moves along at a smooth pace with the suspense and excitement building as we move toward Jana's climactic trial. Bailey continues to use misdirection as Jason and the reader are taken down some frustrating blind alleys which make the mystery all the more delectable. He does a good job of detailing Jason's trial strategy but spares us the tedious procedural details of gathering the information needed to build his case. The mystery takes a major but believable twist at the trial's climax leaving the reader satisfied that justice has been or will be done.

They just seem to get better and better except for one I couldn't even read because it was so offensive. ""Rich Blood"" is the first book I've read by Robert Bailey, and I just finished it. I'm already looking for another book by him because this book was absolutely fantastic! I'm a paralegal so I know the legal procedures, terminology, etc, in the story were extremely accurate. The plot was fascinating and kept me on the edge of my seat. I hated for anything to interrupt my reading because I didn't want to wait to find out what happened next. If you haven't read a book by this author, please start with ""Rich Blood."" I think you'll be as happy as I am that I discovered another legal author who can hold my interest just like John Grisham always does. I've read almost all of the Grisham legal thrillers. He's one of my most favorite authors. I'm going to read more by Robert Bailey and decide if he is in my category with Grisham. Bravo Mr Bailey!!

Jason Rich is an ""ambulance chasing"" type of attorney and he's made a lot of money doing it (I enjoyed the author's insights on this) but he's also a mess. At the start of the book, he's finishing off a 90-day stint in rehab for alcohol abuse. He's in trouble with the bar association and teetering on the brink of disaster. His personal life is also a mess because he's also recently divorced. The author makes sure that we know that this guy is not a typical hero. He then hears that his sister is being accused of murdering her husband and has asked him to help. His sister is just as big of a mess as he is. They haven't seen each other for years after they fell out around the time of their father's funeral. The reason Jason gets involved is because of his nieces. The reason my stomach was in knots is that the reader is just waiting for the other shoe to drop. Will Jason take a drink again? He flirts with this danger throughout the book. His sister's case looks impossible to win and he has no experience as a defence attorney. I finished this book in a day and now I've got a long wait to read another about this character.

I have always loved to read and i especially love a good ""who dunnit"" in which i cannot determine who did it within the first paragraph. To keep my mind off of my own circumstances i decided to read an author i had not read before. I enjoyed the first books he wrote. We share some things in common. I am from Alabama, my family are not only die hard Alabama fans, but we can recall the great Bear Bryant and of course now Nick Saban. I have been to many of the places he writes about so it is easy for me to place myself in the scenes. I suppose the most important reason I enjoy his books-he is a darn good storyteller. A good Southern storyteller along the same lines as Rick Bragg and Sean Dietrich. Southern writers always tell a good story.",positive
25,Kindle Store,Rich Blood (Jason Rich Book 1),$4.99,4,"I'm not much of a thriller reader, but this book was okay. The characters are well developed as is the locale.

The story itself gallops along at a good pace, but the portion of the book that should have been the highlight was a letdown.

Jason Rich, ambulance chaser extraordinaire is called to act as a lawyer for his sister, who has been charged with organizing the murder of his husband. None of the key people in this book are very nice. The husband is a philanderer, as is his wife. Jason, the attorney has an alcohol problem, and then there's the drug dealer his sister was involved with who likes to threaten anyone and everyone.

The trial doesn't start until the 57% mark, and it moves quickly. The reason I deducted a point is because the trial was too easy. The prosecutor has no personality, and despite Jason's inexperience he makes few mistakes.

Basically, I thought it was too easy. For a thriller to work, it can't be that easy IMO.

The editing is top notch, which is a nice change from the indie books I usually read. Other than that, I think I'll return to speculative fiction and fantasy.

26,Kindle Store,Rich Blood (Jason Rich Book 1),$4.99,4,"hang on for dear life; YOUR dear life!

Robert Bailey’s new book, “Rich Blood”, is a wild ride filled with all things Alabama: football, fishing, fried food, crazy family and a legal system you won’t believe. It’s the absurd theater version of “Mississippi Burning”, by Greg Isles; not quite Dukes of Hazard but if they were related, I wouldn’t be surprised.

Broken down into 6 sections with 84 chapters and an epilogue, Bailey is the master of short attention span theater that appeals to today’s Tik Tok watching reader. For me, a more seasoned bibliophile, that aspect makes for a bumpy ride albeit easy to take a comfort break.

Bailey is also strong in developing characters and dialogue. I fully expect to find this book and sequel showing up as an Amazon Original on the Prime Video listing in the not too distant future. These folks are twisted, emotional, have huge hearts and are colorful to the point of needing warnings for language.

27,Kindle Store,Rich Blood (Jason Rich Book 1),$4.99,4,"I think I had to wait a million years for this book! Ever since I finished Bo's last book, I have been keen to get more words from Mr. Bailey. And alas, the time has finally arrived!

I am not sure what I was expecting with this book. I admittedly did not even bother reading the book description; I just knew I wanted to read it. I thought maybe it would have a similar feeling has the McMurty and Drake series and the Bocephus Haynes series. I couldn't have been more wrong. Sure, they're all lawyers, but this one has a completely different feel to it.

If I had to describe this book using other books, I would say it's a bit of a cross between his previous two series and the Jake Brigance (Grisham) series.

This book took me on some turns that were smooth and some turns that were bumpy. The plot and characters were fully developed and complex. I definitely love myself some complex characters. From alcoholism to adultry to drug dealers... This book has a little bit of everything.

I am now anticipating the next book in this series.... which releases next year. (Cue the tears.)",positive
28,Kindle Store,Rich Blood (Jason Rich Book 1),$4.99,4,"When I see a book out by Robert Bailey, it is first on my list!!!

This one starts a new series about attorney, Jason Rich. He is one of the lawyers, where you see the billboard ads for. His slogan - Get in an accident, Get Rich! He is just finishing up time in a drug rehab center for drinking. He just got in trouble on his last case and is now in danger of losing his license, if he doesn't quit drinking and clean up his act.

He barely has time to get out when he is receiving calls from his sister, Jana, who he hasn't seen in years. They never got along and she always made him feel everything was his fault when it was really hers. Now, she is begging him to help, she is in jail for the murder of her husband.

Jason has mixed feelings about going back home and even helping her, but she has two daughters, that will need him and they have asked for him to help. So, Jason, is on the way home. He has never tried a criminal case, but can he defend his sister when he thinks she might be guilty. Loved the twist in the end!",positive
29,Kindle Store,Rich Blood (Jason Rich Book 1),$4.99,5,"This is by far one of the best First Read (ie, free) books Amazon has ever offered. Even though the setting takes place in Alabama and constantly mentions their football program, it was still really good. There were a few things that seemed forced or unbelievable, like when the District Attorney spent all of two minutes questioning the star witness for the defense, but the rest of the lawyering was just fine. The author did a fine job of setting up future books, planting seeds of a blood feud as well as giving the protagonist a possible love interest. And the passages about the hardships of addiction seemed personal and relevant. I'd have liked a bit more meat on the bone - more character development for folks like Chase and Cade - but perhaps that will come later. Anyway, great read!",positive

Epic life passed my ‘chapter test’ with Flying Colors.

With names like “The Perfection of Patterns” - “Are You an Alley Cat?” “Avoid Boring People…And Avoid Boring People” & “The Only Thing You Can Do Wrong is Do Nothing” it’s easy to want to keep turning the pages.

I also like books that mention me (page 78 - yes, my ego can be stroked)!

I give Justin a lot of credit to have written this - his 2nd - book about being an entrepreneur after only having been one for a short time. It might be easy to blow off some of his advice and beliefs as ‘too fresh’ or ‘not time tested enough’ based on his entrepreneurial tenure.

But doing so would be a mistake in my view.

It’s often the people who are newest to anything who bring the insight that those who’ve been doing it longer fail to see.

Justin Breen and his Epic Life may not be for everyone - but it is surely for him. And that’s the point.

Use the experience of reading this book to think about and design your own Epic Life - the one that feels right to you.

36,Kindle Store,Things We Never Got Over,$3.99,4,"The book gave me that sad, nostalgic feeling of ""wow that was a really beautiful book.""

1) The book is a beautiful story about overcoming trauma - specifically fears about falling in love. This happens for a lot of books (I'm thinking Ugly Love as another popular romance book). But really this book has realistic trauma situations and there are so many pages that you really see the characters change and unravel from their pain points. So by the end, I really understood the two main characters (there are alternating chapter POVs!). The author explained in the note at the end that some of her friends had some tragedies happen to them while she was writing this book, and that helped her realize this book would be about choosing to love even when you know it could hurt. It's definitely the message and theme of this book so it's super good in that way. This book doubles as a therapy session tbh. In the world of mental health/relationship psychology, I would highly recommend this book. You're basically watching an anxious-avoidant relationship both become more secure (hence the title of the book: Things We Never Got Over)

2) This book is too long. I'm really not kidding. The first 20 chapters should have been cut in half like at best. The author said in the author's note she did not know what the book would be about when she wrote it, I kinda see that still. It's just a lot of romance building and when I tell you the second half of the book is SOOO strong with all the conflict and juicy drama, the length of first half was not needed. Like not needed. As someone who reads a lot of scripts for shows/movies, I am a big fan that every word on a page as a writer should be earned, and so much of the beginning was truly boring to the plot. I am impressed by the original readers who kept on going and then gave the book high reviews. I truly just kept on reading because this book was talked about so much that I had to see the hype. In Hindsight, I would have read a summary online for the first half of the book and then skipped to chapter 21 and started reading the book from then on. Still would have been an over 300-page book to read.

3) This should be an exciting series! The author interweaves other characters' love lives so there will be more books in the future that let us see these other characters fall in love. I am so excited cause Lucy and Sloane brought the heat that sometimes I was more engaged in their bickering than in Noami and Knox's.

4) There's sunshine / grumpy love and then there's like good girl submissive energy / bad boy dominant energy love and this relationship is more the latter. Grumpy guy's usually aren't rude to the actual girl (they are more like thoughtful grumpies...like Adam Carlsen or Luke Danes). This guy at the beginning was just straight rude to the female lead. I was like now what the heck. And home girl had like no backbone to him, for 90% of this book. Like he straight disrespected her many times so I wasn't really into him as a character. I just have a distate for men treating women like garbage but then buying them gifts and so its supposed to be okay? (um no.) until of course then in the end I got more proud of him over time, but to me he's definitely a guy where he's not really my type. (But for those who read the book, I'm probably more of a girl like Sloane.) So yes just a heads up for readers, it's more of the good girl / bad boy chemistry.

5) LOTS of relationship psychology and psycho-analyzing. Sometimes I liked it, other times I felt that the author copied and pasted therapy quotes online and put them into the book. As in it was very generic quotes about choosing love over fear. This book is full of a lot of emotionally unintelligent grown adults being told things they should have learned in their 20s. How have both of the leads not worked through their relationship patterns by now or been told them before? These are conversations people usually have in their 20s, but it might just be a generational thing that people are learning how to heal later. But just a heads up that characters are being told advice that seemed very young to hear for their age. They easily could have been in their 20s in terms of their behavior.

Overall:

Really great book about trauma and choosing love over fear! Way too long of a book, really strong second half, and would highly recommend it if you like good girl/bad boy love tropes or like relationship psychology since there is a lot of relationship psycho-analyzing that the characters do with each other.",positive
37,Kindle Store,Things We Never Got Over,$3.99,5,"Grumpy man who is unable to stop thinking about woman, said woman’s life turning upside down after her twin sister stole her money, car, and then found out she had an eleven year old niece! Talk about a lot going on for Naomi Witt. This story had everything I could possibly want and more from the grumpiness of Knox, Naomi trying to figure out the whirlwind mess that became her life, and somehow in the mist of all the drama, love found a way, and there were some added heartfelt moments as well as funny moments too!

Right from the start, Naomi had just come out of a big mess, but just when she thought things couldn’t get any worse, her twin sister Tina, stole all of Naomi’s things, and left her to care for her niece, Waylay, who she didn’t even know existed. Add into the mix the ever so grumpy and tough Knox, who seemed to not only make Naomi angry, but frustrated both mentally and physically *wink, wink. Knox seemed annoyed yet somehow fascinated by Naomi from the way she carried herself to low key checking out her Facebook to see everything about her, to having some spicy dreams about Naomi that left him wanting her in ways he had never felt before. Not to mention, Knox downright telling Naomi to her face that she wasn’t his “type” haha very funny Knox because based off the way he acted towards her throughout the story would seem otherwise. So you could only imagine the tension that occurred between Naomi and Knox was both a pleasure and entertaining to watch unfold.

I loved seeing Naomi adapt to the new changes in her life a.k.a. trying to care of Waylay and trying to be the best guardian she could be for her, especially since Tina (Waylay’s mom) never cared for her, and treated her badly. Naomi wasn’t the only one who cared for Waylay, but also Knox, Nash, Liza J, and Naomi’s parents, and the whole town of Knockemout. Having those people rally around Waylay and provide her with both love and support was so heartwarming to see. Plus you could tell that Waylay appreciated having that sense of true family around her since she never really had that to begin with. Naomi struggled in the beginning trying to grapple with ways to connect with Waylay, and provide her with all the necessities she could possibly need and want. Thankfully with the residential grumpy man that was Knox, he definitely went above and beyond to help Naomi with Waylay.

Through the drama that came with Tina and trying to make sure Waylay was taken care of, Naomi had a lot on her plate, but somehow during all of it, she caught the eye of Knox. What I found so amusing with Knox was that he was aware that he was grumpy and *cough a bit rude to Naomi, but what also made me laugh was that he would sometimes complain about constantly thinking about Naomi or felt kind of annoyed having to pull her out of trouble. In all honesty though, Knox wanted to help out Naomi because he genuinely wanted to be there for her. If anything, Knox wasn’t use to the feelings that Naomi brought out in him, and therefore resorted to being his grumpy self and blamed his body’s reaction to only wanting Naomi in a purely physical way. Haha joke was on Knox because based off the chemistry he and Naomi had, their connection went beyond just physical. While I will say, the passion between those two was AMAZING (especially reading it!) the spice, the dirty talk, and pure wanting lust between was… WHOA! And of course we can’t forget how demanding and possessive Knox was over Naomi.

In addition, I loved how Knox became sort of Naomi’s unofficial yet official caretaker, provider in a way. Naomi was so use to taking care of everyone from always cleaning up Tina’s messes to literally doing everything for Ex in her previous relationship, Naomi did it all! Knox saw that Naomi always put others needs before her own, and he wanted to be the one to take care of Naomi. Something in the pit of Knox’s gut just had this natural instinct of protection over Naomi, wanted to be her “hero”.

This story was absolutely amazing! I loved that with each chapter, I was drawn in more by the characters, the plot, and the overall feeling I got while reading. I couldn’t put this book down, and if I wasn’t reading it, I was thinking about it constantly! I especially loved the tight knit community that was in Knockemout. How everyone helped one another, came together as a community, and the overall support everyone provided for Naomi and Waylay. This story captured my heart, Naomi and Knox definitely had some bumps in the road, but they ultimately had their “happy ending”. Just when I thought the story ended on a beautiful note, the epilogue& bonus epilogue had me weeping tears of joy. Do yourself a favor and read this book.",positive
38,Kindle Store,Things We Never Got Over,$3.99,5,"I bought this e-book version back when it was available to all (in fact, I'm pretty sure I pre-ordered it because I have fallen in love with Lucy's writing!). Since then, Lucy has sold her UK rights and this version is no longer available to buy (I live in Aus, so I assume that is connected to those book rights). I'm now redirected to the UK publisher one. Why am I writing about this? Well, I also bought the audible version. And I don't usually do this, but I ended up reading along with the narrators. So I noticed that the audible version has a bonus epilogue set about five years into the future that isn't in my ebook. I don't know if this is an audible extra, or an extra that was added at a later date, but I no longer have access to because I own the US copy which shows me it's not for sale in my country. Either way, if you can get a hold of that epilogue, you need to. It was that amazing cherry on top of an already delicious cake.

I don't know why, but this story (at least at the beginning) really reminded me of the Kristen Ashley book, Sweet Dreams. The whole gruff, closed-off, rude alpha-male. The likable heroine who seems like a snob (but isn't) that everyone falls in love with. The small town, the interactions which always go wrong, and yet you feel the chemistry jumping off the page. But where I can't really go back and reread Sweet Dreams without wanting to bang my head against a wall (Tate is actually a red-flagged, gross hero when you look back with 2022 eyes), this one rights a lot of those wrongs. For one, Naomi is smart, she's strong, she's super funny, and after what happens toward the end of the book, she picks herself up and fights on. I liked that. Yes, she's flawed, and she definitely makes some questionable choices, but I really liked her.

I also really liked Knox. He had his stubborn moments which lead to acting like an idiot, but he was so lovable. He was protective, sweet, romantic in his own way, and he grew within the story.

All of the secondary characters added warmth and humour to the world. I'm also super excited to read more about Nash and Lucien, as well as anyone else Lucy will give us. Is it too much to ask that Lucy give us an m/m romance about Stef? *pleading puppy dog eyes*

If you love small-town romance which have plenty of humor, super hot sex, and a romance to make you swoon, then I highly recommend you buy Things We Never Got Over. And then if you love this one, definitely go check our Lucy's Riley Thorn series. I got similar vibes with this story.

Finally, the audible version was fantastic and I highly recommend it. Well worth the credit!",positive
39,Kindle Store,Things We Never Got Over,$3.99,5,"Loved this book! Love how it began by explaining how November 9 was a hard day for Fallon because it’s the anniversary of the day a fire almost took her life. That fire left scars all over her body that took away her self confidence. On one November 9, Fallon meets up with her dad at a diner to eat, where she meets a guy named Ben. They immediately hit it off, as he is the first to make her truly feel beautiful, scars and all. However, Fallon is set to move to New York the next day, and her mother always told her that a woman finds herself between the ages of 18-23, so to basically not settle down during those ages. So, Fallon and Ben agree to meet up every November 9 for the next 5 years. They are to have no other contact throughout the year until this day. Well they meet up each year, and things happen in their lives that cause turmoil. One November 9, Fallon discovers Ben’s manuscript and starts reading it and reads that Ben was responsible for the fire that almost took her life. This was huge, because up until now, she thought her father was responsible for it. She ends up reading more of his manuscript and realizes he set the fire for pure reasons. Ben’s mom committed suicide when he was 16. He had no suspicions for her to do this, so he starts checking her phone and he blames it on Fallon’s father since they had been having frequent conversations. When he gets to Fallon’s fathers house, he’s cleaning his prized car, seemingly unfazed by the news that his lover has died. This pissed Ben off so he wants to burn what he loves the most, his car. However, it ends up catching the house on fire, where Fallon was unbeknownst to him. She ends up forgiving him though and they live happily ever after. Such a sweet story.",positive
40,Kindle Store,Things We Never Got Over,$3.99,5,"This is book was all over my reading recommendations. I have read many Bad Boy/Good Girl stories that reading another one was not really exciting; at first… I decided to finally start reading it after weeks of buying it and boy was I hooked! Yes, the first 15-20 chapters felt infinite and it took too long for the spice to start. I didn’t like that I had to read about a third of the large book to start getting the adrenaline rushes which is what I read for, but I believe it was worth the wait though. The buildup in their relationship and their personality developments made the story 10 times better than your usual romance novel. The Bad Boy/Good Girl part of it was not as cliché as I thought it’d be. It had it’s own spice and originality to it and I loved it. It was new for me to read a romance novel of a couple in their late 30s and early 40s but it made it so much more real and interesting to read. I was so into it I felt every single thing like I was in it. The love, the rage, the sadness, the joy. I even want to have kids now.

Anyways definitely recommend if you’re a sucker for a hate to love romance, with lots of intense love making, and a good plot going on around them.",positive

There's another series that I connected with in audiobook, the Lexi Blake Butterfly Bayou books, they are awesome. But I was ready for a new place and people and didn't know I'd find them in Knockemout. This is the first book, and the second is in preorder. If you like the small town ambiance and bigger than life characters, this will please you, too. Some angst, but nothing so heavy it doesn't smooth out eventually.

42,Kindle Store,Things We Never Got Over,$3.99,4,"Ok listen - this isn't going to be the BEST BOOK YOU'VE EVER READ.
But it will hold your interest, you will want to keep reading, you might get a laugh, and well.. let's just say it might light a fire in your southern regions.
Some of the dialogue isn't exactly believable (no one calls people names THAT often in one interaction), but it was easy for me to ignore that - just chalked it up to me not being crazy about the author's writing style - or maybe that was just character development that I didn't quite jive with. Additionally some of the life-stuff wasn't all that believable either -- but again, easy to ignore. Overall, the characters were fun to get to know (there were little bits and pieces of their lives you keep putting together as the book goes on), it pulled at your heartstrings and you wanted the ""good guys"" to win, plus there was TONS of sexual tension that... well ultimately ended up in some pretty steamy scenes that were raunchy for sure, but also pretty dang exciting. If ya catch my drift.
And regarding the swearing/sex - it's a mature novel. I would not let my teenager read it. I wasn't overly offended but there were some instances where I thought it was unnecessary and slightly awkward. There are some explicit sex scenes that are very descriptive so... if that's not your cup of tea, don't bother with this one. But if you're like ""meh, one or two steamy scenes won't hurt as long as that's not ALL this book is about"" - then give it a read!
I think it's definitely worth the $4 to purchase on kindle, I'm not sure I would spend the extra for a hard copy. Maybe, if I want a steamy read, I'd read it again someday.",positive

BEST READ OF 2022 ❤️ I’ve never loved a book so much before! I didn’t want it to ever end 😩 it absolutely deserves all the stars!
Score painted a wonderful image of what Knox looks like in my head & holy hell is he one gorgeous Viking! 🤤 tattoos, muscles, tall, outdoorsy = my kind of man
There’s just something about small town romcoms! Like I actually want to live in Knockemout now!
I loved every single character even though there were times Knox was a little too grumpy!
The witty banter had me laughing + giggling throughout. I don’t think I’ve ever had a book make me smile so much before!
There’s a little bit of everything in this story from family drama to mystery to falling in love but Score ties it all together so impeccably well 🤌🏼 *chefs kiss*

44,Kindle Store,Things We Never Got Over,$3.99,5,"Really enjoyed this story. Naomi is a unique h, sometimes a bit maddening as she gives all to others and puts herself last. The difference is she is loved and appreciated for it while those around her try to convince her to ask for what she wants more. She’s not a doormat or weak, although why she lets her evil twin take advantage is a puzzle at times. Her strength is in helping and caring for others. She is left homeless, car less, and broke in a small town and saddled with an 11 yo niece she never knew about, courtesy of her bad twin. Knox is such a lovable but broken curmudgeon. He gives Naomi grief while also looking out for her in his own way. It takes some dangerous events before Knox realizes he can’t live without Naomi and her sassy niece. Waylay and even the dog Waylon add tons of humor and warmth to the story. Secondary characters in the small town make you want to live there. I don’t know if it was unintentional, but certain elements reminded me a lot of Sweet Dreams by Kristen Ashley. Knox reminded me of one of Ashley’s protective, possessive alphas and the scene where Naomi overhears Knox calling her uppity and needy feels like it was straight out of that book. I loved that book so I might be off base with my comments. There is a mystery running through the story and some elements of danger, but not enough to be considered romantic suspense imo. I found myself tearing up a few times and that’s the sign of a great story.",positive

It's a thriller but not a psychological thriller (although there is a psycho). The story begins with Naomi, a runaway bride racing to the aid of her twin sister, Tina (afore mentioned psycho) who has skipped out on her young daughter. Naomi, being the good twin, cares for her niece, starts a new life and enters a relationship with the town's hot bad boy. Of course,they both have baggage and work on a budding relationship with some steamy scenes that might require a cold shower for the reader. Mystery and criminal intent enter into the mix as well. There's a full cast of interesting characters and a good storyline that is funny, thrilling and endearing. I would recommend it for a fun romp!",positive
46,Kindle Store,Pen Pal,$3.99,5,"It Is A Unique Take On Dante’s Classic The Divine Comedy. This Story Has A Lot Of Steam, But There Is So Much More To It.

This story is inspired by a character in book three of the Queens & Monsters series, Savage Hearts. Riley, who was kidnapped by Russian assassin Malek, wrote in her captivity. The story Riley wrote takes shape here.

The story opens in January on Bainbridge Island. With a population of about 25,000, the island sits in the Puget Sound just off of Seattle and is a short ferry ride away from the city.

Kayla Reece, thirty, can’t bring herself to take off her wedding ring. Grieving the loss of her husband, she finds herself lost. She doesn’t want to relive the nightmare – the drowning accident that took Michael from her – so she pushes it down and tries to move on. With a B.A. in Fine Arts, she is an illustrator of children’s books. Michael had been disappointed that she didn’t go on to graduate school, but she didn’t believe it was necessary. He had taught at the University of Washington in the math department and became head of their Ph.D. program; he placed a high value on education. When he was promoted, he and Kayla had bought a large old home on two waterfront acres on Bainbridge. They enjoyed staying in and spent much of their free time on endless renovation projects. They had been married just six years when Kayla lost Michael.

Kayla is not a people person. She doesn’t trust easily and prefers to keep to herself. She works from home, which lends itself to her misanthropic leaning. Other than Fiona, who comes to clean every Monday, her life is rather quiet. She tries to throw herself into her illustrations, but the rainy Bainbridge weather becomes a problem when the old roof springs a few leaks. The electricity also seems to be on the fritz. Getting a contractor is a problem and finding someone she can trust to do the job is an even bigger problem. It doesn’t help matters that she has been suffering from headaches and occasional confusion since Michael’s death.

When thirty-five-year-old Aidan Leighrite of Seattle Roofing shows up at her door covered in tattoos and looking like trouble, Kayla is surprised by her attraction to the stone-faced intimidating stranger. He is not her type at all. For reasons she doesn’t understand, she tells him that she recently separated from her husband rather than telling him the truth. They immediately begin bickering, which strangely seems like flirty banter, but she isn’t yet convinced that she can trust him. She and Aidan cross paths again, and soon Kayla finds herself doing things entirely out of character. Her connection with Aidan is unexplainable. With him, she feels free and more alive than ever. His dominant ways in the bedroom excite her, and they are quickly immersed in steamy role-play. She has never had so much fun in her life.

Like Kayla, Aidan has an aversion to people. He has an ugly past as well. He is honest, but at the same time, he keeps his cards close to his vest. Kayla thus justifies her secrets, which seem rather inconsequential to her. As she and Aidan begin a physical relationship, they slowly get to know one another. They both sense that they are somehow meant to be, but there are still many things that separate them. Kayla continues to wear her wedding ring, and while Aidan understands that she is still grieving and doesn’t want to rush things if she isn’t ready, Kayla continues to avoid dealing with her loss. The recent electrical issues in her home and other strange happenings have left Kayla with insomnia; she is a nervous wreck when Aidan is not around. When Fiona suggests that a ghost might be the cause of her troubles, it only exacerbates Kayla’s terror.

To add to all the odd occurrences, Kayla has been receiving letters from a man at the Washington State Penitentiary. She assumes he saw her husband’s obituary and decided to reach out to her – perhaps he thinks she has inherited money. His messages are odd, and despite her better instincts, she begins writing back. Her unlikely pen pal becomes more loquacious over time, but Kayla struggles to understand the letters’ meanings.

Kayla’s journey is an uphill battle. Her grief weighs heavily on her, yet she wonders at how quickly she falls for Aidan. It feels natural. At the same time, however, she becomes aware that she is losing her grip on reality. The strange phenomena overwhelm her. She wants to reject Fiona’s suggestion that a ghost is behind it all, but over time, she becomes so desperate for answers that she begins to wonder if there might be something to it. Kayla’s struggles eventually earn her a happy ending.

Wow! Fans of Dante Alighieri’s classic The Divine Comedy will love Kayla’s story, which follows a similar pattern. Part one is Inferno, two is Purgatorio, and part three is Paradiso. It becomes evident early in the story that someone is dead, but who and how many are dead is unclear. The suspense will have you changing your mind repeatedly. I was prepared to be angry in the end, certain that things wouldn’t add up, but there is an excellent and thorough explanation for the confusion. Just be patient and enjoy the ride.

This is a lovely story about death and the afterlife, even if it does take some time to take shape. There were two teary parts at the very end. It was beautiful. This is no typical romance, and yet it is still very much a romantic suspense. It is also incredibly steamy. Aidan and Kayla jump into a very physical relationship quickly. For Kayla, it is out of character, but it makes sense for them as a couple. Their deep and instant connection draws them together, and yet neither has much to say. In fact, they often end up staring at one another, neither willing to break the silence. Neither is quick to open up, so they bond physically and the rest follows.

Tragically beautiful, Aidan and Kayla’s steamy romantic suspense is a fabulous surprise. It is a unique take on Dante’s classic The Divine Comedy. This story has a lot of steam, but there is so much more to it. Their story is about life and love as well as death and despair. It is about ghosts and hauntings as well as crime and mental health. Notably, it is about revenge. The story is thoughtfully written. It is plot-driven. The suspense keeps you turning the pages as the story slowly unfolds. The story is told in three parts. Part one is the bulk of the book. It is Kayla’s story. Part two gives a peak at Fiona and Aidan’s points of view. Part three reverts back to Kayla’s. There is also a brief epilogue. The characters are carefully crafted and three-dimensional. The couple’s chemistry is fantastic. I absolutely love the banter – there is a dry sense of humor at play. The story is told in first person in Kayla’s POV, with one chapter each in Fiona’s and Aidan’s POVs. I rate this book five stars.",positive
47,Kindle Store,Pen Pal,$3.99,5,"I love finding a book that has caused a bit of an uproar only to devour it in a day because it's that FREAKING FANTASTIC! With Pen Pal, that is precisely what happened and this satisfied reader couldn't be happier to have picked up this gem. J.T. Geissinger has crafted a bold, fresh journey, full of some dark humor and paired with erotic sex scenes that were all kinds of fabulous. I went into this book blind and recommend everyone do the same thing, avoiding those annoying and rude spoilers some ARC readers couldn't help but post early on. I was taken on a ride I didn't want to end never quite knowing what end was up but wildly happy, regardless.

There are times of pure joy carefully juxtaposed with supreme grief and guilt as Kayla Reece is floundering daily. Trying her hardest just to simply exist in her new normal after a profound loss, the appearance of Aiden Leighrite seems almost heaven-sent. What follows are a series of passionate trysts together with soul-baring secrets, even though the most important is kept close to the vest. Add to that the fact that Kayla is trying her hardest not to lose her mind and somewhat failing in that department. But all the heavy aside, holy moly, Kayla and Aiden burn up the sheets, kitchen table, living room rugs, etc., etc., etc.... like you can't believe. I do know together with many of my fellow reviewers that I'll never look at the term ""bunny"" quite the same way again.

The story takes a sharp turn with my jaw dropping to the floor after all my own 'theories' about what was truly going on with Kayla, Aiden, and the mysterious Dante gets blown right out of the water. My less-than-stellar detective skills when trying to figure out just exactly what was happening right under my nose only made this reading experience that much sweeter.

I am completely in awe of Geissinger's writing skills and her ability to conjure up such an exquisite story that can be both heartwarming and a bit sinister all in one chapter. This is truly the kind of book I love getting lost in and it will most definitely be a reading highlight for 2022.

Ignore the negative reviews and those who can't appreciate the unique way this book tells a tale. Oh, and it IS a romance albeit an unconventional one, but it is no less intense nor precious than what you might be used to. I loved it hard and happily give Pen Pal a huge 5 stars!",positive

I wasn't ready to move on yet so I dove right back in an hour ago and reread all my favorite parts! We won't talk about how long it took to reread my favorite parts! PEN PAL is on my TOP TEN READS OF 2022 list! NO DOUBT!

I’ve been slowly dying in this house the last three days with this book. I kept trying to slow myself down for fear of missing something so vital yet also rushing to the next page as quickly as I can because I needed EVERY LITTLE THING. I am still shaken from this book, these characters, this world...THIS AUTHOR! This is my second book that I've read by Geissinger and she's completely blown my mind for the second time! I was completely engrossed in this story from the first words! The writing and plot twists kept me until the very end! Books like these are my absolute favorite! The books with amazing characters, exquisite writing and intriguing plots that keep not only my heart and emotions completely bewitched but also my mind engaged throughout 100% of the book.
Just know that I fell in love very early on in this book. Smitten from first meeting and my heart just fell deeper and deeper with every single moment I got thereafter. The love story found within this book is simply stunning and extraordinary! The way that this one snagged my soul...I will never be the same after this book. Geissinger made me fall so deep in love with a character that my husband might accidentally get called the wrong name at some point. Whoops! Okay, seriously...TWO characters completely stole my heart while reading this book.

I will NOT spoil anything! AT ALL!
But I will say this one thing! THIS IS A DARK ROMANCE WITH THEMES THAT CAN BE TRIGGERING! IF you have any triggers and are worried about it, please do yourself a favor and read the author's trigger warnings before you start.
IF you have none and truly enjoy going in blind to a book and getting your mind completely ravaged by fantastically written books then I'd suggest going in blind to this one!",positive
49,Kindle Store,Pen Pal,$3.99,5,"I first discover JT Geissinger from her Queens and Monsters series and was instantly hooked on her artful, yet humorous storytelling style; however, this story is something else entirely. As a fan of any type of dark romantic fiction, I chose to go in blind and was NOT disappointed. This story starts off on a very somber note, with our main character Kayla attending a funeral. While Kayla is in mourning, she is forced to deal with not only a house that is falling apart around her, but inexplicable cold spots in her home, loud noises, and odors that seemingly have no point of origin. On top of all of this, her lapses in memory and letter addressed to her from the mysterious Dante begin to make her question her sanity. Even though Kayla is certain that she doesn’t know anyone confined within a penitentiary her new pen pal Dante assures her that they are acquainted. As Kayla attempts to have her crumbling home fixed, she contacts local contractor Aidan. After fighting guilt and attraction for Aidan after her perceived betrayal of her husband’s memory, Kayla and Aidan embark upon a passionate exploration of their budding romance and HOLY HOTNESS!!! Their love scenes nearly melted my IPad. Their chemistry was absolutely amazing. You as the reader are rooting for their happily ever after and you WANT Kayla to let go of the past until you get to THOSE scenes…those scenes ripped my heart out before the final scenes stitched me back up and wove me back together. Any book by JT Geissinger will be a one-click purchase from me. I will buy this audiobook as well when it is released because all of her books’ audio productions have been top-notch. Do yourselves a favor and buy this book.

Side note: Its probably not often that people comment on the Acknowledgments section of a book, but a big thank you to Ms. Geissinger for sharing her heartfelt personal anecdote on loss. I’m certain that it resonated with many people, particularly considering the massive amount of loss that has occurred over the last few years. This book, as well as her anecdote serve as a reminder that perhaps we are not as alone as we might sometimes think we are.",positive
50,Kindle Store,Pen Pal,$3.99,5,"I could write poetry about how much I love this story. I was lucky enough to receive an ARC copy and I honestly can not wait to have a physical copy in my hands on release day!

This book is so much more than it appears. I have a very high tolerance and went into this book completely blind. For the best reading experience I would recommend doing the same, unless you feel that it isn’t in your best interest then please check the trigger warnings.

Mrs. G, the goddess that she is, gave us spice at 21% into the book. This is one of the most sensual, filthy, & downright most beautiful stories I have read in a long time. I think being in my 30’s is one of the reasons why this story is hitting me so hard (in the best way). I literally had a notebook that I was making notes on with all my theories as I was making my way through this book. Trying to make sense of all the little pieces. And let me tell you, when the pieces came together it was utterly beautiful. There is another strong word I want to use but I do NOT want to give away anything.

Let me back up and just talk about the steam because it definitely deserves some recognition! J.T. Geissinger knows how to write a MAN. My goddess does she know how to write a man…A (who I am keeping a secret) is a pantymelting beast. He was perfection. The scenes were so hot and extremely plentiful! Kayla, FMC, was written with such precision. Again, I believe because of my age and life experiences this story is resonating with me and my appreciation of it is so deep because I understand the rarity of a connection and chemistry of two people. This is the story for the true romantics!

Phenomenal. Magnificent. A work of Art. Mesmerizing. Suspenseful. Mysterious. Thrilling. There are so many feelings I felt and I hope that this book gets the recognition it deserves. It just took my breath away. This story has etched itself on my heart and I will be thinking about it for days to come, just turning over pieces and admiring it. I will definitely be re-reading this as soon as I am able.",positive
51,Kindle Store,Pen Pal,$3.99,4,"Pen Pal begins with Kayla attending her husband’s funeral. She has read that grief entails so much more than just emotions. It is a physical experience too, where all sorts of chemicals are released into the bloodstream resulting in an endless list of possible side effects and Kayla feels as is she is suffering from all of them.

Besides dealing with the loss of her husband, Kayla also has to deal with all the problems in her house – a real “fixer upper” which was seen as an exciting, adventurous project by her and her husband when they were newly weds, but has become more of a burden. It is almost impossible to keep up with all the things that need continuous repairing. And so we meet Aiden, a handy man who is called upon to fix the leaking roof.

Kayla also starts receiving letters postmarked from the state penitentiary. The letters are form a man called Dante, who insists he knows Kayla, although Kayla is adamant that he has mistaken her for someone else as she does not know him.

It was recommended that I go into reading this book blind, to avoid any spoilers, so that is all I will share with regards to the plot.
I really liked the dialogue between Kayla and Aiden. Aiden communicates in a witty, succinct manner which packs a punch. He displayed such a soulful, deep understanding of not only human nature, but of Kayla as well and this is what drew me. I was fascinated by this beautiful soul and their connection. However this was somewhat ruined for me when I felt that the spicy scenes were overshadowing the story for a while. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy heat and spice but at a stage I just felt that that became the focus and the beauty of the story and became secondary.
What I found disappointing was that whilst reading the novel, it reminded me of two movies that I’d seen, which the author later mentions were part of her inspiration for the book. So unfortunately there was no real twist for me, which ruined a huge part of the book for me. Hence my 4 star rating. I would however highly recommend the book and for most, who don’t see the twist coming, it will be sure to be a five star, unforgettable read.",positive

STEAM: 🔥🔥🔥🔥

My grandfather always believed that soulmates would always find each other even if it takes forever. It has been years since he has been with us, but that thought crossed my mind when I finished this book.

Kayla Reece is trying to close a chapter in her life and open a new one. After her husband Michael passed away, she is still processing her grief, but strange things have been happening to keep her from finding peace.

Among them are mysterious letters coming from Dante, who tells her that he would wait forever if he must. The problem is that she doesn't know Dante, why he keeps sending her letters, and why she feels compelled to respond.

Meanwhile, her fixer-upper house is in a disarray, so she ends up getting help from a handyman she can't quite keep her mind and hands off. Is this a manifestation of her grief, or is it related to the mysterious events?

I am aware of the controversy around this book and how it has been marketed, and I get how some people might not agree that this is romance. The beauty of the book world is that every reader brings a unique perspective when they pick a book. We might all read the same words and touch the same pages, but how we take it in is influenced by our life experiences and values. I understand and respect why some people might not consider this a romance or a HEA.

My grandfather's stories about soulmates, my own love story, and other things influence how I view romance and a happy ending. To me, happily ever after is finding peace with the one you consider the love of your life. This is why I really enjoyed this book.

It was definitely a wild journey from beginning to end. Controversy aside, the writing was on point, and the story was very well paced. The mystery and suspense kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time and continually left me guessing. The main characters were very likeable and relatable, and some of the supporting casts will also leave a great impression. (I'm talking to you, Eddie.)

And the spice. J.T. Geissinger writes some of the dirtiest, sexiest spicy moments that will leave you thirsty and hungry at the same time..only not for food.

The book does cover a few sensitive topics, so check out the content warnings before diving in. It is also a standalone.",positive
53,Kindle Store,Pen Pal,$3.99,5,"This novel is a standalone psychological thriller, so said the purchase page. It is also a romance. It is a different sort of both genres. Some won't think it is a romance, but it is. It is just a very dark romance.

NO SPOILERS (I hope)

Kayla is existing in shocking grief and despair from the death of her husband a couple of weeks ago. She is suffering massive headaches and even spotty memory blackouts. Then she gets a letter from Dante, a man in prison, who simply says he'll wait for her forever. She has no idea who Dante is, but writes back. A correspondence begins, but in each letter she remains confused because she still doesn't know him or why he is writing to her--or why she is writing back.

Her house needs repairs and she wants to hire a contractor to fix a major roof leak. Aidan is the one who comes to quote the job. She is drawn to him. And so begins what she considers technically an affair, but she cannot stop herself from being with him. There are other characters in the book, but none are fully fleshed out. That is fine, they didn't need to be and the book would have been worse if they had been.

This story is so full of passion and love, but yet this sense of depression and despair. It is intensely emotional and painful to read, but I couldn't stop. I won't forget this tale. I can't really write more because then I would leave spoilers of some sort, which would really be a big injustice to the author and reader. Instead I will leave a tip: Read this when you will not be interrupted. If you like it as much as I did, you won't be able to stop until it's read through.

54,Kindle Store,Pen Pal,$3.99,5,"I have had Pen Pal in my calendar for months and was patiently waiting it's release (NOT) for what seemed like an eternity. I will read anything by J.T. Geissinger, but when I read the synopsis to Pen Pal, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. So, at 1215am on release day, I purchased it and gave up on sleep to read it.

I have to admit that I always read reviews before I purchase a book, or sometimes even read a sample, but with Pen Pal I knew I had to go in blind. I knew there was a twist in this story and I was going to be furious if someone spoiled that for me in a review. So if you want to get the full effect of this story, your best bet is to go in blind.

I thought I had the storyline figured out. BOY WAS I WRONG!! Ms. Geissinger is an absolutely brilliant story teller. I was so shocked at the end that I missed certain clues she dropped. But then I was so engrossed in these characters that I don't think I was catching certain phrases she used.

I have never read a storyline like this before and I'm so happy a writer like J.T. Geissinger thought of it. I don't think a lot of authors would have the talent to pull it off or make it so nail-biting at times.

I read this story straight through and I am so upset that it's over. This is a story that you will immediately want to re-read - I know I am!

Pen Pal is a 10 🌟 book in my opinion. The story is beautiful, mysterious, funny at times, has lots of endearing characters and the chemistry is out of this world hot! Oh, and the cover is the hottest I've seen in a longgg time! 😍 I haven't been able to buy physical copies of books in a long time but I will scrimp and save to bring this baby home!",positive

First, for those of you who may be sensitive… There are spankings, a strong D/s vibe, chase play, and threatened punishment. although I normally do not like these things in a romance, they weren’t overly strong, they were never abusive in nature, and there was full consent.

I don’t really like books with all of that, but I have to say this book blew me away. It was a total surprise. It hooked me and hung on so tightly that I refrained from doing what I always do in a book, search back when I think I have found a continuity error. I’m sure there are probably some, but I did not care.

The story starts with Kayla at her husband‘s funeral, and it becomes clear very quickly that she is going to her mind is very fragile at the moment. Early on, we see her struggling with physical and emotional issues. She is living in a very old home and starts having trouble with it, such as a roof leak and electrical issues. She calls handymen and contractors, with no luck until Aiden, a roofing contractor, shows up on her doorstep. Meanwhile she’s getting letters from someone in prison by the name of Dante.

I really like how JT writes, I loved the Beautifully Cruel set, and I’ve enjoyed the books that are somewhat related to those. She created a strong, funny character with Kayla, and gave Kayla a brooding, steamy man, Aidan, to challenge her. I can’t say much more than this or else your reading pleasure might be affected. I don’t want to say something that isn’t a spoiler now but becomes one as you read. Let me just say that it’s a good story about a very vulnerable character wading through a mystery and struggling with falling in love.

I can’t recommend this highly enough. Truly enjoyable.",positive

59,Kindle Store,The Washington Post Digital Access,$5.99,5,"The Washington Post is fabulous on the Kindle. We live in the DC area and subscribe to both the daily paper edition and the Kindle edition. I find myself reading the Kindle edition more often. The way the articles are laid out is so much easier to read then flipping through the paper edition to find the articles you want. If there are articles with a lot of photos then I'll refer to the paper edition (the Kindle edition does have a few photos too just fewer). My husband doesn't have a Kindle which is why we still subscribe to the paper edition, otherwise I might be tempted to cancel it. I love the feel of reading a real newspaper sometimes, but if I want to read my news more quickly, then the Kindle edition is great.

The Kindle edition really is the digital format for which I've been waiting. I intensely dislike most newspaper's websites. It is often difficult to navigate, everything is a bit jumbled together with random ads and I find it difficult to find the day's news since everything is rapidly changing. I don't just want to know about the instant news, but also the smaller but still important things that happened in a day. Websites all too often focus on the immediate. So the Kindle edition is fantastic because it's structured yet still static (so if I want to read an article later on, it's still in the same spot, not moved off the front page.)

Just something to keep in mind when considering a subscription ($11.99 month) vs. purchasing each issue individually (75 cents): The subscription issues automatically delete after a few days (the individual downloads never do) so you have to manually save the issues you want. The individual downloads save in your cloud if you delete them, but the subscription issues are gone forever and not saved in the cloud. The only advantage of a subscription is a slight cost savings and automatic delivery. Other than that, there can be quite a few drawbacks. I personally like revisiting old issues for past stories, so it bothers me that the subscriptions automatically delete old issues. Just a note: the way subscriptions are processed is an Amazon quirk that the Washington Post doesn't control, so it's not a criticism of the Post itself. The Washington Post is my favorite newspaper and I'm just delighted that their Kindle edition is so good.

I figured to have another rom-com or tear your heart out by Meghan Quinn but man, this one truly did more for me. I love how the writing described the scenery….as if you were there! The old kingdom, the old abandoned cold castle, to the woods, fish cod lake, and etc. I love how it’s enemies to lovers, giggles all around, and how deep (physically to emotionally) the connection is between the hero and heroine, Keller & Lilly. I mean, it’s like Princess Diaries “for only adults.” Haha. The author did describe this book as a mixture of Princess Diaries, My fair lady, & 50 Shades of Grey. She was truly on point!!!

Emma Wilder narrated Lillly and I just love how she portrayed her as a bubbly, sarcastic, and endearing person. She unexpectedly didn’t know she was royal & will become a future Queen of Torskethorpe but to be one, she has to act like one. She is far from it and so, here comes Keller, who will save the day. Who is he? Well, first off, John Hartley narrated Keller and I just love how he portrayed him as the sweetest, grumpiest, & yet, the sexiest bad boy alpha alive! He will protect her ‘til the time for her to step it up as Queen. These two, I swear, the chemistry was off the hook with their push & pull sexual intense moments!!! Man, it was the cat’s meow!!! They were such a fantastically entertaining audio duet! Thank you so much, Emma for your most fun-loving & hilarious performance as John for your most swoon-worthy & wicked performance.

Meghan Quinn really delivers some laughs on her version of a super smexy My Fair Lady which just so happens to be one of my faves ❤️. Lilly is a very strategically pierced, free spirit who is living her best life in Miami, spraying down contestants in wet T-shirt contests when Keller Fitzwilliam crashes her life and blows up everything she thinks she knows about her family. Keller is tasked with bringing her back to a grandfather she didn't know she had, to a country she's never heard of, to potentially become heir to their thrown. Keller's just got to get her ""presentable"" first. Lilly's bubbly personality ends up being Keller's downfall, but will his insecurities get in the way of their happily ever after?

Royally Not Ready was just a super cute read that gives some great laughs and leaves you with the warm fuzzies. Great storyline with quite a few laugh out loud moments and a twist I didn't see coming. Lilly is just hysterical and unlike anyone Keller has ever met before. She tends to fill in silence with word vomit that leans to the super crass end of the spectrum, lol. She's sassy, but vulnerable and that vulnerability makes the protector in Keller break every rule he has. Keller is the super alpha protector, but he also has the soul of an artist and he can be insecure at times. It made him super relatable and likable despite his screw ups. I felt good about the grovel and grand gesture(s) and finished the book with all the warm fuzzies. Royal romances aren't my favorite, but this one definitely shined!",positive

Once again the author has shown us why she is the queen of romantic comedy books. Every time I read je of her books I feel like I should be watching the movie because these books definitely deserve to be made into romantic comedies and I would definitely be watching and they would be on every ones lists they are so good. This one was just so freaking funny I absolutely loved Lilly omg she had me laughing so much I looked like a crazy person. So I recommend read at home. I loved every single interaction between Lilly and Timmy I mean talk about freaking hilarious. Loved how Lilly would push Keller’s buttons from day one. She doesn’t honor back and I love that about her. Love the king and queen and the bond they have with Keller and the one they form with their Lilija. There was so many secondary characters that made the book so much better and that you can’t help but love and want to know more about. For example Lara I kinda need to know what happens with her because now I’m invested and after what happens with Brimar I just need to know. Then we Han Runa we meet her briefly but she definitely makes an impact and I can’t help but want her to be happy so I also need to know she gets her happiness. I also kinda want to know what happens to Henrik and to Timmy I know I know but I get invested in these characters. I blame the author she writes so beautifully she leaves you wanting more from her characters after you finish her books.

While this book is long, every page is worth it. I was hooked from the first chapter and didn’t want it to end.

Lilly owns a bikini wagon and runs wet tshirt contests in Miami. She is the last person you would think would be in line to the thrown of a country, and she felt the same way, until Keller shows up out of the blue to bring her home so their country’s leadership isn’t lost when the king dies.

From the moment they meet they butt heads, but they also can’t deny the attraction they have for one another. Keller fights it with everything he has, and Lilly being Lilly decides breaking his will will keep her entertained through all the training she has to go through to eventually be queen.

This is definitely the hottest book this author has ever written and when I say I’m here for more of it, I mean that with everything I have. I need more men like Keller!!! He’s a strong, protective alpha who wants to own you in the bedroom but also writes poetry to get his emotions out since he isn’t good at speaking about them.

I absolutely loved this book and it might just be my favorite ever by this author!",positive
70,Kindle Store,Royally Not Ready,$4.99,5,"Meghan Quinn just wrote an epic story about a future Queen and the man meant to train her to be the best Queen for Torskethorpe. Lilly is a woman living in Miami working at a Bikini Wagon when one day a man in a suit, Keller, shows up to bring her to Torskethorpe to meet her long lost grandparents. It isn't until they arrive at Castle there that she learns that she isn't just there to meet her grandparents, she is being asked to be the next Queen since she is the final heir to the thrown.

From the very beginning it is clear that Lilly is an American with a lack of filter. She would say anything and everything that came to mind while training to be Queen with Keller and her two Royal guards. I loved that part of her self assigned prep work for becoming Queen was to watch The Crown and Bridgerton. She constantly made references to the shows because she knew it irked Keller, which lead to the amazing ""Informative"" reports! The banter between Lilly and Keller throughout the beginning of the book provided so much tension that you just knew it would be perfect when they finally made the leap with each other!

Meghan Quinn did an amazing job describing what the palaces and landscape looked like, I could picture everything so clearly as I read the book. I have a feeling we know who the next book ""Royally in Trouble"" will be about and I cannot wait!!

71,Kindle Store,Royally Not Ready,$4.99,5,"This was one of the funniest books I’ve read this year. It definitely have me Princess Diaries vibes right off the bat. It was funny, romantic, angsty, and had enough little gestures to add up to one epic apology tour.

Lilly, the last heir to the throne of Torskethorpe, has been living in the dark her entire life. After she was orphaned she opened a bikini truck with her best friend and is living her life in Miami, meanwhile Keller Fitzwilliam, who was also orphaned at a young age, is sent by King Theo to find Lilly, bring her back to Torskethorpe, and train her to be the royal she was always meant to be. Both Lilly and Keller have a lot of baggage to unpack. There were times I wanted to strangle Keller. Although his loyalty was admirable, it was also holding him back. When he finally gave in to Lilly’s seduction I wanted to cheer out loud.

Keller and Lilly were the seemingly perfect match. They had so much in common but what really made them perfect were their differences and how they balanced each other out. Although I typically don’t like the third quarter break up, I felt it was entirely necessary to this story. Lilly needed to know that while she wanted Keller by her side, she could be a queen on her own.

I loved this book. It was so fun while also touching on some heavier topics at the same time. I thought Lilly’s sunshine to Keller’s grump was perfect and their banter was hilarious. I loved all the side characters, and even though I figured out who the villain of the story was, it was very well written and kept me reading from page one.",positive
72,Kindle Store,Royally Not Ready,$4.99,5,"DEAR GOD. This book had me laughing out loud to panting from how hot the sex scenes were. This has a grown up, dirty humor, steamy version of Princess Diaries vibes....and I am here. for. it. The fact that this book is so steamy, hilarious, and has an interesting plot and story line give it an instant five stars.

I didn't sleep last night because I couldn't put it down. I was planning on reading the first couple chapters before bed but it was too good.

Kellen is definitely at the top of my favorite book boyfriends. He is protective, dominant, sweet, and the physical image I have of him is insane. Lilly is an American wild child who is shocked to find out she's a princess and has family. The banter between the two is one of the best I've read in a steamy romcom.

Am I getting the audiobook now? Yes. Am I going to buy a physical copy of the book even though I have it on my kindle? Yes. Does that makes sense? Probably not but I don't even care. GIVE ME MORE.

sexual tension
enemies to lovers
witty banter
grumpy/sunshine
off the charts chemistry
rom com
dirty talk

Keller is now a new book boyfriend. This man is Delicious and commanding 🔥

Overall this book was hilarious and entertaining. Lilly was a sassy spitfire that kept me laughing often. Keller was just grumpy and oozed seggs

I just wish that there was more time in there main castle and less time being hidden away (even tho there was lot of 🥵 there) I felt that towards the end of the book I was ready for it to end. Not in a bad way per se but sometimes less is more. I don’t need a book to be overly long and detailed it enjoy it.

I think that the “issue” that arose at the end for Keller wasn’t exactly an issue but more of an immature mindset on how things “should be” which honestly was kind disappointing.

With that being said I am so glad I read this and was introduced to these characters!! I am curious to see what the next book will be about!!! (Don’t worry no cliff hangers here)",positive
75,Kindle Store,Royally Not Ready,$4.99,5,As a Fan of the Author I thought this would be another RomCom story. But it's much more than that! Lilly lost both her parents & is living in Miami selling bikinis out of a truck with her best friend Timmy Tuna. But all that changes when she is told she is the Granddaughter of King Theodore of Torskethorpe. And Lilly is the only heir to inherit the throne. The King had sent his private secretary Keller Fitzwilliam to Miami to find Lilly & bring her back to his country so she can be schooled to become a Princess. Lilly is desperate to have some relatives so she decides to go meet her Grandparents & experience what life is like in Torskethorpe. So what follows is how Lilly is kept isolated in a castle with Keller as her teacher & she eventually meets her Grandparents & the citizens of their country. I just wish we didn't have to wait until January of 2023 to read the next book about Lilly & Keller!,positive
76,Kindle Store,The Last Mrs. Parrish: A Novel,$6.99,4,"I enjoyed this book a lot. I guessed the twist early but the book was still very satisfying to read. Without going in too deep and spoiling, I appreciate that this book sort of explodes and critiques certain fantasies that inform a lot of the fiction and film marketed to women. I felt like the Amber character could have been a bit more complicated and layered. I think the plot could have gone the exact same way but having her be more multidimensional could have made things a bit more complex and emotionally weighty and given some shades of grey to how things turn out. She was so consistently terrible and unlikeable that I could never root for her and I think the mark of a truly great point of view villain is when you kind of start wanting them to get what they want.",positive

The end of the book is what disappointed me. *** Spoiler alerts ** Are we to believe that Victoria went to all the trouble of telling her sister Emma she was innocent in her ""last"" phone call during 9/11 attack but never informed her many years later she was alive. Victoria went to all the trouble to set up evidence that would make people think Tess set her up but Victoria was the one on trial for murder, her reason IMO does not make sense. Ok, I can handle one person ""faking"" their death in the story but two people is stretching it. Finally, the detective had affair with his partner's wife and did not know she was his partner's wife.

I could not resist the eerie cover of an eye peeking out of a keyhole, for Freida McFadden’s new book The Housemaid. From that cover and the synopsis, I knew this would be one twisted read and I was right.

Millie has had a tough life. She went to prison for 10 years when she was seventeen-years-old. She has been out on parole for a year when she applies for a live-in housekeeper job she knows once they do a background check, she will not get it, but to Millie’s surprise she does get the job. Unfortunately for Millie the job isn’t what she expected. When she interviewed for the job, the house was pristine and Nina Winchester, the owner, was such a nice person. When Millie showed up for her first day, the house was a mess and Nina was no longer the nice, caring person she was at the interview. Nina is doing everything she can to make Millie’s life a living hell, but Millie needs this job and she will not quit. And then Millie finds herself growing attracted to Nina’s husband, Andrew, and she dreams of what it would be like to be living Nina’s life. Be careful what you wish for, Millie!

This book is told in three parts. Part one is told from Millie’s POV. I liked Millie and sympathized with her as I got more information on her background. Millie is a strong person. When push comes to shove, she does not back down; she pushes back and pushes hard. From Millie’s perspective, we get to see how crazy Nina is. Oh, the things Nina would do! She accuses Millie of stealing her notes for the parent/teacher night and then after destroying the kitchen looking for them, yells at Millie for the mess. Nina has Millie get tickets to a play for a specific night and then accuses Millie of getting the tickets for the wrong night. Nina gives Millie some old clothes and then accuses her of stealing them. Everyday Nina seemed to be spiraling out of control more and more.

The second part of the book is told from Nina’s POV, and it is in this part we find out what is really going on. I didn’t like Nina very much in the first part of the book, but when I found out what was going on, I cut her some slack. Though I liked the outcome she was hoping for, I wasn’t fully on board with how she made it happen. Yes, vague I know, but if I tell you then you wouldn’t be surprised. LOL!

The third part of the book alternates between Millie and Nina and in this part, we see the outcome and aftermath of everything that happened in the book. And what an outcome it was!

The Housemaid was a very twisted and engrossing read. And even though I have read books that are similar in plot and sort of guessed how things were going to go, I still really enjoyed this book. There were lots of twists and turns at the end that did surprise me.",positive
97,Kindle Store,The Housemaid: An absolutely addictive psychological thriller with a jaw-dropping twist,$3.99,5,"AUGUST 2022 : 5 STARS.
DESCRIPTION: Every day I clean the Winchesters’ beautiful house top to bottom. I collect their daughter from school. And I cook a delicious meal for the whole family before heading up to eat alone in my tiny room on the top floor. I try to ignore how Nina makes a mess just to watch me clean it up. How she tells strange lies about herown daughter. And how her husband Andrew seems more broken every day. But as I look into Andrew’s handsome brown eyes, so full of pain, it’s hard not to imagine what it would be like to live Nina’s life. The walk-in closet, the fancy car, the perfect husband. I only try on one of Nina’s pristine white dresses once. Just to see what it’s like. But she soon finds out… and by the time I realize my attic bedroom door only locks from the outside, it’s far too late. But I reassure myself: the Winchesters don’t know who I really am. They don’t know what I’m capable of…

REVIEW: I’ve heard this book is becoming a movie. Lots of friends reviewed this one; gottapeanow said 90% of her psychological facebook group (of 100K members) rave about this author’s books; she tried this one and gave it 5/5 stars; one of the best twists she has ever read. tamiq also gave 5 stars. pjaye gave it 3 stars and thought it was too far fetched. maryland was hoping to read soon. I was excited since it is compared to The Last Mrs. Parrish by Liv Constantine which I loved and gave 5 stars. I recently read The Inmate (‘22) and gave it 3 stars and tamiq gave it 5 stars.
Eeriness and drama start almost immediately. Nina, the wife , is a real nut job and poor Millie, the housekeeper, is desperate otherwise she would have quit on day 2. The action never stopped! I don’t want to say much more to ruin anything. Very very original plot for me. Some might think the ending was a little too perfect, but I LOVED it - 5 Stars !",positive
98,Kindle Store,The Housemaid: An absolutely addictive psychological thriller with a jaw-dropping twist,$3.99,5,"I found my new favorite author and I have a Love Hate…as with any engaging author! I love her because I can get lost in the story…I hate her because…I get lost in the story! First, I read one of her books in 1 day (The Perfect Son) and another one in a day and a half (you guess)! This means I was glued to my bed- couch – bed. The hate is that – well… I was glued! Also…I Need More from her!
So – specifically – the author captures you from the first page. The story is instantly captivating and makes you want to keep reading (hence the late night readings). She keeps the momentum going in 3 ways. First….you are captured by the story that twists and turns. So, you always want to see what is next. Second, she does not get lost in minutia. In other words, every part of the reading has a purpose. For example, she doesn’t go on about the “curvature of the keyboard that Ms. X used…”, or the details of a car ride in a city that I will never be in. For example…”Michael then took route along I-95 that spreads over 20 miles and then transferred to the smaller turnoff of Windsor Lane”. I have seen this other famous authors who spend time explaining what it is like to drive a certain stretch of highway. Instead, I know every part of the story with McFadden has a purpose! Finally, while doing this…the author meets my needs of fulfilling a story without leaving me hanging! In other words, I don’t want to wait 450 – 500 pages for a climax! Her books are reasonable in number of pages and have substories that work themselves out throughout! I may not know who the real killer is until then end. However, there are substories that reveal themselves throughout to keep me moving. It is similar to a TV series with the plot of each week and yet an ongoing thread until the end!

Nina - hated Nina in the beginning. Thought she was a stupid slob with unbalanced emotions. I was not rooting for her in the beginning and was HAPPY when Andrew chose Millie over her.

Nina by the end of the book - my favorite character. So smart and caring.

Andrew - I had a crush on him alongside Millie in the beginning. I was hoping Millie would give him a baby by the end the book

Andrew by the end - Hated him. Was pleased that he died and was my least favorite character for obvious reasons.

Millie - loved her in the beginning

Millie towards the end - I did not expect the darkness she would develop throughout the book. She took on a Dexter (the TV show) type of role and I did not expect that.

I just knew it would be a textbook wife killing the mistress type of situation. I almost stopped reading once Nina left Andrew but the way everything played out was so unexpected!! You think it'll end one way and it ends a totally different way.",positive

It’s a domestic psychological thriller that seemed similar to most books I love to read, so I had a ton of different guesses throughout the first half of the book.

This is probably one of my favorite books I’ve read in the past six months. McFadden has become one of my favorite authors & for psychological thrillers, she’s keeping me on the edge of my seat.

This is a stand-alone but I’d love to see what happens based on the last chapter. I usually can kinda/sorta figure out where a story is going but this one just threw me for a loop. It was so unexpected. I won’t say it’s perfect, there were things near the end that I didn’t understand, like how Millie knew what was behind Nina’s awfulness. It wasn’t explained to her & I guess she was expected to figure it out. But, lest I give it away, I’ll say no more. Psychological thrillers have become my new delicious obsession & if I could find others that had the potential to blow me away with such a clever plot, I’d buy them. I enjoyed this novel so much that I can overlook a couple of places where it got a little draggy & the aforementioned “how did she know”. This is a captivating read.",positive
103,Kindle Store,The Housemaid: An absolutely addictive psychological thriller with a jaw-dropping twist,$3.99,5,"First of all, I would like to say this book is nicely printed in that the pages were thicker and of better quality paper than your typical paperback. It was an easy read as well. Often, I will find myself having to look back to previous pages to double check information about a character, place or something else in the book. I think that oftentimes authors can get a little carried away on too much ""fluff"" to fill up space in the overuse of technical information, adjectives and descriptions of people places and things - this book is not like that. It was direct and to the point which makes it the page turner it is.

I enjoyed the the writer's satirical humor - especially at the beginning of the book. I found myself smiling to myself when reading some of Millie's perceptions of people and situations. The book is a page turner indeed, so much so that I could not put down, I read it in one day but stayed up until 3:30 am. doing so wanting to get to the end. The twists and turns are never ending and I couldn't wait to read what was going to happen next. Some of the other reviews I read said it was predictable and unbelievable. Hmmm, that confuses me a little - how can something be predictable if you couldn't believe it could happen? As is often the case with fiction writing, some of the situations can seem a bit out of the ordinary, but that's what makes for interesting reading. As the spouse of a man who has been a cop for over 30 years, believe me when I say I have heard EVERYTHING, but this book took me in a direction I did not foresee. I'm kind of glad I didn't see it coming because I think if I did it might be a disturbing indication of my own thought process. lol

I'll try my best to recapture it though.

This book was so well developed that I couldn't get enough, I sped through it, happy to get the gratification of a story starting in the middle. You'll feel unnerved as soon as you start reading, there's something tense about the prose, you feel as though you need to look over your shoulder, there's something there if you just look a little closer...

I had no idea where this book was going to go when I first started reading. And that's okay, I long for books to stupefy me and this delivered. I guessed the twist at about the half way point, but that's to the author's credit for making it so believable and realistic. I have to admit, I didn't truly understand what was happening in the house until it was revealed and I can't help but cringe as I think about it.

I've been so curious about Maggie and to find out that her man was going to be Beau had me wanting to pick this book up even more!

Maggie and Beau's journey hooked me and didn't let go! Through the app, Maggie is a domme and is matched with a sub. Little did she know it'd be her friend's son. These two and their story surprised me in the best of ways!

The humanness that was shown by both Beau and Maggie got to me. Getting into their minds and uncovering their true selves was something so beautiful for me. There's no shying away from the tough and I appreciated the realness of it all so very much.

Our ma'am Maggie and our Brat Beau got into my heart in various ways. From the trust to the off the charts heat all the way to the love, I won't forget their story.

Sometimes people come into our lives and crack open our souls to shine in ways we'd never thought possible. Maggie and Beau's journey showed that and more in spades.

My book loving heart was overjoyed to be back with my Salacious Players' Club crew once again! This series is hands down one of my all time favorites! There's something so beautiful to be found with every single installment.

With Praise, Emerson and Charlie's story taught me what it means to be utterly appreciated and adored for who you are. We often forget that to have that be felt and shown to us means everything.

With Eyes On Me, Garrett and Mia's story taught me what it means to be truly seen, truths, and all. We are all going through this battle called life, and instead of judgement you find nothing but understanding and love.

With Give Me More, Hunter, Isabel, and Drake's story taught me what it means to fully embrace who you are and take chances, you never know where your heart and that path could lead you.

With Mercy, Maggie and Beau's story taught me how to find myself. Isn't that what we all try to do? So we can one day look in the mirror and smile back at all you see, because you are worth it.

I've never found a series that has helped me find pieces of myself along the way like this one has. Each book and each couple have touched my life and I will cherish that always. You see, my fellow book lovers, this series digs right down to the very soul and marrow and leaves it's mark. I so needed these books in my life and I am so grateful Ms.Cate wrote and shared them with us. She reminds us to never be ashamed of who you are, embrace yourself wholeheartedly, and be so dang proud.

This is one of my favorite reads of the year! With Mercy, Ms.Cate has outdone herself again with this unputdownable and utterly fantastic read! She makes me blush like no one else with her writing. If you haven't picked up the Salacious Players' Club Series, change that asap! Trust me, this series will own you and your heart so completely! 💛🖤",positive

Maggie is a 34 year old sole female owner of the Salacious Players Club. Beau is the 22 year old son of one of her co-owners. After taking the Salacious quiz, they’re anonymously matched as Domme and Sub and decide to meet at the club on masquerade night.

“It was humiliating,” he replies with a grunt. “Even with me?” I ask, touching his face again. When he looks up, the nothingness in his eyes is better than the guard he usually keeps up. Because at least Beau can have his guard down around me. He trusts me enough for that. “No. You’re the exception.” My heart soars, but I try not to let it show in my expression. Pulling his face closer, I let my lips graze his before I softly whisper, “You’re my exception too.”
*
*
I really loved the growth that both Maggie and Beau experienced in this book. Maggie learned to grasp hold of a newfound confidence, she found her voice. She begins to see herself as Beau sees her - beautiful, strong, and fierce.
Beau had a lot of past trauma from his parents. Never being punished for his actions and having things handed to him - there were never any consequences for him and because of that he never found any real direction for his life.

“I think you’ve been lied to by so much toxic masculinity in your short, sweet life that you believe real men have to be dominant, so you won’t let yourself accept the truth that you’re really submissive, and the idea of a woman taking control over you secretly turns you on.”
*
*
Beau and Maggie needed each other and that’s what makes their story so incredibly beautiful.
*
*
“The irony is not lost on me. Maggie was raised in a purity culture and I was raised in…almost the opposite, and yet, we ended up in similar situations. All of the lies they fed her, my mother was feeding me the same.”

This is such a good stopping point for Salacious (for now). I really hope Sara continues this story line. There’s still so much to work with in this series. I just really love how things have come full circle with their whole crew so far and how all their stories are woven together.

If I could give this whole series more then 5 stars I would cause it's that good . I don't give praise just to make someone feel good but when someone does something great I make it a point to say the words that will light them up and encourage them to continue being their best self, positive affirmations are everything. Sara Cate is is a master with words and story telling. This series was my introduction to her beautiful mind and I am hooked. This series isn't just about shmexsual liberation without shame but Empowerment. But this book even more then the others made me realize how much men need this feeling of Empowerment just like us women. I wish more men would read this book cause I really think they would get something so fulfilling from it. I've used this word before and I'll use again, Beau was beautiful and I'm not talking about his looks ( although he sounded hot af), it was his development, his growth. He wasn't broken, I think he was more unfinished. He's views were corrupted by one bitter parent and sheltered and undisciplined by the love, fear and guilt of the other. Meeting Maggie humbled him to the point where he trusted her enough to allow her to break him and put him back together whole, there's beauty and power in that. Through this he was finally able to accept and forgive himself enough to be able to love himself and fully love others. She to was able to find her strength and acceptance of herself through him as well and that's what made their journey beautiful. Although Maggie and Beau's exact lifestyle isn't particularly my specific kink, there was several elements that I was able to relate to and that helped me be able to put my own shame and biases into perspective and see them so differently. We sometimes don't realize how this purity culture and the lessons that sex should be for procreational purposes and/or a duty to your spouse or even the ideas ingrained in us that in order for men to be real men they have to follow a certain norm is so harmful and dangerous. Thank you Sara Cate once again for enlightening us and opening our eyes, mind and heart. I love this book and I really hope it reaches alot of readers. I know that this isn't in any way a self help book but as far as romance novels are concerned this series has helped and touched me in so many ways and I'm sure they will touch others too. Am I being dramatic much, maybe. Am I building what some would consider this to be just a ""smutty romance novel"" to much, also maybe but I think it's a great book, a great series and she's an awesome writer who has helped me fly me ""freak flag"" proudly.

This is book 4 of the Salacious Player's Club series.
I would say that reading (at LEAST) the first book (Praise) is best to have a firm understanding of the main characters of this story.

Maggie is one of the owners of a successful adult club. She thinks her love life is meant to be ""just vanilla,"" until she downloads and takes the quiz paired to her adult club and finds that she has a dominating personality.

Beau is the son of Emerson, another owner of Salacious. Beau is a twenty-two year old who is just... lost. He doesn't have motivation or a steady job. He has looked down on his dad and the adult club, but decided maybe his love life needed a change. He ends up downloading the club's quiz, takes it, and wouldn't you know... finds out he is a brat with a submi$$ive personality... and matches with some thirty-four year old dö♏️♏️ë. Wonder who that could be? 🤔😏

Beau and Maggie chat through the app, and discover each other's identity... after a (SPICY) meeting under anonymity. They know it's wrong, but they can't ignore their feelings and their body's cravings for one another. But when a new opportunity has Maggie questioning a long distance move, it puts a huge problem along her horizon.

Will Emerson find out that his colleague/good friend is t@ming his son?
Will Beau and Maggie's relationship strengthen and flourish, or will Maggie's move tear them apart?
Will Beau finally stop being a little brat and grow up?! 😆😬

Out of all of the Salacious Player's club books, I personally enjoyed this one the most in the terms of character growth. Witnessing Beau's progress of finally going from a boy to a man was something I was looking forward to since the first book. Not only that, but Maggie was totally relatable. She was super self-conscious of her body, and her confidence oy showed up in her work. When she gets with Beau, her confidence sky-rockets, and she is a super ď0♏️♏️ë! 😳

I DEVOURED this book (per usual for anything Sara Cate writes). There was plot, there was conflict, there were spicy scenes, and I loved the cameos of previous characters! Maybe the new club in Arizona comes with new club owners to read about?? I don't want this series to end!!! 😭

STEAM: 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Beau Grant is having an existential crisis. After all, he is 22 years old, is living with his mom, and cannot hold down a job. He finds no excitement in dating or hanging out with his friends anymore, leaving him with drawing on his tablet and playing D&D with his ex-girlfriend's little sister and her friends.

When his friends managed to convince him to check out his dad's app and find out about his intimate preferences, he did not expect to be matched to the one woman who could challenge him.

Maggie knows that all work and no play make for a dull girl, but she too is in need of self-reflection to find out what she wants from life and in the bedroom. That is, if she can get away from work long enough. When the girlfriends of her business partners -- she supposes she can call them friends -- get her to do the Salacious app, she too did not realize that such a simple quiz will lead her down such a complicated path.

When Sara Cate announced that the fourth book in The Salacious Players Club series was going to be between Beau and Maggie, I was definitely excited because:

1. I have a soft spot for reverse age-gap romances.
2. I love a good redemption arc.
3. Whatever intimate adventures these two have, I know Sara Cate will make me love it.

I was not disappointed at all. The character development in this read is on point. I love the arcs that Beau and Maggie undertake individually and together, and I especially love that they bring out the best in each other. I did feel like the ending was a little rushed, but that took very little away from the overall story.

Sara Cate's spicy writing is like the Club; it has a way of making you realize that you're into things that you didn't know you were into before. I enjoy her exploration of diverse kinks in this series, and the chemistry between Beau and Maggie was hot, hot, hot from the get-go.

This book can be read by itself, but characters from the other books are part of the story. I also highly recommend you read the rest if you're new to this book universe.",positive
111,Kindle Store,Mercy (Salacious Players' Club),$4.99,5,"I’m sure it is a shock to nobody that like all the other books in the Salacious Players Club series; I loved Mercy.

I may be in the minority but I didn’t hate Beau in Praise, wasn’t a huge fan of him but he wasn’t a huge villain and he’s young so there was always room for him to grow. He has grown from when we last saw him, and I enjoy the brotherly friendship he’s developed with Sophie. He has a lot of preconceived notions about his father that has impacted his relationship with him and its more than just having to hear all the bad things his mom would say. There were many moments where I just wanted to hug him.

I don’t think I have ever related to character like I do with Maggie. I didn’t grow up where sex was treated like the worst thing ever, but I also wasn’t raised to be open to it, and I certainly didn’t learn about any kind of kink until I was in my 20s. Since we haven’t seen as much of Maggie in the other books, it was just great to get to know her and see her growth as both her and Beau learn about BDSM and their newly discovered kinks.

There are not enough books where the FMC is the dominant one and it’s honestly a damn shame because there are plenty of females out there that fit that role and would love to read more of it. Sara never disappoints on the spice, and I may have walked away with a few ideas of things I would like to explore more.

I would have liked to see more of Maggie and Beau’s relationship once they landed more in that territory since I feel there is a lot of focus on their learning together as Domme/Sub. However, it’s a small gripe and not one worth taking any stars away for.",positive

thank you @saracatebooks for the ARC✨

i absolutely cannot believe that this series is over. what a year this has been being able to meet and read through four salacious players club books. this is hands down one of the best series i’ve ever read. they will all hold such a special place in my heart because i’ve never read anything like these before. they pushed me outside of my comfort zone and made me think outside the box. i have been challenged in my ways of thinking, laughed, smiled, and cried my way through this series.

this last book was the one i was not expecting at all. maggie has always interested me because she was always so different from emerson, garrett, and hunter. and then to find out that she ends up with beau. i’m not gonna lie i hated him in the first book. but honestly now looking back that is what makes this mercy so good. there is a lot of redemption in this book overall. this is also my first fmc domme book. and boy was this book HOTTTTTTT. like drooling hot. not sure if i’ve even recovered. the best part about him being a brat was that she is ruthless with giving him what he deserves. but also being able to care for him more deeply and know what he needs. there was so much character growth in this book for beau. i’m so glad that we got to also see redemption in beau and emerson’s story. even if sometimes it was uncomfortable. i am completely obsessed with this series. i love maggie and beau so freaking much. i will never get over this whole series. easiest five stars.

I am honestly OBSESSED. I devoured this because I. Could. Not. Put. It. Down. I did attempt to read it slower because I just didn’t want it to be over. I didn’t want the book to be over and absolutely not the series. I mean how do I move on? What do I do with my life? I mean honestly I even waited 2 days to share this review because once its shared I can’t pretend that it still isn’t over.

I think those of us that have read Praise, Eyes On Me, and Give Me More can all admit that Beau wasn’t our favorite character which made us all hesitate a smidge when we found out WHO was going to be with our sweet Maggie. Honestly, though Beau’s redemption is beautiful. To think about who his character was in Praise, and even who he was in the beginning of Mercy, his overall character arc is perfection. Don’t let this book being about Beau deter you.

Maggie…There are so many things that I relate to with Maggie. From being a female in the powerful position / leadership role but still feeling like you are fighting a much harder battle than our male counterparts, to the shame from growing up with purity culture, and the body image struggles. I love her so much and I think its because she felt so REAL to me.

The Chemistry of Beau and Maggie together is seriously CHEF’S KISS. Beau hasn’t had to ever color within the lines. There have been no consequences for his actions and he desperately just wants someone to give him guidance and show him what the rules are. Maggie is ALL ABOUT THE RULES. I mean honestly, its the perfect combo. Also, the fact that we get to go on this kink journey WITH THEM. They are both new and unsure as they go forward. I loved this so much as it felt absolutely real life and encouraged such a healthy open relationship between the two.

I think we all know that the smut is TOP MF TIER. There is one scene that has been on REPEAT in my head and I wanna tell you all about it but I can’t……I can’t spoil it. Just Hydrate you guys.

Good lord… that was 🥵. I love Beau and Maggie’s dynamic together. While they have their Dom/Sub roles they are still learning together… and also finding pieces of themselves they didn’t know they had. It makes them so strong and when they finally realize it they are unstoppable.
So happy to see the father/ son relationship grow into something more and for Beau to learn about/ except his father for who he is rather then who he shows the world. I honestly wish we had more of it… side note I’m not a fan of Beau’s mom even at the end.
I’m glad there wasn’t to much of a power struggle between Maggie and Emerson throughout the book, because daddy Emerson would have come out on top in that battle… sorry Maggie.
Loved seeing the change in Maggie though, she was so confident and sure of herself by the epilogue. We love a women in charge.
Definitely recommend this as well as the entire series. So good.

5/5 🌶️

When Sara first released the tropes for Mercy and had Maggie in a reverse age gap relationship, I wondered if it might have been Beau. I hated him so much during most of Praise, but he really came around at the end and I wanted to see his redemption. Boy, it did not disappoint. Beau was the perfect brat, spoiled his whole life, with arrogance for miles. Maggie was a gem as a Domme. When she finally shed her shame and stepped into the role, it was incredible.

I loved that this one was a little darker than the others in the series. Nothing is better than watching a broken boy heal and Beau ""was never whole to begin with"". He took a lot of his anger out on Emerson for a long time, but we finally get to see where all that anger comes from and how Maggie helps him deal with it. There was one point where he blew up at her and it was such a sad, but (eventually) beautiful moment. He needs the control she offers.

The clim@x was really unexpected to me. I'll leave it at that, I don't want to give up any spoilers. I love how it all played out in the end, even giving Beau's mom a chance at some redemption.

This story was absolute fire. Hot Hot Hot. I never imagined liking a reverse age gap or a Domme book, but somehow Sara always seems to make me believe any kïnk could be mine. I loved this relationship so much. The emotion that went into it really made the BDSM that much sęxïer. And it was great getting to see the punishment/brat side of Dom/sub relationships after the praise/good girl side we got to see in Praise.

Really happy that this isn't the end of SPC. I absolutely can't wait for more.",positive
116,Kindle Store,Verity,$11.99,4,"Verity opens with author Lowen Ashleigh having a very bad morning. Her mother died the previous week after a year-long battle with colon cancer. Lowen had a difficult relationship with her mother -- ""a direct result of my own mother being terrified of me,"" she relates -- but still brought her to Lowen's apartment and cared for her during the last nine months of her life. Lowen is a sleepwalker and her mother kept her fairly secluded as a child, afraid of what Lowen might be capable of doing during one of many sleepwalking episodes. Now she has left her apartment in New York City for the first time in weeks, summoned to a meeting at her publisher's office by her literary agent, Corey, with whom she was previously in an intimate relationship. Just as Lowen is waiting for a crosswalk light to change, a man steps into the street and is struck by a truck. Lowen is understandably shaken, and the man's blood is splattered on her face and white shirt.

A handsome stranger escorts her into a coffee shop bathroom and literally gives her the shirt off his back. They chat briefly, and Loewn concludes that he ""wants to be invisible in this city. Just like me."" After all, she moved to New York to become part of the city's invisible millions of invisible residents. Her books have not sold well enough for her publisher to offer her another contract unless she agrees to promote them, something she has refused to do in the past. ""I'm so awkward I'm afraid once my readers meet me in person, they'll swear off my books forever,"" Lowen laments. ""That's why I stay home and write. I think the idea of me is better than the reality of me."" But another contract was her last hope. She took time off from her writing career believing that her mother would leave her some money. Now, having lived off the advance she received after signing her prior contract, she has learned that she will receive nothing from her mother's estate. And be homeless soon, unless she receives a job offer.

When Lowen arrives at her publisher's office, she is shocked to find the man whose shirt she is wearing is attending the same meeting. He is Jeremy Crawford, husband of Verity, a very successful author who is unable to complete the series of books she was writing. Lowen is being offered a flat fee of seventy-five thousand dollars per book to write the last three volumes in the series, with the first installment due in six months. Lowen is determined to turn down the offer until Jeremy informs her that he selected her because Verity read one of Lowen's books and it was among her favorites. She purportedly told Jeremy that they shared a similar writing style and Lowen was destined to be ""the next big thing."" Verity has been catastrophically injured in a motor vehicle accident, following the deaths of both of her daughters, Chastin and Harper, leaving Jeremy to raise their young son, Crew, alone. Lowen ultimately agrees to take on the project.

Lowen makes the six-hour drive to the Crawford home in Vermont, listening to the audio version of the first book in the series en route. She is to spend time in Verity's office, reviewing the research and notes she left there in order to assess how best to approach writing the next book. Lowen meets Crew and learns that Verity's condition is extremely serious. She is in a virtually catatonic state -- uncommunicative and unable to care for herself. Caregivers spend the day in the home, with Jeremy managing at night. Lowen soon discovers that Verity's office lacks organization -- her expansive desk is strewn with stacks from end to end with papers and files, and boxes containing more documents line the walls. Clearly, the process of sorting through it all will take much longer than Lowen originally anticipated. As she begins reading Verity's second book, she realizes the ""books are from the villain's point of view"" and she will need ""time to work myself into that mindset while writing."" Jeremy claims that he has never read Verity's books because he ""didn't like being inside her head.""

Author Colleen Hoover recounts Lowen's story via a first-person narrative, with the story really taking off as Lowen attempts to settles into the Crawford home. She is keenly observant and inquisitive about Verity's writing, as well as her family, and quickly finds herself attracted to Jeremy, who is still married to the incapacitated woman being cared for in an upstairs bedroom. Searching through Verity's office, Lowen stumbles upon a manuscript entitled ""So Be It."" Verity hopes it is an outline for the next book, but it is instead an autobiography drafted by Verity. Reading it is not what she has been hired to do, but she justifies her insatiable curiosity by construing her review of the manuscript as research. ""I need to see how Verity's mind works to understand her as a writer."" Soon she is absorbed in Verity's descriptions of meeting Jeremy, the development of their relationship and the early days of their marriage, as well as her pregnancies and motherhood. The more she reads, the more frightened of Verity Lowen becomes, especially when events she observes appear to be inconsistent with what she has been told about Verity's condition. Nonetheless, Lowen continues returning to the manuscript to better understand the Crawford family's history, and gain insight into Jeremy and Verity's marriage. But Lowen is playing a dangerous game. Verity's purported autobiography is a dark and disturbing confession of Verity's feelings, motivations, and unspeakably vile acts. Lowen believes the manuscript to be an accurate depiction of Verity's life, and concludes that it ""was written by a very disturbed woman -- a woman whose house I currently inhabit.""

Hoover ramps up the tension as Lowen becomes entangled in a budding relationship with Jeremy, influenced heavily by what she is reading in the manuscript. Verity's revelations are horrifying, and as Lowen and Jeremy grow closer, he increasingly opens up to her, sharing details of his life with Verity about which Lowen feigns ignorance. Lowen's suspicions about the accident in which Verity was injured grow. Is Jeremy being completely honest with Lowen? Why is he willing to embark on a new relationship with Lowen when his wife, although injured, is still alive? He claims that he cannot move Verity to a care facility because Crew cannot sustain another loss. While Verity is cared for in their home, Crew can spend unlimited amounts of time at her bedside. Lowen now possesses detailed information about the deaths of Jeremy's daughters. Were their deaths really tragic accidents? Is Crew safe?

Hoover's characters are both fascinating and infuriating. The story is related solely from Lowen's perspective. Her childhood was difficult because of her sleepwalking and the way it detrimentally impacted her relationship with her mother. She has achieved modest success as a writer, but because of her discomfort in social situations, her career growth has been stymied. She accepts the offer to write Verity's next three books because she desperately needs the money, but also because it is an opportunity too good to pass up. But she is confused not only by her burgeoning attraction to Jeremy, but the incongruity between what she has been told about Verity's accident and what transpires in the house. Of course, Lowen's feelings and experiences are colored by the information set forth in the manuscript. Interestingly, Hoover has said that even when she depicts Lowen reading Verity's manuscript, readers are ""still not fully in Verity’s head because we’re always in Lowen’s perspective, reading something she found. When I write a book from one character’s point of view, I rarely think about the story from the other character’s perspectives. Sometimes it’s necessary for certain scenes, but with this book, it was important for me to feel the confusion and fear Lowen felt. So as the author, I had to be completely blind to what was happening from everyone else's perspectives."" Still, as the story progresses, Hoover keeps readers guessing as to how gullible and vulnerable Lowen really is. She believes the manuscript is truthful and accurate, and that Jeremy is not the villain -- if, in fact there is a villain in the Crawfords' story. But could Lowen possibly be opportunistic, calculating, and willing to do anything to be with Jeremy?

Jeremy is equally captivating. He is handsome, charming, successful, and by all outward appearances, a family man who has sustained unimaginable losses who has been able to soldier on only because he has a young son to raise. To be fair, although Verity's prognosis is never affirmatively established, his desire to move on with his life is understandable -- Verity sustained a serious head injury which will, in all likelihood, preclude her from resuming a fully normal life. But was his meeting with Lowen on the street just before the meeting at her publisher's office really just coincidental? Did he intend for her to find the manuscript in Verity's office? Has he been fully aware of its contents all along? About that, Hoover says, ""I’m not sure because I was never in Jeremy’s head."" In other words, readers can draw their own conclusions, based on the evidence Hoover does present.

And what about Verity? Is she selfishly conniving and evil, as the manuscript suggests? Or is she a blameless grieving mother who was tragically injured in a horrific car accident?

The manuscript provides myriad complications. Lowen debates whether she should discuss it with Jeremy. She doesn't believe he is aware of its existence or content. He claimed he never read Verity's books, after all. Lowen learns that Verity was injured when her vehicle hit a tree, but there were no skidmarks on the pavement. She concludes Verity ""either fell asleep or she did it on purpose."" Does it matter to Lowen which scenario is accurate? What conclusion has Jeremy drawn about the cause of the accident?

Putting aside the perspective from which the story is told, no aspect of the story or the characters can be accepted at face value. Hoover includes plot twists so shocking and unnerving that Verity, originally published in 2018, continues to be one of the most-discussed psychological thrillers ever written. (There is even a Facebook discussion group devoted to the book, boasting nearly twenty-five thousand members!) The book is fast-paced, engrossing, and extremely entertaining. The story's pace gradually accelerates with each surprising development and breath-taking revelations of the truth or, perhaps, a manipulated version of the truth. The tale careens to a jaw-dropping conclusion that will keep readers thinking, discussing, and debating Hoover's extremely clever and nuanced tale, as well as her deliciously intriguing and morally ambiguous characters (who may prove themselves to be not as ambiguous as originally thought) for a very, very long time. Hoover says she ""chose the ending because it’s frightening to me. It’s my biggest nightmare For the darkness in the worlds I create as a writer to somehow"" intrude into her real life.

This book had me hooked from the moment I opened the book and read the first sentence I was like oh hell what do you all have me reading.
Now Triller books are not my cup of tea, I am a big old scary cat, and I just do not like things that are scary of things that could happen. So, when I was Listing to this book while at work, I was like Oh how am I going to be able to do my work and read this book. I really did not know what to expect when reading this book because I did not know how triller books flow, but I learned the day I picked this here book up.
Now I am not going to go into super detail about this book because it would give it away and I really want you to read this book. This book is very beautifully written and when I tell you Ms. Hoover did not leave a single thing out this book. She came with all the things. If they ever make this book a movie it “BETTER BE JUST LIKE THE BOOK” do not leave a single thing out. The ending of this book had my mouth on the floor for about five minutes. I was like I know good and well you do not end this book like that. I was shaking! Like I did not see that ending at all.
Verity is about an author named Lowen who was hired to step in and help finish writing Verity’s Murderous book series after she was in a bad accident and is unable to finish off her series. Lowen took a trip to Verity’s home so that she could pick up somethings and get to know Verity’s style of writing when she found an Autobiography that verity wrote. Now in the autobiography there are some chilling incidents that have been happing around the home while Verity was upstairs Bedridden in her room or was, she?
Now I gave this book 5 stars, it was the writing for me. I was hooked on this book and really could not stop reading it. This book is one of them books that when you start it you do not want to put it down. And after you finish it, you want to read it again so you can sit and think like dang I really did not see any of this coming. Now if you want to get into the world of Colleen Hoover writing I would highly recommend this not be the first book you start with, because after reading this book you are not going to want to read another book by her that is not a triller. If you read this book, what did you think of it? Would you recommend it to any of your family or friends?",positive
118,Kindle Store,Verity,$11.99,5,"When I first started reading this book, I really was not a fan of the writing style. The short sentences, the blocky style - it made it hard for my brain to read it naturally. I slowly began to realize that’s because that was the style of the emotion of the character at the time. Progressively through the book it became more seamless (though still a tad short here and there to my preferences). But I would be lying if I said this book didn’t have me on the edge of my seat a few times and genuine shocks more times than I can count. I laid down for bed at 10pm after having stopped the night before at page 36 - It’s now 1:30am as I write this review having just finished it. I’m shaking. I wasn’t ready for intensely intrigued I was going to become with this book. Wonderful story and insane ending, truly.

I would say it’s definitely more of a thriller suspense with a good bit of steamy romance.

In the beginning the romance was also a bit too in the face in my opinion, but like the sentence structure that calmed some as it continued.

Overall, I will keep this physical copy as one to add to my bookshelf. I don’t think I’ll reread it as it won’t have that same magic -/ the first time - but I wouldn’t be surprised if I did so in boredom in a decade or so to come. That is why 4 stars instead of 5. The fact I couldn’t readily reread it now + the irritating sentence structure and in the face silly romance. Though I digress, it is a young adult novel so I can see how it makes sense in its genre. I’ll definitely be suggesting it to people though

Edit:// I came back to give It five stars because I have thought about this book multiple times since finishing it and honestly would reread it. I know the twists wouldn’t be as dramatic but I want to reread it and pick up on new ideas and dive deeper into the connections. Damn - it was a good book. The first half had me almost putting it down but I am so glad I didn’t.",positive
119,Kindle Store,Verity,$11.99,3,"This was a tough book to rate as I wasn’t very fond with the ending. The book starts with sudden excitement. While walking to an important meeting, the protagonist Lowen is witness to a horrific car-pedestrian accident and left covered in blood. Another bystander swoops in to get her off the street and into a bathroom to clean her up. After that is done she still has time to get to her meeting across the street. While she is riding up the elevator that chivalrous man gets on and they find out they are going to the same meeting..

Lowen is a little known struggling author who is barely making ends meet. She is hoping this meeting is about another book offer. At the meeting, she finds out that the man who helped her clean up previously is named Jeremy and he is the husband of Verity Crawford. Verity is a very successful and highly respected author. Verity has been in an accident and cannot finish a highly popular series she has authored. Lowen is offered the chance to finish writing the series as a “co-author”. Due to the accident, at the present moment Verity isn’t able to communicate in any way. Although Lowen doesn’t want to do this she is persuaded by the charismatic Jeremy to take the job. To complete this series she has to go to the Crawfords residence and scour Verity’s notes and files to be able to successfully finish the series.

When Lowen arrives and starts digging through the files she discovers an unpublished and secret autobiography by Verity Crawford. She starts reading it thinking it will give her some insight into how the author thinks. When she starts reading the manuscript her new world is turned upside down with the revelations that are revealed.

Minor spoilers:
It’s funny, today when I finish this book I happen to have read an article about a new Game of Thrones spinoff. The creator of it was worried that so many of the original GOT fans are still furious of the finale of GOT that they will not watch it. This is relevant to the story as this may be one of the worst endings I have read to what I had would describe as an amazingly fast-paced read… The way it ends seems so improbable. But on top of that it leaves several other pieces mentioned earlier in the story unresolved. For example, early on we are led to believe that it was Verity’s choice to have a Lowen finish the book. Obviously that is not true but after a while Jeremy admits it was him all along who wanted her. This leads you to believe that Jeremy had more knowledge or some kind of background that we are not aware of. Jeremy and Lowen get close but Lowen has reason to believe that Verity is not only psychopathic but also faking her injuries…

Big spoiler:
After finishing this manuscript and learning how Verdi is a monster. We also find that she is faking the injury. At the end of the book we find out that this manuscript was a work of fiction and none of the things were real. If this is to be believed then Lowen helped Jermey commit a very serious crime. We are also left with the possibility that since verity is possibly a manipulative psychopath that this revealed a letter claiming the manuscript was fiction was fake.

My final assessment is this was a fast read that kept me very interested but I was very disappointed with the ending.",fair

Steam Level: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 (very descriptive/erotic sex scenes)
Trigger Warning: death of a parent, death of a child, murder, attempted self-abortion, child abuse & neglect, spouse with brain damage

Lowen Ashleigh is still reeling from the death of her mother and then finding out she's about to be evicted. Then she gets an incredible job offer- to finish writing a book series by famous author Verity Crawford. Verity is unable to finish the last three books in the series after a car accident has left her brain damaged and unable to care for herself. Verity's husband, Jeremy, allows Lowen to stay in their home while she sorts through Verity's book notes. It's there that Lowen comes across a manuscript for Verity's autobiography. As she reads, she learns disturbing truths about the Crawford family. Lowen also begins to develop feelings for Jeremy, despite the fact that he's still married. Will Lowen be able to handle the truths revealed in Verity's manuscript, and will she be able to resist the magnetic pull she feels with Jeremy?

I'm pretty sure there were many people concerned about my mental health when they saw I was going to read this book. I had so many warnings going into it. Well, I'm here to say that I finished it and survived! If you read the trigger warnings, then you'll see that this has some really sad and disturbing content. Verity's manuscript is basically the journal of a psychopath. And the details about her sex life with Jeremy are frequent, detailed, and obsessive. There's also a bit of a horror theme going on throughout this book, and I quickly figured out one of the mysteries that would be revealed at the end. I honestly wasn't prepared for the infamous letter, though! I had to shut the book and try to wrap my head around that twist. I still don't know what is true and what's a lie. I do feel like there were a few other things left unexplained: the sleepwalking, the shady nurse, and Crew's two knife ""accidents."" I guess I just have to make up my own reasoning for those things. While I certainly won't be rereading this one, it did have me hooked and is perfect for anyone wanting a creepy look into the mind and life of a very deranged individual.",positive
121,Kindle Store,Verity,$11.99,5,"I’ve always held off on reading Colleen Hoover’s books. One of the first things I’ve always heard about her books is how they broke someone’s heart while reading and they were never the same afterwards. That sounded slightly terrifying, so I just held off on reading them.
Well I’ve finally given in and I read Verity….WHAT A MIND EF THAT WAS.
I honestly really enjoyed it. I was immediately drawn in and had to see what would happen next to Lo. I loved trying to guess what was really going on (I was somewhat right).
That ending though…I loved that it left me wondering and being able to talk to other about their thoughts and opinions.

You should hate me for telling you to read it. You should read it in print so you can throw it at the wall without breaking your phone. I'm angry. I'm devastated. I'm in awe of Hoover's talent.

There were some parts that bothered me. The suggested violence toward the children made me cry. But it still was a very good book. I don't agree with alot of the negative reviews. But that's ok because we are all different people.
Out of all that I've read so far, this one by Collen had more sexual content than any of the others that I've read. She did not hold back in her descriptions. It was a thriller with twist and turns, some of which I expected and some not. But I could not put it down. I love the way she describes life as a writer. I love that you don't expect the same technique of writing with each of her books because they all are different. There was one part that I absolutely didn't like and wish she would have written differently but it doesn't make me hate the book. I didn't love the ending, yet it was a big part of the whole story. I think the letter was just part of her manipulation. You'll see what I mean after you read it. :-)

He’s sweet to her and only her and I’m so here for it! I loved seeing them fall in love.

136,Kindle Store,Regretting You,$5.99,4,"I won't lie. I did enjoy this book, but it has definitely been my least favorite CoHo book so far. It was a good story with a decent twist about a seemingly perfect family destroyed in the span of a night. Morgan and Chris have the seemingly perfect life, with daughter Clara in tow. They are bound and determined to make sure Clara never repeats the mistakes they made when they were her age. Then, one night, Morgan gets a call saying that Chris has been in an accident and has been taken to the hospital. She immediately rushes there. When she gets there, Jonah (her and Chris's friend), arrives soon after. She then questions how he even knew about the wreck, and he says ""What are you talking about, Morgan? I am here because I was called and told that Jenny (his wife and Morgan's sister) had been in a wreck."" This takes the story into the spiral of ""why were our significant others together, when Jenny told us the night before that she had been at work"". They end up finding out that they had been headed to stay at a hotel together that day when they were in the wreck. Jenny and Chris both die as a result of the wreck. When Jonah and Morgan find out that they had been sneaking around behind their backs, they are crushed. Morgan takes refuge in the arms of Jonah, the man who she has always loved, and who she would have probably married instead of Chris, had they not gotten pregnant with Clara first. When Clara sees Morgan and Jonah kissing one night, she is immediately angry. She then finds out the truth of the situation and comes to accept their new relationship. While all this is happening, Clara has a budding romance with Miller Adams. He has been in love with her for years now, but has kept it hidden. The whole time, Clara has thought he hated her because of the way he avoided her. When they finally get together though, they fall so deeply in love and he helps her through the stuff with her family. Again, overall good family book, but just didn't blow me away like all of her other novels have. Can't wait to read my next novel by her!",positive
137,Kindle Store,Regretting You,$5.99,4,"Ok, overall I thought it was a good story. I liked the back and forth perspective from both the mother & daughter dealing with loss, betrayal, and questioning love… the story tore my heart a few times and I just felt so much need for this to end up with the happiest ending ever to even it out. But like many of Colleen’s books, the ending is a bit rushed and doesn’t give me full closure from the complete bloody massacre the earlier chapters had on my feels…

SPOILER WARNING!!!!

People might disagree with me, but Morgan needed to open those letters her husband had from her sister. She needed to know the true extent of the affair. Was it just sexual? Were they in love? How long had it gone on? Were there feelings of guilt? Did they try to stop?….I’m trying to wrap my head around the author’s premise that she was stronger now and didn’t need to know what had happened. Umm, I call bulls**t.
Developing the character from someone who was oblivious to things and was walked all over by everyone close to her doesn’t mean she hides from the truth and is too afraid to open those letters and just decides to move on. Nope. Nope. That’s a case of denial, not strength. True character strength/growth would be her willing to know the truth and THEN saying—it can’t hurt me, they can’t hurt me anymore, and then go embrace a new start.
You realize about 30% into the book that this woman needs some major therapy, but she hides. If Morgan was my friend, I’d smack her upside the head, shake her and tell her that at some point in her life she needs to stop avoiding the truth/pain. Embrace the scars of what people did to you to truly become someone who is a survivor. Someone who can say—this is what really happened, the whole ugly truth, and not only didn’t it break me, but I’m happier now than ever. I hope if there are real women who read this book who are living this situation in life—they don’t follow this example.",positive
138,Kindle Store,Regretting You,$5.99,5,"I definitely feel like this is one of Colleen's underrated books, I'll be honest I didn't expect much out of it (idky I just didn't), but let me just say I loved it. I feel like Morgan was trying so hard to keep the awful truth from her daughter, Clara, so she wouldn't think differently of her Dad and Aunt. All Morgan wanted to do was keep her daughter from hurting, and to keep her from making the same mistakes that she did at her age. For that I did not like Clara, I felt like she wasn't trying to be understanding of her mother and was being a real brat but I guess that's what its like to be 16. Despite her mother's initial thoughts, Miller was good for Clara, he was there for her even when she was acting like a brat (trying to keep it PG) not only to her mother but also to him. Miller didn't deserve that, but he understood her grief. Now, don't even get me started on Morgan and Jonah because OMG I am so happy that through everything they been through, they were able to end up together. 💛",positive
139,Kindle Store,Regretting You,$5.99,4,"Okay so loved the book, as usual, but seriously the whole time in my head I was screaming at both main characters to JUST FREAKING TELL HER. It’s dumb. If my ex had cheated and I found out, I would 100% have saved myself all that fighting and drama and just freaking told. HOWEVER, I did like the rest of the book. I like the sense of humor used with Miller. I like that they had some deep routed issues and were not perfect people.",positive
140,Kindle Store,Regretting You,$5.99,4,"When my favorite authors have new books that come out, I try my best to go in as blind as I can. No reading the blurb. Skipping over reviews online and teasers in book groups. It's hard, but I want to experience the book without ANY preconceived notions and be surprised on my own. Regretting You was a beautiful surprise from an author that can write absolutely anything (but what is up with her use of letters in so many books?? lol).

Regretting You is told in dual POV from a mother (Morgan) and daughter (Clara). They've experienced something that was life altering and the experience changed them and their whole life forever.

""Right after something tragic happens, you feel like you've fallen off a cliff. But after the tragedy starts to sink in, you realize you didn't fall off a cliff. You're on an eternal roller coaster that just reached the bottom. Now it's gonna be up and down and upside down for a long , long time. Maybe even forever.""

And that's what this story was for me. It unfolded and we got to see how 2 characters handled the situation. Neither one was perfect. A mother trying to shield her daughter and protect her, while at the same time trying to forge and fix the relationship between them that had floundered in recent years. Morgan gave up absolutely everything for Clara and, being a teen, she never saw it. Morgan was selfless and that was her biggest flaw. She did for others at the detriment to herself.
And then there's Clara. She is a teenager and that's almost the only thing we need to say to understand her actions. She is trying to navigate a new life and holds so much hatred toward her mother that just wants a relationship with her. But she also has a boy around her that intrigues her (Miller, FTW). Her actions are all over the place. These three characters and their roller coaster of emotions had me feeling for them all throughout the book.

I hate a review that gives me a synopsis of a book. So I will leave you with this...
Regretting You gives you two female characters that are trying to figure out their places in life and their places with each other. It's not easy to read everything and you will want to smack Clara a few times. But like I said, she's a teenager that's been dealt a blow. And even Morgan is frustrating. Especially in the flashbacks where maybe she got it wrong.
Miller is utter perfection. Seriously. His actions and the way he handled all his situations was very commendable. Just remember that they are teens, and not everything is perfect.
And then there is Gramps. I love an old character that comes in funny or with some major sage advice. He was really a favorite of mine.
Then we have Jonah, Chris and Jenny. They are all major players in this story, but this is Morgan and Clara's journey and that's where the focus lies. Don't expect answers from them. ;)

Regretting You was a journey for two characters and while I wanted information from other characters, it wasn't their story. The way the characters interacted, the story flowed from past to present and from character to character was done so well. The plot moved at a pace that worked for the story being told. Of course I wanted more answers, but I was understanding of this mother/ daughter relationship that included their own personal relationships and how they navigated them. Colleen Hoover wrote a book that a mother could share with their high school daughter and hopefully bring them closer. While it's not my favorite CoHo book, it is still a book that I will love to share with others. It's beautiful and well told. The message about relationships and attraction really hit home.

""Attraction isn't something that only happens once, with one person. It's part of what drives humans. Our attraction to each other, to art, to food, to entertainment. Attraction is fun. So when you decide to commit to someone, you aren't saying, 'I promise I'll never be attracted to anyone else.' You're saying, 'I promise to commit to you, despite my potential future attraction to other people.'...Relationships are hard for that very reason.""

Colleen has a way with words and is gifting us with another book that details the flaws in humans and how we can react to them and process them. Be prepared to feel and learn all at once. Loving and hating the characters in this story will be a journey in itself. 4.5 stars",positive

Tracy continues to work cold cases, dedicated to solving past crimes and giving families some much needed closure, while enabling her to find a work/life balance that allows her to spend quality time with both her husband Dan and daughter Daniella. One case in particular--A 25 year old missing person case--falls in Tracy’s lap, but unraveling all the threads only leads to complicated questions with potentially disconcerting answers.

There is a back story to all that transpires in “What She Found,” introduced via this author’s latest novella entitled, “The Last Line.” Coincidentally, I had just finished reading “The Last Line” prior to delving between the pages of this new Tracy Crosswhite novel. At the time, I had no idea that these two stories were connected, but it certainly helped to further my enjoyment by filling in all the subtle gaps between the present and the past.",positive

156,Kindle Store,The Guilty Husband: An utterly gripping psychological thriller with a jaw-dropping twist!,$2.99,4,"A domestic suspense that had the right elements to attract this reviewer!

We all know the story. A man cheats. The woman he was having an affair with is found murdered. The husband becomes the main suspect.

Did he do it?

Vince Taylor had everything. He is the CEO of Kitztech, a successful tech company responsible for famous apps. He is married to his beautiful and lovely wife, Nicole. Then a new intern, Layla begins working for his company. He becomes entangled with Layla and when he decides to break things up with her, she is found dead in Central Park. Cause of death: blunt head trauma.

The cops, Detective Allison Barnes and detective Jack Lanner come knocking asking questions and all clues point to Vince as the prime suspect. They just have to prove it.

I did not feel any empathy toward Vince. After all, he had a good life and decided to throw it all away by cheating. He made his bed and now he had to lay in it. I wanted detective Barnes to get him for his lies. His wife deserved better!

Stephanie DeCarolis's debut novel was told from multiple POVs and had different timelines. The Guilty Husband was a fast-paced, addicting suspense novel that had me listening whenever I could. I do have to admit that I knew the ending from the very beginning but despite guessing it, I enjoyed the deliverance.

166,Kindle Store,It Ends with Us: A Novel,$9.99,4,"So much hype over this book! I've read dozens and dozens of KU Romances across every genre - billionaire, mafia, same sex, enemies to lovers, second chance, dark, light, everything in between. There is some really good content over there so I finally wanted to see how they compared to one of the best selling romance novels of all time. Selfishly I also wanted to see how Hoover's writing (this is my first of hers i've read) compared to Sylvia Day whose Bared series I loved Books 1-3.

Overall I give this a 4 stars. It didn't completely bowl me over but overall really good. One little admission is that I totally skipped the pages and pages and pages of ""journal entries"" aka back story for Lily and Atlas, and guess what? Still was able to figure out the story just fine :) It came across to me as filler and really slowed the plot down but I know some readers love those juicy details. I just wanted to get back to the main story line and honestly some of the entries were like 12 pages long. If you wanna do the same, I won't tell anybody and I promise you won't be lost.

Spoilers ahead.
This book honestly wasn't as dark as I thought it would be given all the talk of domestic violence. I thought it would be scene after scene, but there were only 3 incidents in the whole book, 2 of which were somewhat unintentional and/or partially happenstance, while the third was just nauseatingly purposeful. Some of the MC (Lily) reactions seemed a little fake or contrived, and especially I DID not like it when she informed Ryle WHILE HE HELD HIS NEWBORN BABY that she wanted a divorce. Surely she could have waited a day? I don't like when books make me dislike a protagonist and up until this very point at the end, I had really liked Lily.

Ryle and his thought processes were right on. Having experience with men with major emotional trauma this really hit home for me and seemed incredibly realistic. There are two types of abusers in my opinion - the ones who are truly mean and don't care that they are hurting others and the the ones with the demons they can't control. Him putting on Lily by saying ""help me"" as though its up to her to heal him was really on point (if very, very wrong - he is responsible for his own healing).

Anyway, overall pretty well done if a little too much filler in the middle of the book. The ending was pretty superb and that Epilogue! I have to admit I was rooting for Atlas the whole time, but I have a weak spot for rescuers. Unfortunately I didn't really get invested in any of the characters enough to want to spend the money or time on It Starts with Us, which starts where EWU leaves off. I think I'll move on to Ugly Love which I heard was steamier and is a little more along my preference lines.

TBH if you are looking for pure drama and emotional angst Sylvia Day's Book 1 of Bared series is going to leave you gasping, its way more fast paced. Unfortunately though the series drops off in quality after book 3, and one thing CoHo fans love is her consistency.

HTH!",positive
167,Kindle Store,It Ends with Us: A Novel,$9.99,5,"This book.... OHHH my gosh. This book was so heart-wrenching, yet so beautiful at the same time. Coming from someone who has experienced domestic violence in the past it really hits home. When I first bought this book I didn't know what to except, but it wasn't this. It was everything I could've hoped for and MORE. I loved the way she portrayed Lily. She was so courageous, bold, relatable and perfect in all the right ways. I cannot wait for book 2!!! Once I finished, I couldn't stop crying for a whole hour straight. I can't even remember turning pages because it had me hooked that good!! READ IT READ IT READ IT!

*SPOILERS*]

First off, some of these reviews piss me off, especially the ones that are geared toward the main character Lily.

""Why did Colleen have her stay with someone who was constantly abusing her and treating her as so""?
""I was so pissed she got right with Atlas right after the whole thing with Ryle happened, that would not happen in real life...""

First off, if you have ever experienced domestic violence in your life you would know how hard it is to leave the situation. Second, did you even read the book? Lily clearly states her confusion with either staying or leaving. It's not like she was staying with him because she liked the abuse?! Some of yawl's reviews seriously get to me. Imagine falling in love with someone who was absolutely perfect in your eyes and treated you in all the ways you'd ever imagine. You then get tied down... He starts to abuse you... Does things to you that you never thought this man who loved you SO much could possibly do?!? But it happens. It's not that easy to up in leave... If you TRULY knew what it is like to experience domestic abuse you would know that. So please stop getting mad at Lily for taking so long to leave! The whole thing about her getting with Atlas so fast after the whole dealio with Ryle ended, was PERFECT in my eyes. People are getting mad at how quickly she got back with him, but he was her safe place and FIRST true love (who matter-of-fact she never fell out of love with). I would've done the exact same dang thing!",positive
168,Kindle Store,It Ends with Us: A Novel,$9.99,5,"I have never been inspired to write a book review. This is my first. I read all the critical reviews, but the subject matter of this book hit a very sensitive nerve for me. First of all, for those who thought the book was too sensual or too emotional, I must venture a guess this subject matter is something they have never lived or even thought was possible.
Domestic abuse has many sides and many questions. If you have not been a victim, it might be easy to say,”Why didn’t you leave?” This book answers many questions and explores the victims and abusers viewpoints. The most prominent quotation in this book for me is, “There are no bad people, only people who do bad things.” I believe the circumstances of our childhoods shape us into the adults we become, even more than genetics. The traumas we have to survive and the way we are made to feel about ourselves stay with us.
I was a survivor of my parents abuse of each other. It was not just my father, but also my mother who fought violently with each other. I was able to go to university and leave the trauma physically, but not emotionally.
I married the first man who proposed so I didn’t have to go home.
I withstood his verbal and physical abuse for 28 years. He stopped hurting me before my bruises and choking so as not to send me to the hospital. I stayed with him for 28 years because he was a good father and my daughters loved him.
I loved him because when he was good, he was very good. Was I stupid? Was I afraid to go out on my own? Yes. My children came first. I would endure anything for their safety and happiness.
This amazing book addresses both sides of abuse, from each perspective. The heartbreak of having to decide your future with a man you love with all your heart, who loves you with everything he has in him, but who also has demons he is unable to control.
Please read this book. It will give you sight into this ongoing tragedy between men and women. Withhold your judgment until the end, if you have the wisdom to do so",positive
169,Kindle Store,It Ends with Us: A Novel,$9.99,4,"*Review originally posted on Goodreads*

'I wish cutting my feelings off for the person who hurt me was as easy as I used to think it would be. Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.'

It Ends With Us was beautifully complicated. It was hot and cold. Up and down. Good and bad. Beautiful and ugly... I'm still trying to figure out how I really feel about it all because I'm genuinely torn on how I want to perceive this storyline. I loved it but in all honesty, I really do think I hate it as well. Not the ""I-hate-you-Colleen-Hoover-stop-writing-books-and-find-a-different-career"" type of hate but rather ""I-hate-you-Colleen-Hoover-for-making-me-hate-everything-that-I-came-to-love"" kind of hate because it pretty much summarizes all my thoughts and feelings about It Ends With Us in one sentence.

My opinions were completely divided. One side of me, the hopeless romantic, was utterly unsatisfied and angry with the outcome of the story. The opposite side, the one that's all about women's empowerment, was cheering on #TeamLily like it was Independence Day.

Rather than trying to sugarcoat my thoughts, I'm just going to be completely honest. I was 100 percent team Ryle from the very first time we met him. Just like Lily, I fell in love with every word and every gesture that rolled off of his body. I. WAS. HOOKED. It also didn't help that I kept fantasizing Doctor Mike as Ryle Kincaid. *heart eyes emoji* I loved his ambition. His personality. His confidence. To be honest, I think I might've loved Ryle even more than Lily did but that's another story for another day. That more than likely explains why I took the second half of this book like a blow to the gut.

Once we got to the second half of the book, that's where it started going a bit downhill for me as a Ryle and Lily shipper. Every happy moment that ever happened between my ship came barreling down as it collided with pain and abuse. I was angry. I was thrashing. I was yelling at the pages in front of me, ""Why are you doing this Colleen?!"" But most importantly, I was just heartbroken to see such a beautiful couple become so toxic. Everything I loved about the first half of the book was slowly unraveling right before my very eyes as if it never really existed in the first place. I can't even remember how many times I wanted to put the book down because my hopeless romantic self just couldn't handle it anymore. But I just kept on reading because I was guiltily hoping that Ryle and Lily would still have their happy ending despite all that had happened. :/ Sadly, this was where I was torn the most.

I have the upmost respect for Lily. She is definitely one of my favorite female characters that Colleen has ever created because she did what a lot of us would've struggled to do in the end: walk away. Lily was such a strong character and I admire her so much for having the strength to stand up for herself. There were numerous times towards the end of the book where I knew I probably would've gave in and forgave Ryle for his actions but Lily was inflexible. She was in a tough position but she put her foot down and demanded better for herself. In the end, no matter if I ship Ryle/Lily or Atlas/Lily, I'm glad that Lily was able to find peace for her and Emmy.

As for Atlas, I liked him but I didn't love him. Definitely nowhere near my love for Ryle. I wasn't exactly rooting for Atlas but I wouldn't have minded if Lily chose him in the end. However, I still very much preferred Ryle regardless. I just felt that Atlas was the typical knight in shining armor. Typical good guy you run to. His background story was interesting but him as a character... not so much. He just felt so ordinary and predictable. I wanted to ship Atlas and Lily because let's face it, the signs were practically being shoved down our throats, and although the relationship between Ryle and Lily was developing, Atlas's presence was a like a thorn on your side you just couldn't shake off. But I just couldn't bring myself to ship them blindly like I did with Ryle and Lily.

Unfortunately, I was too far gone and too far in love with the idea of Ryle and Lily to make room for Atlas and because of that, I'm not sure if I'll ever be fully satisfied with that ending. I was happy that Lily was no longer a victim of domestic abuse. I'm glad that after all that happened between them, Lily and Ryle parted on good terms. I'll forever be heartbroken over the idea of what could've been. And I feel indifferent to Lily and Atlas. Sorry not sorry, Atlas. That basically sums up all my feelings in a nutshell.

To be honest, I was actually feeling a bit more bitter than I'm making it seem after that ending. But after reading the author's note, it really put things in perspective for me and made me look at the story with brand new eyes. I developed a new understanding and appreciation for the story behind the story.

I was dying for Ryle and Lily to have their happy ending. Until the very end, I was still rooting for them. It's such an ugly confession to make especially when the couple you're rooting for is toxic and abusive. And I think I feel this way because I never, and hopefully I never will, had to experience abuse. I don't know what it's like and what goes on in the minds of the abused. Colleen did such an excellent job at creating the perfectly imperfect man that was Ryle. Abuse in books has always been a trigger for me and if it were any other book I think I would've put this book down by the first incident of abuse. But Colleen just made you fall so deeply in love with a character that even you couldn't bring yourself to hate him even if you wanted to. YOU were the Lily of this story. But unfortunately, I don't think my Lily would've had the courage to leave. I really wish I could say that I would leave in an instant, but I think I would honestly be lying to myself. You can tell yourself that if you were in Lily's position you would leave in a blink of an eye, but things wouldn't be as easily said and done if you were the one who was actually experiencing it all. And in truth, I think this is exactly what Colleen wanted us to actually sit down and think about because victims who've experienced abuse wouldn't be rooting for Ryle and Lily. I wouldn't be rooting for Ryle and Lily. It just goes to show how much of a struggle it really is to walk away from someone you love and loves you back in all the wrong ways. I usually never read the author's notes after the book but I'm really glad I took the time to read Colleen's story. It really did make me see the situation from a different perspective.

I'd been having a bad CoHo streak for three books in a row (if you're curious, the books were — in order — Hopeless, November 9, and Too Late) and for a moment there I was beginning to think that I was doomed to never enjoy another book written by Colleen Hoover again. But PRAISE. It Ends With Us restored my faith completely in the CoHo hype. Not that I was ever planning NOT to read any more of Colleen's books! Colleen Hoover is 100 percent my favorite auto-buy author. I will always buy her books no matter if I end up loving them or not, and with good reason because Colleen is such an exceptional writer. It Ends With Us still wasn't able to top Ugly Love as my favorite CoHo book of all time but I really enjoyed this book more than I thought I would.",positive

It takes a lot of courage to do that, and the way this book’s plot developed was from a girl ready to accept the fate of the beaten house wife , but then she knew this isn’t what she was in Boston for .

172,Kindle Store,It Ends with Us: A Novel,$9.99,5,"Wow. As a regular reviewer of books, I very rarely read the synopsis of a book before reading it. I was taken completely off-guard with this one. I am probably one of the few who have never read one of her books although I've been hearing the hype for a while. So I started this one with an open mind, like I do most books I read, not knowing what to expect and letting the story take me where I needed to go. I noticed the normal things right away. Her writing style is very good, and the pace of the story is spot-on. I became completely invested by the middle of the story. I was in love with the characters and pulling for the main character and her future. And then, bam, I'm facing the dilemma Lily faces. Because I feel the exact same way she does, and her shock and indecision is mine. I won't tell you any more. Maybe you don't read the synopsis ahead of time either. But I will tell you that this is a book well-worth reading. And reading the Author's Notes afterward, simply said, sent me straight over the edge with recognition.

176,Kindle Store,One Moment Please: A Surprise Pregnancy Standalone (Wait With Me Book 3),$4.99,5,"With crackling chemistry and a sexy doctor you'll want to kiss one minute and smack the next, this accidental pregnancy romance hooked me in IMMEDIATELY. I always love strangers to lovers romances, and this adds an element of enemies to lovers that was pure delight. These two don't know anything about each other, but the sparks that fly between them are all kinds of HOT. Their first interactions are fiery fun, slowly simmering into something sweeter and more heartfelt. Our hero is in way over his head, and it was fun (and a little frustrating) to watch him heal his broken pieces. He's got a protective, possessive side that was super swoony, and he shows his affection through actions instead of words. It's another fantastic installment in a series that I've been slowly catching up on (backwards), and it left me ready to dive into the next one.

The story follows Lynsey, a woman who is both attracted to and a little infuriated by the temperamental doctor she keeps running into at the hospital cafeteria. On the day that she has a particularly memorable interaction with Josh, Lynsey has the unfortunate luck of being forced to talk to him at a bar. One thing leads to another, and the two feuding near-strangers have a hot and steamy night together. After disappearing at the end of the night, Lynsey believes she'll never see the man again... until she ends up in the ER, and he's the doctor on call. He's also the man who is tasked with letting Lynsey know that she's pregnant... with his baby. As if sleeping with the moody man wasn't bad enough, now Lynsey is stuck with him forever.

This really put me through my paces, emotionally. It's scorching one minute, playful the next, and then angsty when you least expect it. I loved that Lynsey and Josh were forced to connect and push through in moments when they would've otherwise given up, and their hard-won relationship felt sweeter because of it. I still kinda wanted to smack Josh sometimes, but I also adored his softer side. He's a man who doesn't know how to love - or is at least incredibly resistant to doing so - but he's a natural caretaker and truly loving deep down. Compartmentalizing his feelings as a doctor does not translate well to his personal life, and that causes plenty of conflict. However, the overall tone is light and sexy, with SO MUCH chemistry between these two. It reads easily as a standalone, but also makes a great addition to the series, and I'm kicking myself for not moving it up my TBR sooner.

Audio note: The audio is excellent! This one isn't duet narration like many of Daws' others, but it's the next best thing. I love both Erin Mallon and Teddy Hamilton, so it was no hardship to listen to them both. They both give emotive performances that seriously enhance the story, and it's such a good audio experience. The runtime is perfect for bingeing in one day, though I don't recommend this for the office. It's steamy from the start and stays that way throughout, with many fan-worthy moments that you won't want your co-workers overhearing, lol! The vibe works very well in audio though, with much of the story remaining light. I had a great time listening to this one, and it's got me ready to one-click the others in the series.",positive
177,Kindle Store,One Moment Please: A Surprise Pregnancy Standalone (Wait With Me Book 3),$4.99,4,"Lynsey Jones has found the perfect spot to write her thesis: the hospital cafeteria. She likes the vibe of the place and it has pie! She can't help noticing the hunky, arrogant jerk who frequents the place, ""Dr. Dick"". She's been happy just ogling him and is quite  surprised when he confronts her and accuses her of ""being weird"" for hanging out at the place. The meeting doesn't go well (there's some pie dropped on some male crotch) but Lynsey has no intention of ever going back there anyway as she has literally just finished writing her thesis. Fast forward to a few weeks later and they meet up again by chance at a bar. A few drinks, a couple of hours of heated banter, a shared Uber ride and months of mutual attraction and they find themselves in one very hot one night stand. 

Three months later, Lynsey is at the ER at the hospital to get some stitches after one of the several freak accidents she seems to be prone to and she's not only treated by Dr. Dick but he also informs her that the routine tests run at the ER show she's pregnant! And yeah, crap, the baby is his!

This is a very low angsty, grumpy/sunshine, one night stand, surprise baby, forced proximity rom com with all the goodness that Amy Daws always brings. It's fun to see those two banter like two little kids at kindergarten recess - Josh can't seem to be able to resist pulling at Lynsey's pigtails and she gives as good as she gets. 

Fun and lighthearted while touching on some heavy topics. Great read!

Lynsey and Josh (aka Dr. Dick) are so cute and their relationship gave me all the feels. Their ""meet cute"" in the hospital cafeteria was hilarious. I love their grumpy, sunshine dynamic with a dash of enemies to lovers vibes. Their volatile introduction leads to a steamy (spanking anyone? 😜) one night stand. A few months later our duo finally meet back up and are confronted with a huge surprise. They try to work together, figure things out, but some extra baggage from Josh keeps them working twice as hard. With some fun and meddling friends they'll get through it all eventually.

184,Kindle Store,One Moment Please: A Surprise Pregnancy Standalone (Wait With Me Book 3),$4.99,4,"I think I started this book and quit about five times before I finally committed to finishing it. I kept seeing ads and blurbs that looked interesting, so I would pick it up again but just couldn’t get past the beginning. Dr Dic k was just so over the top that I couldn’t make myself continue.

The main characters meet in a hospital cafeteria, where Lynsey and Josh (aka Dr Dic k) were both eating. Lynsey is working on her masters thesis, and finds it easier to work in the hospital cafeteria. For some reason, Dr Dic k feels it acceptable to confront her and call her all sorts of names for spending what he determines to be too much time in a hospital cafeteria. He belittles her, calls her insane, and threatens to call security for her being there. The fact that she’s eating the pie he wanted was seemingly a huge deal to him. As a healthcare worker, the scenario bothered me. I would rather him have been annoyed that she ate his pie, or maybe that she got his pie multiple days. But to belittle her and call her names and threaten security simply because he noticed she sat in the cafeteria a lot was ridiculous. For all he knows, she had a family member that has been there for sometime. As an ER doctor, he would not know every inpatient admission. So completely over the top and unprofessional.

After the explosion in the cafeteria, they meet up again at a bar with mutual friends. He again earned his nickname by being a complete jerk. Not even just a jerk, but ridiculously over the top. Somehow, we are led to believe that even after someone belittles her, and her profession, she would choose to go home with them for a one night stand. I never made it past this point the first five times, as I just found it so impossible that someone could be so disgusting to me, and I would find myself still somehow attracted to them.

Once I managed to move past this point, the book is far more enjoyable. Lynsey finds herself in the ER after a horrible tinder date gone wrong, and he is the one to tell her she’s pregnant. I love the support from her friends, including her male BFF Dean. I love that even though Josh repeatedly suggested she move in with him, she resisted. She made him work a little at getting to know each other, as she should. There were a few more silly situations where they were arguing over real issues, and somehow it instantly turned into sex. That caused a little eye rolling, as it wasn’t realistic. But it is what it is.

Throughout the book, they kept alluding to “what happened in Baltimore”, but the truth wasn’t explained until the end. Josh was a genius pediatric oncologist who had a devastating outcome that caused him to shut off his heart to even his unborn child. He convinced himself that he could have a marriage and child and no love for either his wife or child, because that would protect everyone. I kept waiting for Lynsey to say “I know that’s all you can give, but I **deserve** to be loved!” She remained so optimistic and blinded by her own feelings that she didn’t realize his true lack of desire for more for months and months. It took her finally getting a backbone, and leaving for him to get it together. I appreciated her not allowing herself to be a doormat, or her child treated that way.

In the end, they got their HEA. Overall, an enjoyable book. I would encourage anyone interested to push through the beginning, even though it felt vile at the time. Suspend reality for a moment, and look past the over the top ridiculousness, and the rest of the story is enjoyable.",positive

186,Kindle Store,The Scarpetta Factor: Scarpetta (Book 17) (Kay Scarpetta),$1.99,4,"WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD: The Scarpetta Factor effectively wraps up the Chandonne Crime Syndicate arc which began in Black Notice (Point of Origin, retroactively), culminated in Blowfly, and tabled across four other volumes until The Scarpetta Factor. Unlike Scarpetta, The Scarpetta Factor is less of a misnomer and does feature Scarpetta as a more central figure to the plot as this novel sees the end of what Jean-Baptiste Chandonne and his late brother, Jay, began with Dr. Scarpetta in Black Notice.

The return of Jean-Baptiste Chandonne, however, is not at all what may have been expected: instead of Dr. Scarpetta uncovering the escaped serial murderer's resurregence through the foresnic analysis of his murders, as was the case for Temple Gault in Potter's Field, the readers are told that Jean-Baptiste is once again in the picture near the end of the story through the eyes of Benton Wesley by his former employer, the FBI itself. Scarpetta's position as a forensic pathologist is once again inconsequential to the climax and conclusion of the story as she does not uncover or ""solve"" the mystery through her work; ultimately, readers are denied a culminating finale for the Chandonne arc because Scarpetta is herself denied the catharsis of a confrontation with Jean-Baptiste through forensic pathology, the core mechanic of the Kay Scarpetta series. Instead, like prior entries, Scarpetta wanders into a trap laid by the killer, Jean-Baptiste in this instance, and she is saved, once again, through the Deus ex Machina that is her associates -- her husband Benton being lowered to the proverbial stage for this end.

Overall, the story captures the reader's attention, the mystery both deepening and unfolding simultaneously, and further compelled by well-written and nuanced characters with pasts they might rather forget and uncertain futures that lie ahead. This area is where the author truly excels -- bringing the reader characters so real one can almost hold a conversation with them. While the reader may indeed prefer a more cathartic conclusion between Scarpetta and the Chandonne's, the tale is still undeniably riveting.

187,Kindle Store,The Scarpetta Factor: Scarpetta (Book 17) (Kay Scarpetta),$1.99,5,"At first I thought this book was too full of negative emotions. As I kept reading I realized I was getting insights into each character that made the book more full bodied, like one of Scarpetta's good wines.",positive
188,Kindle Store,The Scarpetta Factor: Scarpetta (Book 17) (Kay Scarpetta),$1.99,3,"I agree with the other reviewers that this book is better than what I've come to expect from Cornwell. In fact, I too had decided not to buy any more of her books but, each time she comes out with a new Scarpetta, I just can't help myself!

This one is better than the last few. But at the end I found myself dangling. More specifically, without revealing too much of the story, in the first part of the book, a great deal of time is spent developing story lines for two characters, a CNN talk show host, Hannah Starr, and an old nemesis of Benton's, Warner Agee. But more than half way through the book these characters sort of disappear without so much as a ""by your leave."" For instance, just when the reader is sharing Scarpetta's dismay about Starr stealing her BlackBerry, which isn't password protected yet full of important, private information, Scarpetta finds the device and discovers . . . it has never been opened. Exit Starr, stage left, and as for Agee, his ending is never adequately explained and is simply bizarre (as is Benton's reaction to his enemy's demise). All in all, these weird plot developments just leave the reader scratching his/her head saying ""huh?"" Worse, the twist of who is really ""the bad guy,"" putting Scarpetta in the path of danger once again, is so undeveloped as to be unbelievable.

Cornwell does do a pretty good job of back-filling some information that she missed in earlier books so if you've read the earlier books you may be somewhat mollified. But the promise of the first half of the book is shattered by the weak second half and crowded with unnecessary subplots that do little except distract.

I'm really going to try to avoid the next Scarpetta book.",fair
189,Kindle Store,The Scarpetta Factor: Scarpetta (Book 17) (Kay Scarpetta),$1.99,5,"I admit; I read through almost all of Ms. Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series, mostly as I really enjoyed the characters. None of the books truly put me off, though some of the plots were confusing or left me wanting something more. Yet, these novels always seemed to be a good, fun read. In past, I thought of them as mind candy and enjoyed them as such.

However, this novel is a real cut above the rest. This is the genre at its best. It is a well crafted, tight plot with lots of panache. We learn more about the characters in a lot less time and what we learn is interesting. There were times when I actually found myself holding my breath wondering what a character would do rather than anticipating it.
I have tremendous respect for a writer who takes the time to grow in her writing. These days it is so easy to use a cut and paste formula/template that works- and rework it again and again with slightly different names and settings. So many readers are looking for distraction from life and take comfort from the predictable.

Ms. Cornwell just went from ""mind candy"" to ""good literature"" in a mighty leap.

This is one reader that is very glad that Ms. Cornwell made some major changes that worked beautifully. I am now anxious to follow up on these characters and will put this on my ""must read"" list.

Well done!!!

Her last one, ""Scarpetta"" was fantastic, and now ""The Scarpetta Factor"" is just as good. Yes, it was long; yes, it was exceedingly technical, but I don't mind that. If you've read any of Kathy Reichs' books, you'll see a great deal of techical writing. As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't get in the way of the story.
I'm hopeful that the Scarpetta family of Kay, Benton, Lucy, and Marino will eventually patch up their differences for good and begin loving each other again. Surely enough time has passed now for Kay to finally forgive Benton for faking his seath. Benton should take a clue from Kay and get past what Marino did to her in Charleston. Marino should accept what he did, be glad Kay doesn't hate him, wait for Benton to come around, and move on. Lucy is of an age now that she should start displaying a modicum of maturity and restraint. She may never find the mother substitute she's so desperately seeking in a partner, but she should realize that she has her Aunt Kay and in her is the mother she wants so badly.

196,Kindle Store,Heart Bones,$7.99,5,"Beyah has been dealt a crappy hand in life. Her mother is an addict and Beyah has had to fend for herself since she was little. When Beyah's mother dies, she is left with no alternative but to stay with her estranged father for two months until she leaves for college. When Beyah arrives at her father's place, she is thrown into a foreign life of luxury and leisure. She begins to spend time with Samson, the neighbor, and although she has no interest in a summer fling with a rich guy, she ends up falling for him.

This book spoke to me on so many levels. As someone who grew up in a family with financial struggles, I was astonished and amazed by Colleen Hoover's ability to capture the complexes and experiences of someone who is poor so genuinely and eloquently. Many of Beyah's thoughts and how she related to others who have money resonated with me. I loved the journey that Beyah took in this book. She started off as having come from a small town and only knowing poverty. She made a lot of assumptions and judgements about people with money and she didn't realize how harmful this was in her being able to build connections with her father, step-mother, and step-sister. As she got to know them, she began to see that maybe she was too quick to judge people in the same way she didn't want to be judged.

Beyah's loneliness was palpable. She built high walls around herself because she had been in survival mode most of her life. Beyah was used to hiding herself from others, lying and keeping secrets and she had no one in her corner, cheering her on. Being able to open up to Samson gave her a freedom from that loneliness.

Samson and Beyah had an interesting first encounter that tore at my heart. I knew from that first meeting that their connection was going to grow fast and deep. Although they didn't know each other for that long, they were more real with each other than they had been with anyone else.

As I re-read this book via audio, I noticed things that I hadn't the first time around and it made me appreciate the book even more. Knowing the ending, I was able to catch even more layers of nuances to the story.

This is one of my all-time favorite books and it is a must-read! It's an engrossing and heart-wrenching story that lives rent-free in my mind.

Having just finished It sends With Us, I don’t know if I was ready for another commentary on the plight of the unseen in our society. Yet it popped up in my feed and I was hooked. I knew from Beyah might break my heart with all her strength and pain and determination and loneliness. I just didn’t know how much.

Beyah finally has an option yet she’s too guarded and scarred to see the incredible door that has been opened. She is wary of everything and everyone even her eternally good nature stepsister or her loving yet bewildered father. She meets Sampson who has more secrets than Beyah and she knows that he too is damaged.

Their summer love story is filled with the hope of summer, the ache of knowing fall is around the corner, and the weight of decision that seem monumental.

“‘…You can fill your life with nice things, but nice things don’t fill the holes in your soul.’

‘What fills the holes in a soul?’

Samson’s eyes scroll over my face for a few seconds.’Pieces of someone else’s soul.'”

I guess you could say that I’ve been sitting on writing this review. It isn’t that I didn’t love this book. I adored it. I think it’s more about the idea of letting it go when I wanted to hold onto it a bit more. This is my second Colleen Hoover book, the first one being her last book, Regretting You. I know that her popularity comes from her stories such as Verity and It Ends with Us, and I have every intention of reading those stories. For me, Heart Bones, her newest book, along with Regretting You, have shown me the ways in which she pours herself into her storytelling in ways that are nuanced. That nuance makes for reads that impact you straight into your heart asthe secrets of her stories are divulged. And Heart Bones…it is no different.

The premise of Heart Bones is a young woman on the cusp of change (going off to college) is thrust into her father’s world, a father who can only be considered very absentee. This world is a world of privilege, a world that she did not live in with her mother. There, she meets Samson, the local rich boy. They agree to a summer together before she leaves for college, and they pour themselves into each other. However, as the summer comes to an end, the ability to let go of Samson seems impossible. It is also in that space where the secret of Heart Bones is shown.

What I loved most about this book is its elemental message about loving a person. As humans, we need people to “see” us, to seek to understand us without facade, and we oftentimes go through life without being regarded in elemental ways. It’s like we’re apparitions carrying ourselves through life, never fully engaging and becoming solid in the adoration of another. This is the underlying crux of this story. It’s the beauty of it, quite frankly. As Samson and Beyah encounter each other, (and this may sound corny), their souls acknowledge their similarities, and it creates this romance that is less about the physical (these two are slow-burn) and more about the emotional pull between them. This is a book about soulmates acknowledging their existence for the other, and that makes for a romance rife with depth and gravity.

Even more, Hoover pokes and prods at the notion of socio-economic influence. In many ways Samson and Beyah are the same person, yet they exist at odds in terms of wealth. There is a complication to this in the story that illustrates the farce that a person who is wealthy cannot understand a person who is poor. Hoover bridges this idea with that connection. It’s a reminder that money does not soften life experiences. That it’s possible to understand a person even if your past or upbringing or wealth or lack of it is different from your own. As Samson and Beyah realize this notion, they recognize the reflection of each other in the other. Over and over again, their connections draw you into Heart Bones.

And nuances of Colleen Hoover’s Heart Bones reside in the way it resonates in your soul even though it isn’t romantic by traditional romance standards. In this book and her last, the $exual relationship between her heroes and heroines are minimized in a way. The story isn’t about that. Instead, Hoover sets to tell stories about the human condition that transcend traditional romantic tropes. This is what has bowled me over about the two stories I’ve read thus far. Heart Bones is a story about learning to love yourself, as you find yourself reflected in another. It’s about recognizing that everyone has a story, and you aren’t alone. It’s about finding that person whose story connects with your own and loving them even through the difficulties of life. These messages roll over you again and again in Heart Bones, that when you’ve turned the last page, your heart feels like it’s grown its own heart bones, and you’re already nostalgic for a story that resonates with you in its basic truths about the human condition.",positive

Lucas Fournier and Mia Devine Fournier are Ellie’s parents. Frenched, book one of the Frenched series, is their story. Their story gets a brief addition in Yanked (Frenched: Mia and Lucas 1.5).

FROM IGNITE, BOOK 6:

This story opens in August in northern Michigan, in the town of Traverse City. It is home to Cloverleigh Farms and Abelard Vineyards.

Dex and Winnie’s neighbors-with-benefits age-gap romance is an adorable single dad story. It is amazingly realistic. Dex is not a billionaire. His marriage failed. He missed a lot of milestones in his daughters’ lives, thanks to his career. But he is determined to be a good dad and is devoted to that goal. He is grouchy and prickly, but he is a softy underneath the bluster.

FROM TASTE, BOOK 7:

Note that Gianni and Ellie’s story gets a start in Ignite, and their enemies-to-lovers dynamic is toxic. They get their own story here in Taste, but what happens in Ignite really sets the stage and is worthwhile.

This story opens in January in northern Michigan, in the town of Traverse City. It is home to Cloverleigh Farms and Abelard Vineyards.

Gianni and Ellie don’t have an easy road. They don’t exactly like one another, to begin with. Gianni is fiercely competitive and driven, although there is a protective side that he hides. Despite leaving home for years, he values his family. Ellie, too, is competitive and driven. She is excellent at her job, but when Gianni takes to the limelight, it only exacerbates the divide between them. Their story takes an emotional turn, but they earn a happy ending.

IN THIS BOOK:

Note that Hutton and Felicity appear in Taste, book seven, with a lead-in to their romance.

This story opens on July 9 in northern Michigan, in the town of Traverse City. It is home to Cloverleigh Farms and Abelard Vineyards.

Felicity MacAllister, twenty-eight, blurts out random things when she gets nervous and suffers from occasional nose bleeds. She lacks the fashion sense that her sisters have and is more comfortable with a book. At six she began stress-cutting her hair, a habit that continues to this day. As a result, her hair sometimes has an asymmetrical look, which is putting it nicely. She recently moved back to her Michigan hometown after working at a test kitchen in Chicago. A nerd by nature, she had gone to Brown University where she began to study premed, but she gave it up to pursue her dream instead. Against the advice of so many, she enrolled in culinary school and has never looked back. She has found her niche in vegetarian fare and has plans to build her own business. She now works part-time for Gianni Lupo at Abelard Vineyards, where her sister Winnie works as the wedding coordinator. Separately, she has opened a vegetarian catering business and has begun a food blog that goes by the moniker Veggie Vixen. Her goal is to build a following and to use that success as a launching pad for publishing cookbooks.

As her ten-year high school reunion approaches, Felicity cannot help but take stock of her life. She is living in her father and stepmother’s home and has little to show for herself. She loves her large family, but aside from spending time with her sisters, she has no real social life. She has only had three boyfriends, and none of those relationships lasted more than a few months. The last two tried declaring their love for her, and she couldn’t break up fast enough. She is allergic to love, so to speak, and has a strict hold on her emotions. By rationing her feelings, she hopes to avoid the highs and lows, which is where the danger lies. Her sisters don’t seem to have the same difficulty with relationships that she does, but then again, they didn’t overhear their birth mother’s horrid comments before she walked out on their family. Felicity had been six at the time, but it left a permanent impression on her young mind.

Felicity is content to focus on developing her career for now, and the small catering job she got for her high school reunion is a big opportunity to get reviews and drum up new business. Unfortunately, her attendance puts her in the same room with the mean girls whose comments back in the day fed into her insecurities. When it becomes clear that mean girl Mimi Pepper-Peabody has not changed, Felicity decides to take it sitting down. She gives in to her competitive streak and blurts whatever comes to mind. So when Mimi brags about her millionaire fiancée, Felicity comes back with a comment about her own hot billionaire fiancée.

Hutton French, twenty-eight, is a math genius and a sci-fi nerd. Socially awkward, he clams up when nervous and has a tendency to fidget. As the billionaire CEO of San Francisco-based HFX, a cryptocurrency exchange, he has his choice of women. He is pictured in the tabloids with models and influencers; he and Lithuanian supermodel Zlatka graced covers for a few months in the spring. Despite what it might look like, Hutton doesn’t actually get out much. He hates parties, and the idea of small talk terrifies him. He is content living as a recluse, but he is good at faking confidence when necessary. He is not wired for relationships, although he has tried. The effort exhausts him and the woman is always bitterly disappointed once the novelty wears off. Friendships are a challenge, too, since he rarely goes out.

Hutton co-founded HFX with his roommate from MIT. Wade Hasbrouck is from old money and is good with people, allowing Hutton to focus on the back end of the business and the algorithm he created. Wade encourages Hutton to get out more, but it is never an easy task. Wade hardly understands Hutton’s excuses. Hutton works long hours, but it is not about the money for him. He donates generously to worthy causes and is not at all pretentious. He loves his family – his parents and his sister’s family – and takes time to visit occasionally. He rented a house in his hometown for three months this summer just to be close to them. He arrived in May and plans to return to San Francisco when the rental agreement expires on August 15. Conveniently, his best friend has moved back to the area so they have been able to reconnect and spend time together.

Although Hutton and Felicity have kept in touch from time to time, they largely went their separate ways after high school. They met in math class at age twelve and soon became best friends. They enjoyed books and movies together, participated in the math and chemistry clubs, and both played in the marching band. She is the person that knows him best in the world, the only one that sees behind the mask. He feels a unique comfort with her that eases his anxiety. He has wanted to kiss her since he was fifteen, and he had a few chances, but he never knew if she felt the same way about him. The idea of ruining their friendship always stopped him from taking that risk.

When Felicity calls on an old promise, Hutton has no choice but to step up and come to her aid. Their fake engagement goes awry when it leaks to the press and their families find out. Felicity wants to put an end to the lie before more damage is done, but Hutton has another idea. With an important Congressional hearing approaching, he can use the engagement to keep his mother’s matchmaking efforts at bay and buy him some peace and quiet in preparation for his appearance in D.C. They agree to stretch out the fake engagement until he heads back to California. The line between fake and real begins to blur all too quickly, putting the couple’s fool-proof plan at risk. The couple eventually earns a very well-deserved happy ending.

In this book, Felicity’s older sister Millie, who is thirty-two, plays a small role. She does not yet have her own book, but her story appears to begin here.

Don’t forget to download the free bonus scene via the link at the back of the book. It takes place two years into the future.

Wow! Hutton and Felicity are adorably damaged in this best friend fake engagement romance. Their friendship is too important to risk losing, so they have never crossed that line before. But when they find themselves fake-engaged, they discover the pretext to act out some of that long-repressed attraction. The underlying problems still exist, though, so they must tread lightly or risk losing it all. With their families and the press showing an uncomfortable amount of interest in their engagement, the pressure is intense.

Hutton and Felicity’s tender story has you rooting for the couple’s happy ending. Their damaged personalities feel all too real, and missed opportunities have cost them years of happiness together. Although to others they come across as awkward, they are adorable together. Hutton is sweet and attentive, while Felicity is patient and thoughtful. They are good for one another. It is their deep respect for one another that fuels their paralyzing fear of rejection. There are nine laugh-out-loud moments by my count and five teary moments. Unlike so many stories, I did not feel my time was taken advantage of by the story. There was no unnecessary drama that felt misplaced or manipulative. The story works. It is deep and personal, but there are many light moments that balance it out. It addresses the issues of anxiety and panic attacks.

Hutton and Felicity’s touching story is another great addition to the Cloverleigh Farms world. There are a few laughs as well as some tears. It is wonderfully written. The plot is fairly simple. The story is character-driven. The characters are complex and carefully crafted, and their stories are compelling. The story is told in first person. The POV alternates between Hutton and Felicity. I rate this book five stars.",positive
207,Kindle Store,Tease,$4.99,5,"This book was fantastic and deserves thousands of stars!!!! I was so looking forward to Felicity's story after reading Winnie's book. I love a friends to lovers romance so much and this one was amazing!!! Especially when Hutton turned into a HOT NERD!!!
Felicity is Mack's middle child from his first marriage. She's not like her sisters because she's always thought of herself as awkward. She's also super smart and kind of a nerd. She has also been holding a secret from her family since she was around 6-8 years old. She overheard a fight between her parents and heard her mom say she never wanted her daughters. Felicity kept that to herself because she didn't want her sisters to hurt like she did. She is such a caring person who puts others ahead of herself. This was the start of her ""hair cuts"", due to stress.
Hutton has always been a numbers guy. He's also a nerd but he used to be kind of a norma kid too. Until his grandfather died. He thought he had magical powers that could keep him alive. When he died, so did that normal little boy inside him. That's when his anxiety started. So, he and Felicity were kind of made for each other.
The whole fake engagement starts at their 10 year reunion because of one of Felicity's bullies trying to make her feel small. Her mouth gets the better of her and she says stuff without thinking. She gets Hutton to go along with it for a few reasons. One, it gets his mother off his back about finding love. And he is into Felicity but too scared to admit it to himself or her. This is where things get interesting!!!
These two were literally made for each other!! They get each other and have for 15 years. Felicity doesn't care about his money and Hutton doesn't care that she sometimes cuts her hair! They have loved each other since high school and it was beautiful to watch them realize it as adults. There are some slip ups here and there, but they resolve them in such wonderful ways!! I was proud of Hutton toward the end when he redeemed himself!!!
It was so great to be back at Cloverleigh Farms!!! I so love these characters! I truly hope that Millie gets a book, because I am so there for it!!!! Thank you Melanie Harlow for continuing to grace us with your words and your talent!!",positive
208,Kindle Store,Tease,$4.99,5,"I adore a good fake fiancé romance and Ms. Harlow has given us a great one with Felicity and Hutton’s story! Being back in the Cloverleigh Farms world had a smile on my face the entire time I was reading this book. Felicity is a woman that grabbed my heart with all her quirky tendencies; especially when it comes to how she deals with stressful situations. While I laughed in a lot of those moments, I also had a lump in my throat at the same time because my heart hurt for her.

Oh Hutton…. He’s all tall, sexy, swoony and billionaire but he’s also humble at the same time. He doesn’t really flaunt his wealth either. He’s still the somewhat shy and feels slightly geeky and he “doesn’t people” very well. I know exactly how that feels these days LOL! But a promise is a promise and he’d do anything for his BFF so when the call comes, he answers and so begins their fake engagement!

I devoured this book practically in one-sitting. I loved how Hutton and Felicity truly took to this fake relationship which allowed their hidden crushes to emerge and oh my stars…these two are bursting with chemistry!

Throughout this entire book, not only are we seeing two people that are meant to be with each other even if it took some odd circumstances to get there, we also see the rest of the MacAllister family and there were some truly hilarious moments that only sisters can share and find funny… but these sisters are also very protective of each other and their love knows no boundaries. When you add in Frannie and their Dad, it’s a fabulous story that is a perfect addition to this series.",positive
209,Kindle Store,Tease,$4.99,5,"Melanie Harlow’s book was written beautifully, it’s a heart squeezer. It’s taking a chance on love and truly getting what you deserve. Accepting yourself because the one who accepts you does it whole heartedly and unconditionally. Because you don’t have to be perfect for love.

I connected, because the words didn’t just tell me what they were doing, it made me feel what they were doing. It was exciting. That can be difficult with friends to lovers. But, the author delivers!!!

Hutton is quiet on the outside, his mind is constantly going to the next task, or worry, but he loves to edge and control in the bedroom. A billionaire with a sensitive soul and a kink for tying women up!

Felicity is hardworking, wants to make her own way with catering and blogging. She puts one step forward every time, every day, but deep down she feels very abandoned.

They were high school besties, its best friend to lovers, and it gave me goosebumps.

They are both so alive when they are together. There is no pity between them and their secrets they tell one another. It’s the power of acceptance that made this couple give it a try!

She is the calm and present to his overthinking mind. He is the contentment and superhero to her broken heart. Together, they don’t need magic!

Practice makes perfect when you are faking your engagement, and boy did they like to practice 🥃😮‍💨",positive
210,Kindle Store,Tease,$4.99,5,"I loved, loved Felicity and Hutton’s story. It’s a wonderfully swoony heartwarming childhood friends fake relationship story of all the things and all the feelings. Felicity is just starting her vegetarian catering business and is excited to cater part of her HS reunion. But when the mean girl makes her uncomfortable, she blurts out she’s engaged to her best friend, Hutton, and begs him to play along. Hutton is a self made billionaire who is generally a ball of awkward anxiety. Nevertheless he plays along as Felicity’s fiancée for the reunion but the story gets out so they decide to keep up the pretense. Since the journey to their HEA started at age 12, and they are both awkward and fearful, it was a long roller coaster of a ride but the ending was beautiful. The book did a great job of showing the inner thoughts and feelings of the MCs and how their pasts influenced their choices in the present. Felicity and Hutton are real, relatable people who have flaws, but are really trying to just do their best as messy scared humans. This book has a little bit of everything - sweet moments, strong friendships and family, sexy times, real life issues, imperfect characters, chuckles, painful pasts, and all the love. Expect to feel all the things as you read about Felicity and Hutton - you will laugh, cry, swoon, grind your teeth, cheer, and happy sigh. I am loving this series.",positive
211,Kindle Store,Tease,$4.99,5,"Oh my goodness!! I loved these two!!! Hutton and Felicity are adorable and quirky and soooo perfectly made for one another. Their love for each other is obvious even from the glimpse back in high school. They just had the stereotypical, don’t wanna ruin our friendship problem.

Being awkward, Felicity runs her mouth and finds herself in a lie that only Hutton can help fix. Hutton see this as his way of crossing the line he always wanted to, without risking their friendship. My oh my, Hutton is a dirty talker considering how shy and socially awkward he is. So. Damn. Sexy. It just made it hard because their miscommunication was so high!

Regardless, I loved every bit of the light heartfelt story! Felicity and Hutton are the perfect friends to lovers duo with some amazing practice sessions. Yes, practice sessions, which spurred well past kissing, quickly. 😅. I loved how Hutton and Felicity were willing to do whatever to have each other once they both put aside their anxieties.

I would 100% recommend this book!!! It’s the next generation of the Cloverleigh Farms series and I loved them so far! So excited for what will come next too!",positive
212,Kindle Store,Tease,$4.99,5,"Melanie Harlow gives us a real sexy treat with this friends to lovers gem, Tease.

Hutton has loved Felicity since they were kids together. Then life happened and he headed to the big city and made billions. He's spending the summer in his home town, enjoying hiding out, spending time with Felicity. Felicity gets nervous on their 10 yr high school reunion and bluffs out to the mean girl how she's engaged to Hutton. He hadn't wanted to go, but because she asks he shows up.

That turns into a fake engagement when their families get wind of it but will these two have the good sense to make it permanent? Especially when they are so ooo perfect for each other?

This is a sexy 5 star delight as only Melanie Harlow can deliver!

I do love me a good childhood friends to lovers romance and Tease fit that bill perfectly! Felicity & Hutton's story was a little different than the norm, though- instead of the typical pining you'd find with friends who don't want to ruin things between them by admitting their feelings, things kind of accelerated when they entered into a mutually greed upon fake relationship. I love when characters think they'll be able to keep within the boundaries they've set for themselves, when you know good and well that is not going to happen!

Felicity and Hutton did give it a good try though, even as they let things move beyond platonic. These two had such a strong history, everyone could see how perfect they were together except themselves! Until things did become too real and they both found themselves unsure how to continue.

I loved Hutton's character- he reminded me a little of Sebastian from Some Sort of Happy, one of my all time favorites. Hutton's just so endearing. I love a vulnerable male who's not afraid to share his softer side with the people he loves. And Felicity was awesome- I loved how she really came into her own in this story. I really liked how real both of these characters felt, even billionaire Hutton! They're people you'd love to spend time with, to be friends with, ones you know you could always count on.",positive
214,Kindle Store,Tease,$4.99,5,"This town, this place, these people, it feels like coming home. There may be some new chartacters, but they fit right into this world I fell for with the original Cloverleigh Farms Series. I love romance novels with relatable characters, and both Hutton and Felicity are very relatable. Between both of their personalities and behaviors, most readers will find something in which they connect.

I love a Melanie Harlow friends to lovers story. Add in a fake engagement and I’m over the moon. Something I really enjoyed in this one was that the situation gave Felicity and Hutton permission to experience “more” without having to give themselves over to an actual relationship. Without having to be scared and vulnerable, they had freedom to just be. Obviously that would not last forever but can you imagine that freedom? It made for a beautiful story and a great way to get to know the characters. This was a fantastic return to Cloverleigh. I really did enjoy this one!!",positive

thank you to melanie harlow & social butterfly for the ARC!

last month i binge read 11 melanie harlow books and this one was my 12th. you could say i’m hooked! this had SO many of my favorite tropes. what really stood out about this specific billionaire is that hutton was not cocky at all. he has a lot of social anxiety and is a lot shyer. i really enjoy the change of pace for a billionaire. but don’t let that fool you, he’s an alpha in the bedroom. and not was the slice here. i am so glad to see felicity grown up. she is so funny and i love how deeply she cares. there were definitely parts of this that had me in the feels, and then a bunch of other times where i was completely swooning over their relationship. i love these second generation books because you get to see the kids grow up and find love. i can’t wait to read all about millie’s story. also, that epilogue had me wheeping! love hutton and felicity so much!!!

216,Kindle Store,Funny You Should Ask: A Novel,$9.99,5,"As a general rule, I HATE second chance romances... but I LOVED this. I was hesitant to pick this up because of the couple's complicated past, but that all faded into the background as I became immersed in this truly unique love story. Told in flashbacks, present day, and snippets of articles that fill in the gaps, we see how these characters have changed and grown over the last ten years. We see all of the ways they messed things up in the past, as well as all of the ways they are PERFECT for each other in the present. If you're someone who enjoys puzzling out a mysterious hero, then you're going to love this one - piecing together all of the little breadcrumbs that show the depth of his feelings and just how much he thought of her in their time apart. These two fell hard and fast over the course of a single weekend, and they've had ten years apart to let those feelings simmer, fester, or grow. There's really no way to tell until the whole story is told. And one of the best things - beyond the obvious zap of chemistry - is that the story is told in such a way that I was completely and utterly invested in seeing how things played out in the past AND the present.

The story follows Chani, a journalist who couldn't have predicted the countless ways that one interview would change her life. As a 26-year-old, she was starstruck and smitten to meet sexy actor Gabe. Tasked with writing an article that would make Gabe look good, Chani was surprised to discover that they seemed to have a connection that had nothing to do with the article she was writing. And the time they spent together that weekend seemed to confirm that... until it didn't. Ten years later, Chani would like to believe that she's both older and wiser. That article changed the trajectory of her career, and the whispers about that weekend have not quieted in the years since. So when Chani is asked to interview Gabe again - now a star who has lost his shine after a divorce and a few trips to rehab - she's hoping to get some closure and move past it once and for all. But spending time together again makes those old feelings come rushing back, and it's possible that finally getting everything out in the open will change everything.

I've gotta give it to Sussman - she managed to make this relationship feel rich and deep, despite the fact that Chani and Gabe have only spent a handful of days together. They had that first potential-filled weekend that went horribly wrong, then only brief interactions in the years since. So it's amazing how much history they have, and how much the intimacy grows between them. The story seems to be a bit polarizing to readers, and I can see how that element wouldn't work for some - but it definitely did for me. There are plenty of lighthearted moments, splashes of angst, longing, and a TON of unfulfilled potential. As much as I wanted to shake them over the miscommunication, it was also easy to see that the Chani and Gabe of the past wouldn't have worked out. They needed that time apart, and Gabe needed to get sober. I was even (shockingly) okay with the fact that they both married and divorced other people during those years as well - hurt people hurt people, and returning to safer relationships made sense to me. Besides, they'd only spent a matter of hours together, and neither one was entirely sure of the other's motivations. Once they face the truth of their feelings, the entire dynamic shifts. It's a complex story that drew me in more and more as it progressed, until I was incredibly engrossed. I loved it.

Audio note: The audio is great! The story is told exclusively from Chani's point of view, so it's a single narrator, but she does an excellent job. Her performance brought Chani to life, and it was also easy to differentiate between the characters. The runtime (under 8 hours) was perfect for bingeing in one sitting, which is great because that's exactly what I wanted to do. And the tone of the book was ideal for the audio format, especially given the narrator's strong performance. It's an achingly slow burn with just a little spice, so the book is also a good pick for a workday listen - you'd even be able to fit the whole story into a day at the office. While this would be a great read in any format, the audio enhances it even further.",positive

This book was a work of art...and that basically sums up my views of the novel. The way she wrote it was spectacular...My only critique of the book is that it should have showed more of Gabe's pov, but thats pretty much it. This is definitely a summer vacation read! its an AMAZING plane book; I completed it in one session on a 4-hour airplane ride.

I didn’t like some of the things he did, but I think I understood them. My feelings toward Chani were more complicated. I didn’t understand how she could go back to Jeremy, who was a thoroughly narcissistic jerk, in New York, a place she didn’t even like.

I enjoyed the way much of the story was told through Chani’s articles, and went back and forth between then and now.

I knew when I read the description that I would enjoy this book, what I didn't know is how fast I would fly through this book. The only thing stopping me from reading this in one sitting was this pesky thing called ""needing sleep before work"".

Chani Horowitz is a writer, strugging to figure out her place in her career when shes given the biggest opportunity of her career. Chani is set to write a profile on Gabe Parker, movie star, celebrity crush, (former) phone screen background, and newest Hollywood James Bond. This interview changed everything.

Chani walked in, sweaty pits and all, ready to ask her questions, when shes met with her hollywood crush handing over his puppy while he scrambles to clean up puppy pee shirtless. The interview takes a rather unorthodox turn when Gabe starts asking Chani questions of his own and their conversation/ interview turns from just an hour or so, into the entire day, then the entire weekend.

The interview that came after? Well that changed everything. Chani's profile started her career, and kept everyone asking ""what happened that weekend?"".

A decade later, two failed marriages, a declining acting carreer, a few times in rehab, and a lot of writing later, the two are back together for another interview.

I cannot explain how much I loved this book enough. Sussman's use of then-and-now story telling and articles between time will have you flipping through pages so fast, needing to see what's happened and what will happen. Sussman will make you laugh, cry, and absolutely fall in love with these two characters who are working against their own inner turmoils to find a way to survive the world their careers put them in.

Gabe Parker is Chani's dream come true, but Chani is Gabe Parker's biggest success.

I liked the variety the author used in telling the story. Sometimes she added celebrity gossip articles, blog posts and essays to the narrative enhancing the Hollywood vibe.

Both Gabe and Chani were characters that acted on youthful impulse or over reaction and the determined the course of their lives until their paths crossed again ten years later.

There’s no such thing as a truly original idea, but I’m really curious if the author was inspired by that. Also I personally love off the wall creative celeb profiles so this really hit the spot. The will they won’t they tension and interruptions were frustrating, but I’m chalking it up to the author simulating the sexual frustration between the characters, hahaha",positive
222,Kindle Store,Funny You Should Ask: A Novel,$9.99,5,"I loved the way this book was written, how the story unfolded between alternating sections about what happened 10 years ago and today. Sprinkled throughout are excerpts from various reviews, essays, and Chani’s personal blog from her younger days and her newsletter from more recent days. It comes together as a cohesive and complete story, told not only from the protagonist’s viewpoint but also how the outside world views it.

Chani is a young journalist trying to make her mark in the world; Gabe is an up and coming movie star. He has been cast as the new James Bond, much to the chagrin of die-hard James Bond fans (an American as James Bond? Sacrilege!). So Chani is assigned the task of writing a piece on Gabe with the intention of making his choice as the new James Bond more believable.

What starts as an afternoon interview turns into a weekend together. And leads to an article by Chani that makes her career while also giving Gabe the credibility he needs. But it comes at the cost of the world believing that surely Chani had to have slept with him to gain the access she acquired.

10 years later, she’s asked to do another interview with him. They’re both older and wiser, having gone through turmoil and heartache in their lives. Gabe has had a divorce and two stints in rehab, Chani has divorced her jerk of a husband and continues to deal with the fallout from that first interview. What begins as an awkward encounter turns into a chance for them to truly understand and connect with each other.

This is one of those books that I had to finish before I could go to sleep, otherwise I’d lie awake thinking about it all night. I not only loved the way it was written but loved the story also. It’s not your typical “romance” novel following the specific “romance” formula.

I’d like to thank Netgalley and the publisher for providing an advance copy of this book!",positive
223,Kindle Store,Funny You Should Ask: A Novel,$9.99,5,"Let me start by saying that I do not read romance often… I usually find it boring, tedious and fake. I saw this book on tiktok and the story line peaked my interest a reporter that turned her real life interview into a book? Yes, please. - but also that was incorrect 😂

I was not disappointed, I read a about 60pages and then I knew I needed to finish/ put aside all other books cause I was not going to be able to put it down…. And I didn’t not for a whole day. I cried and I laughed and fell in-love with every character on this book. It felt real and I was also happily surprised that there wasn’t an insane amount of “spice” that appears is a requirement in every book now.

I loved that you get the dual timelines and you get to see/know the characters on both timelines - you get sneak peaks of newspapers articles and review and journal entries- and it never feels forced or out of order… and in some cases (Ollie’s interview) it leaves you wanting more.

I can honestly say I will be re-reading this book again. Maybe it will be my summer read from now on and I’ll be buying copies for my friends too.",positive
224,Kindle Store,Funny You Should Ask: A Novel,$9.99,5,"i'm about to make this book my entire personality.

just based on the summary of the book, i knew it'd be something i'd be into. it checks a lot of boxes for me: celebrities, celebrity culture, journalism, famous person/normal person romances, etc. i loved this book even more than i was expecting to.

chani and gabe were an amazing pair. even though i did spend so much of the book trying to figure out the exact amalgamation of celebs sussman used to create gabe (i have so many thoughts), he still felt wholly original. he was so charming, as james bond should be! but i especially loved how kind and thoughtful he was, the way he turned chani's questions around onto her just because he was genuinely curious. and chani was an incredible match for him. she felt familiar, reminding me of my own best friend (especially during her rant about 'angels in america'). and together, in both the then and now sections, it was impossible not to root for them. also, i absolutely adored ollie. he was a fabulous side character and i loved that in the ""now"" sections he wasn't just there for gabe, he was there for chani, too. i also really appreciated how seriously chani took the fact that ollie was placing a lot of trust in her to not reveal his sexuality before he was ready. this book could have very easily included some kind of outing plot and i'm glad it didn't.

i also really loved the way this story was structured and the way sussman didn't reveal all of the information at once. it made me want to keep reading to understand the things chani was referencing in her internal monologue. outside media, like other articles, are integral to this story as well; i liked how they filled in the gaps and informed character decisions from a detached pov.",positive

236,Kindle Store,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.99,5,"What I liked most about this book is the depictions of believably real (though fictional) characters challenged by real-life issues, with the characters' basic motivations well described and integrated into a story of how the characters succeed or fail against their challenges, and why. I believe the philosophical term for literature of this kind is ""metaphysical values.""

(I haven't seen the movie so far but probably will see it eventually. Meanwhile, the various trailers that I've seen seem to indicate that the novel's main spirit may have been badly mangled in the movie, possibly to emphasize issues such as racial prejudice and other forms of bias against those who are ""different,"" and other contemporary concerns. From various critical reviews on this website, it also appears that the story itself may have greatly misrepresented what North Carolina was actually like in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. But I don't see geographical or historical accuracy as necessarily essential to a fictional story concretizing important metaphysical values.)

At the end of the novel, in the Q&A with the author (pp. 376-377), there is a very concise description of what the book is about. The story follows the life of a young girl named ""Kya"" living mostly alone in fictional marshlands in North Carolina from age 6 to her death from natural causes (unexpected heart failure) at age 64. It's a story of how she survives with minimal help from anyone else. A child of 6 wouldn't have been able to survive alone for long without significant knowledge and experience gained from interaction with other humans, and she did receive minimal interaction with her mother, brother, father, brother's friend Tate (later Kya's first lover and eventual husband after a fateful 2nd love with Chase Andrews), and a married (black) couple in the nearby fictional town of Barkley Cove. Tate and Chase both disappoint Kya deeply, Chase so strongly that Kya becomes the prime suspect when Chase is found dead, apparently murdered. (Chase lied to her about potentially marrying her, and he even tried to rape her, causing her to fear that Chase would keep trying again and again by force.) Before Tate leaves her while he goes to college, she learns to read with Tate's help. He also gives her many old books to read, mostly on life science. She apparently never receives access to any books in literature, history, philosophy, or other general humanities subjects. She remains forever shy and defensive toward most other people despite becoming highly adept at studying the wild animals and plants in the marsh, writing books of her own on her observations, becoming successful as a published author, and painting vivid sketches of what she observed. Along the way, she also learns to count beyond 29 and to count money and make change, again with help from Tate and others.

At her trial for the murder of Chase, the prosecution presents serious evidence against her, but the evidence isn't quite strong enough to obtain a guilty verdict from the jury (beyond reasonable doubt). She has an especially good alibi, although it has weaknesses that leave room to doubt her innocence. Since there are also reasonable doubts about her guilt, the jury verdict is ""not guilty."" One key piece of evidence, a ""shell necklace,"" remains missing until the very last page of the story, shortly after Kya's death, when Tate (whom she had married by then) finds it. For those who want to be surprised, I won't say more about the details of the ending. Kya certainly would have had to be incredibly resourceful and daring, perhaps far larger than real life, to have been able to construct such a convincing alibi, if she actually was the murderer. The symbolic parallel to the mating rituals of fireflies provides a strong hint about Kya's mental state.

The events of the story are mainly just the backdrop. The story's main focus is on how Kya felt and how she learned so much about nature and life sciences from her own direct observations and from books that she read, without ever attending school at any level for more than one deeply unpleasant day at age 6. Despite how little she learned about humanities subjects and how to deal with other people, the story depicts her as focused on the reality that she was exposed to, and on how she used her natural intellectual capacity to make sense of it as best she could. She certainly functioned on a reality-is-real premise, though without explicitly identifying that premise or comprehending its higher implications for human living; she also felt her emotions without any explicit appeal to any greater mysticism or other-worldly perspective. (Kya shows no superstitiousness or religious worship of natural phenomena.) But the story doesn't attempt to delve further than that into issues of values, why man needs them, and how best to choose and pursue one's values. With access to books, Kya surely would have had the opportunity to do such deeper reading in real life, even if she remained otherwise isolated from most other people throughout her life. She had Tate, along with the two adult townspeople, her publisher, and to some extent her brother Jodie -- all of whom provided emotional support to her during her trial. She is a heroine of sorts, though a severely stunted and crippled one, especially emotionally toward others.

The author describes the story as ""primarily about self-reliance, survival and how isolation affects human behavior. Since our species is a social mammal, we have strong genetic tendencies to belong to a group of tightly bonded family and friends."" (P. 376.) What ""genetic tendencies"" does this refer to? How much personal choice do humans have? Man has a non-automatic rational faculty on which he needs to depend for his survival. But he also needs a lot of help from others, especially family, along the way as he proceeds from the stage of a newborn infant to adult life. Without such help in childhood, the stunted growth that may hinder a child's development and readiness for adult living should not be surprising. A more heroic kind of story might explore more fully how much more a person can learn about life from books, and how events might unfold as such a person strives to apply such learnings in practice. Kya certainly makes a valiant and largely successful effort, which, for me, makes Crawdads excellent as far as it goes.",positive
237,Kindle Store,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.99,5,"I just finished reading (and crying through) the first novel by naturalist Delia Owens entitled, “Where the Crawdads Sing”. She has achieved a literary feat uncommon to naturalists, let alone novelists. 67 weeks at the top? Her readers are not wrong. But first, let’s talk about crawdads…

Do they sing? No. They are tiny freshwater lobsters that live underwater. They only sing, as do Maine, and rock lobsters, when you put them in a pot of boiling water and the steam expands through their exoskeleton. So no, they do not sing, nor do they do anything else that can remotely be depicted as human. However, the phrase, “Where the crawdads, sing”, is fully defined by Owens thus cannot be confused in her novel The reference to their presumed music as defined by Owens is one of her many uses of a colloquialism. She spells it out using the complete phrase, “ Way out yonder where the crawdads sing”. More context for the less colloquial is that the full phrase means in the middle of nowhere. Which is exactly where the story takes place. In the middle of nowhere. It takes place in a marsh (not a swamp, there's a difference) along some stretch of coast on the eastern seaboard of the United States. The exact location doesn’t exist. It’s fictional. Owens includes a map, which I referenced frequently. Mind you, this is no Narnia, this is no Middle Earth, but this is as real a place, even more real, than any presumed backdrop for any other great novel. West Egg for instance. Just like West Egg on the north shore of Long Island, this marsh on the eastern shore of North Carolina cannot be found on any map, nevertheless, it’s a place I would like to visit.

The phrase, thus, refers to being beyond the most remote area of the wild as possible. Off the map, off the grid. Way out yonder where the crawdads sing. A place, very different from, and as remote as, any place in Africa where Owens spent much of her professional life as a naturalist. Beyond anything we know, the marsh she created is truly in the middle of nowhere. It is here where the main character, Kya, finds herself alone. She has been left alone by family and most of humanity. We are witness to the abandonment. As a little girl she is forced to live on her own and survive in the wild. Shades of Jody Foster from the movie Nell…except she speaks English and she has a lot more food to eat. That is, if you like seafood. Mussels and smoked fish, and whatever sprouts from a shabby wild vegetable garden. She was not raised by wolves, or gorillas, but instead by the marsh itself. And a lot of seagulls and other sea birds. The marsh is her mother. Most of us couldn’t fathom the life of Kya--essentially on her own since age seven. Think about that for a moment…if you don’t cry…you should. I cried three times in the first 125 pages of the story. I cried 4 or 5 more times before the end of the story.

This book, I presume since Owens is well read having spent a lot of time on her own, crosses many genres. Her naturalist side shines through as the wild is on display on every page. Yet her story is a murder mystery since the body of Chase Andrews is found dead in the marsh in the prologue. She uses poetry frequently. Her own poetry, which is quite good. And of course, it is a love story of deep dimension. Difficult--to say the least--because finding love in the middle of nowhere is not easy. Unless you find it within yourself. One can’t say it’s a coming of age story, since the novel spans all of Kya’s lifetime…but yes…a Marsh Girl can come of age…and have it all. And of course there is the courtroom scene related to the murder. Pick an author, Grisham, perhaps. We shall see when Hollywood releases their version in a few months how Owens dialogue holds up to Perry Mason. Will the courtroom dialogue be credible? Despite Kya’s profound literacy, which you will discover on her journey, Kya doesn’t pull a Lisbeth Salander (Stieg Larsson) and turn the tables on the court. She’s more humble, crippled outside her marsh, withdrawn from the process, meditating, and mostly concerned with the cat who lives in the court house. If you are rooting for her, as I was, prepare for another bout of tears.

The book is a page turner because this story jumps from the pages and comes alive in your mind. Kya is real. She is alive. She will now exist in literature just as Captain Ahab and his whale. Kya and her Marsh. Owens brought her to life through her thoughts, her paintings, her poetry, and her music. Perhaps the best apologetic for an absent family, Owens walks through the conditions that must have been present for those responsible for her abandonment to receive forgiveness. As well as those who cared, but not enough, to keep her isolated. The reckoning, in the courtroom, was perhaps insufficient. Justice could never be served for the rising fear and prejudice visited upon this young girl by a town full of ignorant people. Yet some did rise above, in their own way, and Kya understood. It’s her understanding of human nature, through the eyes of our own evolution that shows us that we are not too far removed from the animal kingdom. There but for the grace of God…not into the fires of hell but rather into the bountiful Garden of Eden--the Marsh. The sins of the animal kingdom cannot be judged as sins--as when an injured mother fox leaves her kits in order to survive to another day where perhaps she may rear another litter when survival is more certain. Can the momma fox be judged?

This is perhaps Owen’s legacy. Crawdads don’t sing--a fiction at best and anthropomorphism at worst. She knows it. Animals do not take on human characteristics. Only the truly ignorant would believe things move in that direction. Fake naturalists such as Elizabeth Marshall Thomas (The Hidden Life of Dogs) springs to mind as the purveyor of such garbage. Rather we can now look to Owens as the author of something as profound and insightful as from the true greats like Henry David Thoreau who wrote, ""In wildness is the preservation of the world”. Here is where Owens lives. Here is where Owens sings. Her voice a whisper above the din but a true voice calling out in the wilderness to be heard above the wind through the palmetto trees or the waves crashing on the sand leading into the marsh. To the gulls who circle above the beach and are friends with Kya as she sleeps. To the other wildlife that saunter by her without pause. She is one of them, not the other way around. Justice, therefore, is a natural one and subscribes to nature’s law. Balance in this natural world can always be restored. This is the true beauty of Owens' novel and no doubt the key to her success. Five-Stars for Owen’s first novel and this literary feat. A must read for everyone who claims they read books. Kya will stay with me, and you, forever...",positive
238,Kindle Store,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.99,4,"True story. I tried to listen to the audio of this book 3 years ago. After the first couple of chapters, I didn't like it at that time and I left it for other novels.

Recently, I decided that I needed to give it another try since I want to watch the movie and I prefer to read the book first before I see it on the screen.

I don't know if I can add anything in regard to the plot. I'm sure so many people know what this book is about but if you have been living on a deserted island without working wifi for the last few years, then my review is for you.

Kya Clark is a small child when she is abandoned by her mother, then her siblings, and lastly, her father who leaves one day to never come back. His father was abusive and this is why her mother and siblings left the Marsh.

Kya gets nicknamed the Marsh Girl and she learns to survive on her own thanks to nature and her own desire to make it.

In 1969, Kya is a young woman when the body of Chase Andrews is found and the townspeople point a finger at Kya as the main suspect. After all, rumor has it that Chase visited her all the time.

Where the Crawdads Sing brought out so many emotions from sadness to anger to disappointment to happiness.

Delia Owens makes the Marsh a character on its own. She did a wonderful job at bringing it to life. The way Kya learns from it was amazing!

The isolation that Kya suffers because of where she was from was heartbreaking to read. A young kid left behind by everyone and no one really cared to help her except for Tate and Jumpin'. She was misunderstood and cast away, worse than an animal. Then there was the mystery of who killed Chase and why. If I'm being honest, I figured it out early on. However, I still like the way the story developed.

Time to watch the movie.

239,Kindle Store,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.99,4,"The storyline in this novel is good, but not strong, and the lush, detailed descriptions of the North Carolina wetlands and marshes are exquisite. Kya is a sympathetic character from the beginning, but I felt like she never really grew much as a person. Her outlook on life remained childlike even into old age. The ending was not surprising other than the identity of the poetry writer, and while the last chapter wrapped those interspersed poems together, I found them distracting throughout the novel - I wasn't sure why some of them were there. I think I could have found the ending a little more plausible if Kya had shown any deep-seated anger for everyone who disappeared from her life (and everyone did), and she forgave some of them, but not others, and ultimately acted on one with a wave of anger I didn't get from her throughout the story. Loneliness and loss, yes. Some anger at those whose attrition she never understood, yes. But angry enough to do the unspeakable? I didn't get this vibe from her character's psychological profile.

As a lawyer, I thought the courtroom scenes were very well done, but when Kya's lawyer didn't put her on the stand to testify, I knew what the outcome would be. That probably wouldn't resonate with the average reader, so it worked well, though that part of the plotline was pushing the limits a bit. No matter how well-read Kya became as she educated herself with Tate's help (and unless she was a prodigy, she wouldn't have learned as much as she did in five years), I don't think she would have had enough experience with the real world or the knowledge to set up and successfully navigate her actions with the precision she did where Chase was concerned. The author also didn't do enough research into the State of North Carolina concerning distances (it's a good eight hours or more from the fictional town she lives near to Asheville), family histories (her father's family didn't come from a plantation near Asheville - there weren't any of those - mostly small farms), and dialects of characters from different parts of the state (the ones with accents were either evil or not, but Kya spoke perfect dialect free English). All that aside, this book isn't a bad first novel, though the author's developmental editor should have fixed some of the problems it has. I don't think it's bestseller material.",positive
240,Kindle Store,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.99,4,"Well, I read the entire book in one day, so I can't say it didn't hold me until the end, but so much of it was disappointing, given the hype and the gushing over it. The descriptions of the marsh and of Kya's awakening as she learned to read and found entire worlds to explore near her home were brilliant. But the love stories read like a cheesy romance novel, a jarring contrast from the much more nuanced nature writing, and something I couldn't get past.
The dialogue, for the most part, felt like it belonged in a different book, considering how great the descriptive passages are. Very little of it rang true, and some of the dialect was off-putting and offensive--as in the conversations with Jumpin' and Mabel. (Shades of Steppin Fetchit.)
Chase said 'ya' instead of 'you', as if to differentiate him from every other character--or to make him appear dumb or a lowlife. I don't know what it was all about, but it got to me after awhile.
As others have said, the poetry was irritating instead of inspiring. None of it seemed to apply until the last one at the end, which may be intentional. Again, I don't know. Tate did say he thought the poetry was weak.
The courtroom scenes were quite good. They, in fact, were what kept me reading to the end.
The back and forth between the years got really irritating and a little amateurish.
There was a brief passage written in second person before she went back to third person, and I wondered how an editor missed that.
That, and the rather silly romantic dialogue, became distractions. A shame, because Kya has such a beautiful story to tell.
And lastly, I'm glad I read the book before I read the reviews here, since so many readers decided to give the entire plot away. Why would anyone do that with a book that's essentially a murder mystery--emphasis on 'mystery'?",positive
241,Kindle Store,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.99,5,"Kya lives in the marshlands of North Carolina with her poverty stricken family. Her father is abusive and, one by one, her siblings leave and, eventually, so does her mother. Her father stays and he seems better for a time, even kind. Then he falls back into his old ways again and ends up leaving too. Kya tries school for a day but after being bullied, she doesn’t return. She makes it completely on her own and digs mussels to sell to the local store to bring in money for food. Tate, a boy a few years older than Kya, loves to explore the marsh. They become friends and he teaches her to read. With reading, she discovers and teaches herself to be literate and all about the marshlands and its nature. She illustrates and collects samples of everything she finds in her marsh area. Tate leaves to attend college and becomes a biologist and works in the marsh. He submits Kya’s illustrations and notes to a publisher and she becomes a published author several times over. She adds comforts to her house and lives well by her own wealth. She lives simply but she gets electricity and running water and other basic comforts that she's never had. When Tate went away to college, he realized that his life would be difficult for Kya. So, he doesn’t visit her for years. While he’s away, the local and popular Chase moves in on Kya. He tricks her into thinking he’s going to marry her, all the while dating other women. Kya eventually sees his engagement article in the local newspaper and ends it with him. Later, he attacks her, trying to rape her and he beats her up. She fights back and escapes. His body is found later and it looks like he fell from the fire tower in the marsh. Since he was a local celebrity, the police are pushed to investigate for foul play. Kya is arrested and faced with a murder trial. The whole time I’m reading the part after Chase attacks Kya, I’m hoping she killed him but I also don’t want her to be found guilty.

242,Kindle Store,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.99,3,"I'm an avid reader and tend to read more literary fiction by contemporary writers, or mystery fiction by British, Irish, and Scandinavian writers (a lot of American mystery series are very one dimensional).

Typically I find a lot of best sellers are pretty one dimension too, but they make for great Netflix or HBO series, or films (Big Little Lies, Sharp Objects, etc.). Anyway - I really didn't want to read this book because so many people liked it, but sometimes a great book ends up being a massive hit - Gone Girl was really good, The Midnight Library, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (I still love Scandinavian Crime Fiction thanks to this International hit).
But for some reason, the last few years, I kept putting this book in my cart, then taking it out, then reading reviews and putting it back in, then reading other reviews and taking it out. Needless to say, I was going to not ever read it, but my husband who doesn't typically read fiction but who loves the coast of our state - NC - wanted to read it. So we decided to read it together which was such a new and awesome experience. This is what is good and bad about the book in my opinion:

Good:
The description of the landscape. The author is a nonfiction / naturalist and zoologist / ecology writer, so she had amazing description of the animals, marshes, and coast. You could really get lost in these descriptions and this is probably the best thing about the book.

Kya - the protagonist - is a survivor and a character you root for because she's been treated so badly - by her family and everyone else. She's an interesting character in that her loneliness leads her to her passion for the marshes and coast, and as an introvert myself who would rather be alone than around people at times - I envied her isolated shack near the beach and her ability to just hang out exploring the coast all day.

Kya's friendship with Jumpin' and Mabel - they are both warm hearted characters who help Kya when she is young and are almost like adoptive parents to her, although they don't impede too much on her life. I liked their bond and thought it was plausible.

The metaphors the author uses between the animal / natural world and Kya's life / experiences. These were interesting, and definitely ""in your face"" as you were reading, but I learned things about the natural world I didn't know before and a few of the comparisons made me think which I always appreciate.

The bad:
The dialogue is not believable at all. Characters speak like they are living in the same Louisiana Parish as the characters from ""Steel Magnolias,"" and even though these are Southern folks who might be more isolated on the coast - and it's the 60s - no one speaks like this in NC (the accent). Also - characters always speak in full sentences to one another and explain their thoughts and feelings as if they are all very emotionally mature and well rounded people rather than broken and dysfunctional. Kya doesn't really speak like this most of the time, but everyone else does. People just don't speak like this to one another - in full sentences, and able to explain their thoughts and feelings so clearly - right in the moment. If this were the case, we would all be in a much more peaceful world. Communication is hard in the real world - especially when you are hurting and broken. The way the characters explain everything they are thinking so well and in full sentences makes the book kind of cheesy at times and almost like a YA read. This aspect of the book just didn't go with the landscape descriptions.

The love triangle:
It's pretty typical that in most popular books featuring a romance, you'll have the love triangle with the awkward yet beautiful chic in the middle - loved by two men. I understand it's value to drive suspense, but Tate and Chase both end up being kind of douches.

Things just don't make sense in a lot of ways:
No snakes in this book? Asheville as a destination from the Coast? No one in town trying harder to help this girl who everyone knows lives on her own? Some things just don't add up, including the mystery itself and why the Sheriff wants to pin it on Kya so much when his life would be easier if he just called it an accident as it looked to be anyway. I think she was capable enough of raising herself based on her ability to feed herself and the friends she made along the way, but she never really got hurt - other than the nail which doesn't seem plausible.

Overall - I'm looking forward to seeing the film because I absolutely love the landscape in this story and want to see Kya's shack and the way she interacts with nature which is the best thing about this story. The book was uneven to say the least, and it's certainly not going to be on the AP English literature reading list one day. But it has a protagonist that most people would love to root for, and the setting is great.

For a book featuring atmospheric natural landscape descriptions and interesting characters with unique experiences, as well as literary prose, I recommend Swamplandia by Karen Russell. It's set in the Everglades and captured my imagination in a way this story wasn't able to.",fair
243,Kindle Store,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.99,4,"The book that everyone is talking about - and I had to see for myself. Plus I wanted to see the movie, and whenever there’s a movie based on a book, I prefer reading the book first.

I loved the premise, a murder mystery, a historical coming of age story about a girl abandoned by her family and forced to rely only on herself living in the marsh, a celebration of nature, and the unique growing pains she goes through.

I enjoyed being on Kya’s journey with her and watching her grow from an abandoned, confused little girl to being a self-sufficient adult. It hurt to read about her getting hurt, but the few friends she makes along the way are true.

Not the biggest fan of the writing style, and the head hopping got a little confusing (though I don’t read much literary fiction so I don’t know if this is normal?) at times and I wasn’t a fan of the court scenes - felt jarring and out of place. It’s told in two timelines that eventually merge - one of Kya’s life, the other of the ongoing murder investigation of one of her ex-boyfriends, but markings of the year under each chapter prevents confusion.

Overall I’m glad she got her happy ending - though the end end throws in a twist I didn’t see coming. I’m looking forward to the movie!",positive
244,Kindle Store,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.99,5,"I love this book. I purchased it so I'd have something to read on vacation, and it was the perfect book to take.

From the first page, I got lost in the marshes of North Carolina, and the world in which the heroine Kya lives. Time jumps forward and back, but jumps perfectly to keep the stories past and current (1969) simultaneously moving to the climax. The stories kept me so enraptured that I literally stayed up half the night to finish it. I couldn't put the book down for anything. And I'm glad.

Crawdads felt very much like To Kill a Mockingbird. Simple time, southern home town, prejudice, murder, and a trial with a defense attorney similar to the beloved Atticus Finch. The descriptions of the people, town, marsh, and wildlife, make you feel as if you are there experiencing everything with the characters. And the story will keep you guessing until the end.

When I turned the last page, part of me was extremely disappointed only because I didn't want the story to end. It's a rare book that can pull me in so completely, and this one did just that. I just wanted to keep reading, and reading, and reading.

Order this book, and carve out a quiet space and time so you can immerse yourself. Get comfy with a box of Kleenex and prepare for a journey to the marshes of the South, back in the sixties before technology we enjoy today, when you could slow down long enough to feed the seagulls on the beach, and search for shells and feathers in the warm breeze of the North Carolina coast.",positive

I finished the series I had been reading yesterday and didn't know where to go from there but immediately thought of this book. I am SO glad I did!! This book has had me feeling so much in the last day and a half. At one point I felt so sad for Kya and then the next minute I would be so happy for her and then the next chapter I would be absolutely mad on her behalf or cursing her in my mind for wanting to see the good in someone who didn't deserve it. I am honestly sad for this story to be over but I am happy to say that every question that I had throughout this story was answered by the end of it and I really do feel like it all came together amazingly and allowed readers to not only glimpse Kya's life but experience every bit of it with her. I love this book. I will likely read a few other books and then come back to this again as I sometimes do with other stories that I've truly enjoyed. The details provided really help you paint a picture in your mind and allow you to feel like you're there with Kya, experiencing her marsh and nature through her eyes. 10/10 do recommend!",positive
246,Kindle Store,Real Bad Things,$4.99,4,"With the follow-up to her award-winning debut novel ""Cottonmouths,"" Kelly J. Ford has crafted a gritty and gravelly novel with unlikable characters doing unlikable things to and on behalf of one another. It's as if ""August: Osage County"" in deeper and darker ways with a thread of cyclical violence that seemingly impacts everyone who comes near it.

The setting is Maud Bottoms, Arkansas. Jane long ago escaped to Boston years after her confession to the murder of her stepfather Warren fell on deaf ears due to the absence of a body and no clear evidence that a crime had even occurred. However, a phone call from her long estranged mother Diane has revealed that Warren's body has been found and Jane has voluntarily returned home to face the consequences of her alleged long ago actions.

Jane's return home is met with abusive derision by her mother, wariness by her brother Jason, and a weird mixture of emotions by former girlfriend Georgia Lee.

Ford doesn't mess around here. There are no cathartic moments of healing to be found and no warm and fuzzy characters to toss light into this darkness. Instead, we get a relentlessly harrowing depiction of generational trauma and the lengths that some will go to in order to protect it and perpetuate it.

We also get the lengths some have to go to in order to simply survive it.

It's virtually impossible that ""Real Bad Things"" will be for everyone, though it hints of wildly popular authors like Gillian Flynn and Patricia Highsmith while forging a voice that is distinctly Kelly J. Ford. You may not like it, and I can even say I didn't, but you won't likely forget it.

The story centers around Jane's return to the town that made her and the people who mostly stayed and continued to be formed by it. Certain touches ring both absurd and true - from a smalltown gossip rag that makes the NextDoor app look like a Mister Rogers newsletter to local cops who are both incredibly inept and yet occasionally strike with precision and insight.

I suppose that Jane is the most sympathetic character, a woman in her 40's clearly formed by the traumas of her past and a woman whose inexplicable confession makes no sense even to those closest to her. She's abrasive and immensely flawed yet you can't help but think it's pretty miraculous she's even alive and functional.

Diane, on the other hand, is a ball of hate from the opening pages of ""Real Bad Things."" You sense that there's an ache somewhere deep inside her but the only way she soothes that ache is by inflicting the same level of ache on others.

Georgia Lee harbors her own secrets along with bitterness over Jane's sudden departure. Having grown up in a family where their worst fear seemed to be that the rumors about she and Jane were true, Georgia Lee's conflicted sense of self also masks a fiercely protective spirit.

Finally, there's Jason. In some ways, he's a pride of Diane and of Maud Bottoms, an MMA fighter who mostly keeps to himself and whose vulnerability draws out Jane's more maternal side.

Ford serves up a complex story here with twists and turns, some expected and some not so much. At times, the logic in ""Real Bad Things"" conflicts with itself there are mind-numbing choices made by nearly every character that seem almost too absurd to be true.

The ending, which I won't even hint of here, hurts not because it's entirely unexpected but because by the time you reach the final pages of ""Real Bad Things"" you've experienced the generational traumas these characters have gone through and you've realized that in some worlds happy endings simply don't exist.

Sometimes, things just end.

""Real Bad Things"" is an immersive, character-driven story that is relentless in its portrayal of smalltown noir, cyclical violence, and the lengths we go to in order to survive the lives we've been given. Ford's narrative is unforgiving and uncompromising with nary a feel-good moment to be found here in lives that are as bleak as the eye of a twister as it barrels down.

Emotionally honest and utterly devastating in its detail, ""Real Bad Things"" is proof positive that ""Cottonmouths"" was no fluke and Kelly J. Ford knows how to spin a seriously suspenseful and unforgettable tale.",positive
247,Kindle Store,Real Bad Things,$4.99,4,"The action in ""Real Bad Things,"" by Kelly J. Ford, starts when the body of a man missing for twenty-five years is found in the lock of a dam. Immediately, three girls and one boy now in their 40s become nervous that their role in the man's demise and coverup may be revealed. Teenagers do stupid things that can come back to haunt them. Any adult reading the story will see how it could have been handled at the time to result in an almost happy ending for all four teens. Instead, the least culpable girl, Jane, had confessed all those years ago, but after serving a brief stint in juvenile detention was released for lack of evidence (no body) and left town to separate from her monster of a mother, Diane, friend Angie, brother Jason, and love interest Georgia Lee. The discovery of the body brings Jane back to town and casts her into the orbit of her family and former friends. What I liked most about this book were the beginning and the end. The shocking jumpstart of the book had me hoping to race to the revelation of the true facts. Who really killed Warren (Jane's abusive stepfather)? The ending was equally satisfying, as even though I was expecting a twist, what transpired was not even close to what I had imagined. I got a little tired of the F bombs, but the people in the fictional town of Maud most likely really would talk that way. I was exasperated that the former teens now as adults reverted to their childlish thinking and ways. Teenage angst dominated the pages as the characters repeatedly, almost ad nauseum, had thoughts such as, ""Is she mad at me?""; ""Why doesn't she text me back?""; ""Does she think I did it?""; ""Does she love me?""; etc. But with these particular characters, the traumatic discovery of the body had the potential to land each and every one of them in serious trouble, so the fact that it might resurrect their immaturity is not unbelievable. Reading about the different paths the characters had taken in life, the startling beginning, and the explosive ending made this book a 4 for me despite my few criticisms.",positive
248,Kindle Store,Real Bad Things,$4.99,4,"I’ve never read the author before – this was my first read from her, but definitely not my last!

The author knows how to build characters. I felt like I knew each and every one of them. They aren’t sweet and pretty, but they have depth and manage to live and breathe on the page. She also has a deft hand with setting. I’ve never been to Arkansas and I’ll admit that my knowledge of the state is woefully sparse. I loved learning a little more about it and having some of my prior impressions turned upside down!

Our mystery itself surprised me. At first, I thought it was a rather simple one. Nope. There are some wonderfully dark and unexpected things about this one!

I did find myself wishing our main character had made a very different decision in the end. It’s probably a good sign that I was so disappointed in her – it meant that I was feeling her so much and wanted her to end up right.

256,Kindle Store,Fling,$3.99,5,"I absolutely loved Fling by Adriana Locke; it is an incredible friends-to-lovers love story. It is the second book in her Carmichael Family series. Adriana Locke continues to prove that she is an amazing storyteller. I could not put Fling down and I loved moment on every page. Who does not love hot sexy men, strong females, loving families, and friends, who always support one another? I really enjoy how the book is told in the first person from perspective of the main characters. I love getting the insight and feelings from the different characters. My favorite part of the book is how Adriana Locke incorporates the title of the book and the picture on the cover into the love story. Fling is friends-to-lovers love story and is filled with heartbreaking and heartwarming moments. I love the lighter moments where I find myself smiling and laughing out loud. My favorite moments are the ones that pull at my heartstrings that cause me to sigh, as I read the heartbreaking moments. Fling is filled with such moments, and with so much emotion. It is filled with all those things that we have come to love and expect in a love story, Adriana Locke did not disappoint, especially with the poignant and bittersweet moments that filled this page turner. Fling is the story of Maddox Carmichael, owner of his own real estate company and Ashley Thompson, owner of her own travel agency. Ashley and Maddox met in the first grade and have been best friends ever since. Ashley returns to her hometown of Kismet Beach from Orlando, following her broken engagement to Eton Eldridge. Ashley decides to go on the honeymoon to the Bahamas that she already paid for. Her friends Becca and Sara convince her to have a contest to find a guy to take with her on her honeymoon. They post an ad on Social, a social media platform the applicants who wish to join Ashley must apply and Sara and Becca will decide on her date. Ashley does not find out the identity of her date until she is on the airplane. Both Maddox and Ashley are concerned about what happens to their friendship following their vacation. I love the chemistry between Ashley and Maddox. Conversation between Ashley and Maddox flows so easily, I love that both Ashley and Maddox share secrets with one another that they have not shared with anyone before, especially the secrets that they Ashley shares about her father. Ashley suffers from insecurities because of her relationship with her late father and is hoping to find someone who will love her as she is and is looking for forever love. Maddox on the other hand is not looking for a relationship and has only been interested in flings. I love Maddox calls Ashley, Birdie. As Ashley and Maddox spend time together on her honeymoon in the Bahamas, things change between them, neither one is willing to admit their true feelings for one another. Some of their conversations between Ashley and Maddox are truly heartbreaking. I love everything that Maddox does for Ashley, especially the two rings that he has given him, and the significance of her engagement ring. A heart-breaking surprise plot twist occurs after Ashley and Maddox return from their trip, which changes everything between Ashley and Maddox. I love the heart-to-heart conversation that Ashley has with mother, and the heart-to-heart conversation that Maddox has with his mother and brothers following his breakup with Ashley. I loved that Fling is a more than just a romance, there are issues that both Ashley and Maddox are facing that need to be resolved. I love how the storylines get so beautifully resolved. I love how the epilogue is the perfect ending to their love story. Fling is filled with poignant and bittersweet moments as well as plot twists. I love the characters and the family dynamic in Fling the characters feel like family and friends. I enjoyed all the interactions between the Carmichael siblings, it feels like real family love and makes me laugh at their teasing, especially all the pranks that Banks plays on his brothers. I loved all the characters in Fling, and I am looking forward to reading the other books in the series. Who does not love family and friends that always have each other’s backs? I thoroughly enjoyed Fling, who does not love a friends-to-lovers love story. Highly recommend this incredible love story and am so looking forward to reading the other books in the series.",positive
257,Kindle Store,Fling,$3.99,5,"Somehow I missed Flirt and will read it next, but this is the best book I have read by Mrs. Locke. It is funny and sexy and sweet. Maddox Carmichael ranks pretty high up there as a book boyfriend. The things he says to her are beyond swoon worthy. They've known each other since first grade when he cut bubble gum out of her hair with safety scissors to keep her from getting in trouble for having gum in the first place.

Their trip, her honeymoon, is perfect but short. I went to Nassau with my family. We might have done the swimming with pigs thing if we had known that was a thing, if it is a real thing, that is.

I don't give many 5 star reviews. I read almost a book a day and only give 1 or 2 five star reviews a month unless I find a really great series. I hold out for those books that make me smile from start to finish and make me want to tell everyone they need to read the book. This one did just that. A big help were the pranks between the brothers. Banks and Jess both pull really good ones on each other.

Their ribbing, teasing and general annoying each other are par for the course but the practical jokes are certainly heating up. (And they're so hilarious I actually sent quotes to a couple of friends.) Unfortunately, or probably fortunately, Maddox pretty much sits this one out because he's otherwise occupied. With his best friend. Since first grade.

Ashley Thompson is back home in Kismet Beach after a failed engagement, with a paid-for honeymoon getaway awaiting and no one to share it with. She’s questioning everything she thought she knew about men. All men. Except Maddox, who's been her steadfast, charming, flirty friend for as long as she can remember.

Friends to lovers is always fun, but Mad and Ashley take it to a whole new level, and no one is more surprised by Mad's protective instincts towards Ashley than Maddox, himself. They have some difficult waters to navigate as they try to turn a lifelong friendship into something more.

This one will make you blush, squeeze your heart in the most exquisite ways, and leave your laughing muscles sore. You can probably blame the youngest brother, Banks, for the last one, but more on him another time. If you’re looking for a fun, heartfelt read to take you away and make you fall effortlessly in love, run to the 1-Click now.

Fling is Maddox and Ashley’s story! Childhood friends who as adults now harbor some very unfriend-like feelings for each other. The chemistry simmering between the two led to a combustion that was a long time coming. I really enjoyed watching them take their friendship to the next level. I loved their cute and playful banter!
Let me tell you, Adriana did not hold back with the spice. I think my favorite part was seeing how much dirty talk came from my girl Ashley. Yes, Maddox was whispering all the right panty melting things I absolutely love. But, I was not ready for Ashley. I was like whoa, hello, yes girl you better tell him! I lived for her confidence.
These two tried to fight their feelings but thankfully didn’t take too long before they came to their senses. I loved that there were no games played between them.

This is the second book in the Carmichael Family series. It is a standalone romance with a friends-to-lovers storyline. Maddox, for all his “I’m better as a Fling” bravado, was such a sweetheart. The way he takes care of others, protects his family, and will do anything for Ashley is just perfect. Ashley is getting her life back together, but the way she was so enamored with Maddox, but still managed to give as good as she got with him was so amazing to read.

266,Kindle Store,Where the Sky Begins: A Novel,$5.99,5,"one of the genre’s queens.

After being a bit disappointed with RB’s last novel, I am all kinds of happy with this one. Protagonist, Josie, is a character that is down to earth, big hearted, learns from her mistakes, has a finely tuned sense on right and wrong and she was a joy to cheer for while reading.

As always, Bowen is a wizard at descriptive prose. The dichotomy of war torn London streets and fresh, hopeful country fields come alive under her pen. Disparity of locations are united by common threads of pain and loss with hope for future tomorrows at the end of the war. Bowen’s writing draws us into the city or country to smell, feel, taste and hear all the details so effortlessly described.

Besides Josie, there are a large cast of characters: her husband, Stan, blue collar and rough, not much love in their relationship; Mike is an RAF pilot and squadron leader, possibly the love of her life who’s got a BIG secret; Dr. Jakob, 12 years her senior, Jewish and has strong feelings for her that she’s trying hard not to encourage; these are her love interests.

Additionally, there are all the townspeople, the very upper crust owner of the “big house” she lives in, her servant, a contingency of Air Force guys, her husband’s sister and husband and a few others that come along near the end involved after solving a mystery. Oh yeah, RB most always manages to toss a mystery or two into her books and both of these are pretty good.

It captures the social dynamics in a world that is changing faster than the people in that time and place can fathom. The class lines are breaking down out of necessity. But, love can not always be predictable.

There were some storylines that were a bit perfunctory, which if fleshed out could have added to the richness of the story. the elderly woman's character so quickly succumbing to the protagonist's speculation seemed merely a device to move the story forward. If done with the benefit of more bonding or background, might have added to the story. Just a minor point, as by that point in the story her role was not central to the plot.

276,Kindle Store,Klara and the Sun: A novel,$13.99,5,"This was my first book by Nobel Prize winner Kazuo Ishiguro and I plan to read more, starting with Never Let Me Go. I really liked Klara and the Sun and it lends well to great discussion. This was a #BookeroftheMonth read and everyone in the chat had so many insightful thoughts and ideas that gave me an even greater appreciation and understanding of this work.

This is a literary fiction novel with some sci-fi aspects. Something that the club discussed was that in a traditional sci-fi, there would be more focus on world building while this is more about the characters and ideas. We are thrown into the world of this novel without being given all the information. I was impressed by how well reveals are made and how every piece comes together. There are some parts (such as what exactly “lifting” is) that I still don’t fully understand and I believe this book would also be a good one to reread sometime.

Our narrator here is Klara, an Artificial Friend (essentially a robot). Through her non-human perspective, we wrestle with what it really means to be human. In one scene, a person refers to Klara as a machine and it was a jarring moment for me as a reader because I had really become attached to her and she felt like a person, so it was weird to remember that she really wasn’t and that there would be many in this world who just viewed her as a machine to serve its purpose. I don’t want to give specifics to avoid spoilers but are several other moments that further illuminate that idea.

The only negative to this book for me was something that happened near the end that felt like a copout (as someone in the club described it) to me. I was expecting the story to go a different direction. I’m being purposefully vague here but if you’ve read this, feel free to message me.

I really liked this and so far it’s my favorite of what I’ve read from the Booker list. Let me know if you’ve read this and how you felt about it, or if you’ve read any other Ishiguro.",positive
277,Kindle Store,Klara and the Sun: A novel,$13.99,3,"In an interview to Waterstones, Kazuo Ishiguro commented that the seed of Klara and the Sun was a story for a children's book he had in mind but that was too dark to be published as such (it would traumatize kids, his daughter warned him). That makes total sense to me. There is a delicate fairytale quality in this novel that permeates Klara's voice as the narrator. Not only because of its main theme but also the way the affective relationships are built (the way Chrissie and Josie, Josie and Klara, Chrissie and Klara and Klara and Ricky are bound), there is some significant thematic overlap with AI: Artificial Intelligence (more the Spielberg's part than Kubrick's) and, tangentially, Pinnochio_.

Even though the story of KS_ is told by a robot, this is a novel where the whole idea of humanity and human subjectivity is put at the center, and brought up with a very fresh look. It is a study about illness, love, tenderness, faith, all interpreted or acted upon by a being that is not human (or maybe, as the Tyrrell Corporation used to say, ""more human than human""), but a very intelligent and sensitive one. Ishiguro says that having an AI as the narrator allowed him to explore all these human themes with a fresh look, making basic questions about humanity a human being would never ask. Indeed, the story told by a robot brings a very distinct flavor to the narrative. Everything is familiar, but at the same time seems strange through Klara's sometimes childish or naïve (however precise) descriptions of what she sees and witnesses. It is as if a very intelligent and sensitive alien came to Earth to observe us, with sharp eyes but no context.

KS also brought me good memories about Never Let Me Go, specially the kind of decency and tenderness that Ishiguro masterfully embeds into the action and reactions of his (mostly tragic) characters. There is a strangely self-contained, humble quality but tense underneath Ishiguro's writing which I'm personally fond of, and that also shows in Klara's narrative. There are also many thematic parallels, not only about human genetics, and genetic editing, but also in the way beings (be them clones or robots) are treated as things. Part of the genetic editing subplot in KS (concerning Josie's and Rick's differences) is actually suggested in NLMG when Miss Emily speaks about the Morningdale scandal, dr James Morningdale's offering the possibility of having children with enhanced characteristics. The parallel between Kathy being a carer in NLMG and Klara's looking after Josie in KS was particularly strong to me, more so in the second act. Ishiguro admits KS is in many ways a companion book to NLMG, but with a more positive resolution, a brighter response to the bleak, sad ending of his previous book. In NLMG, when Kathy and Tommy seek Madame Marie-Claude and Miss Emily of Hailsham to ask for a deferral of Tommy's donation because of their true love, we as the reader lose all hope. In KS Klara keeps her hope on the powers of the Sun with the devotion of a religious human being that contagiously keep us believing as well.

KS_ is a fairytale of the modern times, dealing, as any fairytale, with the anxieties of its era: machines taking the place of humans, substitutions, replacements, misplacements; how far can science go to remove any illusion of divinity or uniqueness of the human kind: Will AI prove that there is nothing special about us? The novel constantly raises questions about our own individuality: what if our professional career is suddenly terminated and all our experience and knowledge become suddenly obsolete? Does the meaning of our lives evaporate as well? What if everything that defines us as a human being can be reduced to a finite (however gigantic and complex) number of brain connections, like a finite number of rooms within rooms within rooms? Will we be able to store all this connections somewhere outside our brain or, worse, synthetically replicate it?

I confess I was a little abated by the final act, which seemed to me a little outplaced, if not ‘disposable’. But as I let the book settle, it now seems to me that the book ends with an interesting meta-image of Klara’s own condition. After listening to Ishiguro reinforcing the idea that Klara's main purpose as a commercial product is to reduce the tension of teenagers with loneliness, and that she is programmed to identify and treat human loneliness, her own aging and destiny gains a different color, especially because it mimics Klara's own surprise when she discovered that Rick's mother Helen was open to live alone if that would secure a better future for his son. Maybe it is Ishiguro’s Japanese blood speaking, with reminiscences of The Ballad of Narayama, or maybe it is just the emotional touch Ishiguro plays so well. In any event, this is a touching little story that, while not as impactful as NLMG, I will hold to heart.",fair
278,Kindle Store,Klara and the Sun: A novel,$13.99,4,"This is the first book by this author that I have read. I think the translation and the intentional AF point of view gave the novel a great deal of verisimilitude. The risks of technology, i.e., gene therapy, AI, universal stipends, etc., are clearly shown. I could not read this for very long at a time. 25 pages here and there until the end. I would not say I enjoyed it. I did appreciate it. A sign of our times.",positive
279,Kindle Store,Klara and the Sun: A novel,$13.99,4,"This is the first book I have read by Kazuo Ishiguro. And according to the professional reviewers one of his common themes is the exploration of what it means to be human, which love is a big part of. And this book certainly fits.

The narrator is a robot named Klara, an AF (artificial friend) meant to be a companion to a teenage girl named Josie. The story takes place in the future, of course, but that future is not very clearly defined. There is a reference to massive social upheaval caused by the advancement of AI, a predictable backlash from the humans who are disaffected, and the implication of anarchy. There is even a specific reference to fascism.

But the whole book is a series of references. The writing is very clean and you can read the book in a relatively short period of time. Definitely not a slog. But many questions go unanswered and vague is a defining characteristic. In many ways, in fact, both the writing style and the reliance on vague implication often made me think of Eastern poetry (I am a fan) in narrative form.

As other reviewers have noted, the book leaves you with an overall sense of sadness, but I would call it emptiness because it is more of a perspective than an emotion. It just is, which is largely the way Klara sees and experiences the world.

Having given it much thought over the years, it is very doubtful to me that artificial people will develop along the path that Klara is on. She is genuinely advanced in some areas but rudimentary in others. There is a whiff of consciousness. Klara picks up on innuendo and interprets her observations in ways suggestive of the most observant and sensitive of humans, but has a very limited knowledge of the larger world. She doesn’t, for example, understand the purpose of the simplest machines.

There is a great deal of ink devoted to how Klara sees the world. It often involves geometric shapes and the deception of angle, point of view, and lighting. That, however, is never fully linked to the main narrative.

The human characters are not developed in depth, more as a matter of style, I think, than oversight. And there are many storylines that are never quite filled in, again, I think, due to matters of style.

The mother presents the most complex and inscrutable character to me. We are often presented with somewhat lengthy narratives that are just left in total isolation. Often contradictory, these dialogues are never fully explained or again referenced as the narrative unfolds.

In the end, the author’s perspective on what it means to be human is vague, like the book itself. The basic question seems to be whether or not humans have an inexplicable dimension that will never be replicated artificially or are predictable in a way we may not yet understand, but which there is a knowable pattern to.

I, for one, believe it will be decades before robots are even remotely human. They will do amazing things and will learn much more than we can individually know. That, however, is where we live, not what we know and feel.

One of the reasons for that is that artificial intelligence is incapable of making mistakes. It can clearly be wrong and make terrible choices. That, however, is the fault of the person creating the artificial intelligence, not the intelligence itself. And that is exactly why we must be so careful in pursuing a future dominated by AI. Humans are more than capable of making mistakes, even ones that will ultimately destroy us.

In the end, I will probably buy another one of this author’s books. I will wait a while, however. I need to fully digest this one first. That, in the end, is my standard of a good book.",positive
280,Kindle Store,Klara and the Sun: A novel,$13.99,3,"I hated this novel. I simply couldn’t see the point. But the author was a Nobel Prize-winner, so I kept slogging away to the very end. I’d figured there must be something worthy in it. After all, one of the world’s most celebrated authors had turned his attention to the subject of artificial intelligence. He’d written a science fiction novel! To find out what other readers might see in the book, I turned to the (predictably) gushing reviews of the establishment’s literary critics.

** Maureen Corrigan of NPR, for example. She calls “Klara and the Sun a masterpiece that will make you think about life, mortality, the saving grace of love: in short, the all of it.” Really? It’s a story about a robot and sickly fourteen-year-old girl, neither of whom is the least bit interesting.

** And Radhika Jones, the editor in chief of Vanity Fair, devotes 1,400 words to her review for the New York Times. She concludes that the novel “strikes the quintessential Ishiguro chord.” Whatever that means.

** But the unidentified reviewer for KIrkus terms Klara and the Sun “A haunting fable of a lonely, moribund world that is entirely too plausible.” OK, that’s closer to the mark. But I still hated the book, Nobel Prize-winner or not.

A worthy job of world-building

So, for the record, Ishiguro does write well. (Of course. How could we expect anything else after that Nobel Prize?) And there are things about Klara and the Sun that ARE interesting. Because Ishiguro does a respectable job of world-building. If you have the patience to wait him out to get the full picture.

Robots

Klara is a humanoid robot manufactured and sold as an “Artificial Friend,” or “AF.” (Awful name.) She is solar-powered and craves the comfort of sunlight. Unaccountably, however, she personifies the sun (“the Sun”), endowing it with intentionality and the ability to help or harm individual human beings. (As though any self-respecting coder would program an artificial intelligence to believe such nonsense!)

The novel is set in the near future, but it’s barely recognizable. Robots have replaced human beings at nearly every task, and the consequences are predictable. Widespread poverty. Desperation. Riots in the cities. They’re all in the background.

Increased inequality

Class differences are pronounced. Klara observes sharp distinctions in behavior and dress between those who are “high-ranked” and others who aren’t. (You’d think a Nobel Prize-winner could come up with a better label than “high-ranked.”)

Genetic enhancement

With genetic editing, which goes by the unexplained acronym AGE, children are “lifted.” Presumably, this means they’re endowed with exceptional abilities. But some pay a heavy price for this. In Klara and the Sun, the girl for whom Klara becomes an “Artificial Friend,” is mysteriously ill. Apparently, this is the consequence of having been lifted. And her sister had died in a similar manner.

Josie, Klara’s “friend,” is enrolled with tutors online on her “oblong.” (Another unlikely label.) Josie may be isolated at home because of her illness. Or maybe all the schools are closed. It’s never clear. But other children are stuck at home, too, because their parents have to arrange “interaction meetings” for them to learn how to relate to one another. (“The kids who don’t do well in college are always the ones who didn’t attend enough meetings.”) And the universities are now largely limited to the “lifted.” It seems that unlifted children can’t be expected to compete with those who have gained advantages through AGE.

This scenario comes into focus only in the course of the novel’s more than 200 pages. Ishiguro dribbles out the details, which added to my frustration in reading the book. I expected much more from a Nobel Prize-winner.

Enough said. If you trust Jennifer Corrigan or Radhika Jones more than me, read the book, by all means. If not, I suggest you find something else to occupy your time.

281,Kindle Store,Klara and the Sun: A novel,$13.99,5,I loved the character development. I Loved the idea the AF was innocently and compassionately willing to be used to do the immoral act they wanted her to accomplish. I wanted more about the son and how or why it did what it did. There was quite a suspense regarding Klara being groomed to become her owner. I am hoping for a sequel.,positive
282,Kindle Store,Klara and the Sun: A novel,$13.99,5,"This was the first book, for me, in a long time that I was infatuated with from the first paragraph. I was at once hooked by the dissociated yet curious prose presented by our titular character and narrator, who lived her artificial life as a witness, and eventually an actor, to the world around her. The story did a great job presenting its own world and rules in a semi-mysterious manner, presenting terms like ‘AF’ and ‘lifted’ and giving just enough context, if not in the first encounter then in the second or fifth, for the reader to understand the term’s meaning to the tale.
To me, this story portrays a growing appreciation of life, an appreciation that is more easily witnessed in a being who has yet to witness or experience life. And after a time spent experiencing such life, the witness will only wish to use what knowledge they spent so long acquiring to change their world for the better. I honestly expected the story to take the path of the endless witness, having Klara venture around the world of her book, learning little things about what makes life important to those around her, understanding how the world around her works. Instead, I was presented with a more grounded, a less vagabond, tale; and I was nonetheless satisfied.
Klara and the Sun is a fine piece of science fiction, a truly heartwarming tale about ingratiating oneself with the people around you and doing all in your power to ensure their happiness and prosperity. I truly look forward to rereading this book years down the line.",positive

284,Kindle Store,Klara and the Sun: A novel,$13.99,4,"This is an unusual and skillfully written novel, which starts off as if you are joining a conversation mid-way. There is a fully realized world that is both recognizable and slightly off, relatable and alien. Nature, humanity and technology coexist in an uneasy state and parents make life-changing decisions to give their children any advantage in society. This is a world in which people struggle to find, cultivate and maintain connection with each other.
The story is told in the first person by Klara, an Artificial Friend intended to be a robot companion for children. Her voice is clear as she observes everything around her and attempts to put each insight into context with her given purpose. Because the author does not share all the details of this world directly with the reader, we observe it and learn about it just as Klara does. By the end of the book, we can infer many things about this slightly futuristic world but there are also things which are left unexplained—they just are, whether or not we understand them. Some readers will likely be put off by not having full insight into the world of the story, but others may find the sensation of exploring a new landscape to be an intriguing bonus to the story.
Klara’s growing relationship with her child, Josie, brings her purpose into focus as she tries to understand the mysteries of the human heart and human interactions and use that knowledge to help and protect Josie. Klara’s observations lead her to actions that are surprising and profoundly human in their intention, and the feeling of hope remains as a guiding light for Klara and all the humans in her sphere, much as the light from the Sun of the title plays a prominent role in the novel. Readers who like the premise of this novel will find themselves thinking about it for a long time afterwards.",positive
285,Kindle Store,Klara and the Sun: A novel,$13.99,4,"The Klara is the title is an artificial friend or, if you will, a robot engineered to look an act like a human being with actual intelligence and feelings.

At the beginning of the novel, Klara is housed in a store that sells artificial friends. Her main ambition, besides being purchased, is to get as close to the Sun as possible. The Sun’s rays reach into the store, but if she’s placed towards the rear they don’t reach her. The ideal place is in the window. When she finally reaches that goal, a girl named Josie talks to her and promises to come back with her mother and buy Klara. Josie doesn’t show up. Klara has a friend, another AF named Rosa, who is purchased before she is. The manager of the store is another ally. She tries to keep the artificial friends happy. Ultimately Josie does keep her promise, bringing her mother to meet Klara. She says she was sick and couldn’t get there any sooner, which is a foreshadowing device.

In order to understand what’s happening the reader needs to know a few things. Klara loves the Sun so much because she is solar enhanced. There is also the term “lifted” that’s used to describe Josie’s friends. Most people have heard the term CRISPR which is gene modification. As a science fiction novel, it appears that Josie and her friends have undergone gene modification which makes them more intelligent. Josie’s boyfriend, Rick, has not been lifted and is looked down upon by her friends. As the plot moves along we learn that Josie isn’t well; she’s already lost an older sister. Her mother and father have an ulterior motive in purchasing Klara. Klara is very intelligent. They think they she may be able to replace Josie if she’s around her often enough to be able to mime her personality. The inference is that the genetic alteration made the older sister sick, and it’s having the same effect on Josie. Klara sets out to save Josie by making a compact with the Sun.

The ending is a real downer; it has to do with the way people treat the artificial friends once they’re done with them. I haven’t been much of a science fiction fan until lately. I’ve read two in the last couple of months. This one raises some valid questions about science, and it’s not that robots are going to become too powerful and ultimately replace us.",positive

Once you think they have their happily ever after they get hit with a tragedy that has Silas spending years looking for her. When he finally fines her something is off causing him to have to win her back.

I gotta say I loved that there was a fued between the brothers. I don't think I've read this plot in a book before. My heartbroke for Alanna and Silas. They had so many obstacles go through. I loved how she wouldn't admit it but she would go crazy possessive over Silas. Hell, i enjoyed her psychotic ways throughout the book! The way Silas never gave up was beautiful and heartshattering at the same time. Oh the angst that I felt in certain moments actually hurt. But it was made up with the laughter, steam, and love they had for eachother. They was a moment in the book that had me grinning and laughing so hard.

You know that magical moment when you realize you’ve just read a book that will stay with you forever? That moment where you realize that you’ve come to love the characters so much that their pain is yours and you find yourself crying because they hurt and laughing when they laugh?! This book is one of those for me. I promise you there are twists that you will NEVER see coming but you will never forget. This book was such an emotional and wild ride for me and I loved every second of it. The angsty is SO perfectly and beautifully written.

It has most certainly become one of my favorites and I will definitely read it again!",positive

I wanted to give this five stars this is a give star book, except for two things I couldn't get passed the whole Raven situation that he went to dinner with her after sleeping with his Ray. I felt like if he and Raven had a fake relationship but never slept together I would've felt better about it and 5 years was too long to be apart.

Also the blub didn't accurately fit the book only half of it. But overall this was a good well written story that breaks your heart over and over.",positive
