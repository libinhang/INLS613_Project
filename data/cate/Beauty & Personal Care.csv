0,Beauty & Personal Care,essence | Lash Princess False Effect Mascara Gluten & Cruelty Free Pack of 3,$4.42 - $17.98,5,"Okay, look. I am 27 years old. I have been wearing mascara for a long time. Probably fifteen years or something. I have short, straight lashes that get tangled together, and the top ones tangle into the bottom ones. I have tried everything short of super high end mascara because I am CHEAP and I don't want to waste money on it if it's going to be something else that doesn't work. I can't use the plastic wands because they do nothing for my aforementioned wonky lashes. It quite literally looks like I haven't bothered putting anything on. So when this when on sale on Prime Day and my mom recommended it, I figured I might as well give it a shot. I had nothing to lose except a few dollars because I had no hope left.

Well, butter my buns and call me a biscuit, because I was so pleasantly surprised by this mascara. It separates my lashes where they tangle without getting all over my lid, which is another problem I run into. It doesn't smudge easily and doesn't run in the rain or when I sweat or get teary (I live in Alabama and I am a weepy gal, so you can imagine this is a huge feat). My lashes look, well, like they exist after one coat, and with two or three, they're separated, not clumpy, thick, and long. Like I said, I've used dozens of mascaras at various price points, and I really think this is the best one.

I do recommend using the primer that goes with it if you have shorter, thinner, or blonder lashes like mine. It's good alone, but I definitely see a difference using it together. It's one of the better primers I've used as well. It dries quickly, but doesn't get so crunchy you can't put mascara on top easily, and again, doesn't make my lashes tangled, which is just such a huge deal for me, I truly cannot express to you.

If you're on the fence, get it. It's absolutely worth the price, and might be the best one you've tried!",positive
1,Beauty & Personal Care,essence | Lash Princess False Effect Mascara Gluten & Cruelty Free Pack of 3,$4.42 - $17.98,4,"I came across these two and wondered which one was best.. so I ordered both Essence 'False Lash Effect' & Essence 'Curl & Volume' mascara and compared the two. They actually had similar results. Neither seemed to smudge or clump. The brushes of each were different though. The brush of this one seemed to really separate & lengthen each lash but it took two coats of this one to achieve almost the same result as the 'Curl & Volume' mascara one coat. So I prefer the Curl & Volume one.. It seemed to go on alot quicker for me and I liked the thicker brush of it better tooüëçBut that is just my preference...‚ò∫

I like that these mascaras arrive in factory sealed plastic ensuring they are unused. This mascara is not waterproof and I noticed that a little more was involved in removing it than other mascaras.
They do offer a waterproof mascara for any who may need it.
I read that this mascara does not need a primer for those who use primers.
They are labeled as vegan.. but one of the ingredients is beeswax for those who want to know. Here's a full list of ingredients...

Ingredients: Aqua (Water), Cera Alba (Beeswax), Paraffin, Glyceryl Stearate, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Wax, Butylene Glycol, Palmitic Acid, Acacia Senegal Gum, Polybutene, Aminomethyl Propanol, Stearic Acid, Carnauba (Copernicia Cerifera) Wax, VP / Eicosene Copolymer, Dimethicone, Polyester-4, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, CI 77499 (Iron Oxides)

Overall, I prefer the Essence 'Curl & Volume' but this one works great too just took longer as it required 2 coats for me. Also, remember it takes a little more effort to remove. Besides that I'd say it's a good mascara for the money.

UPDATE:(8/2/22) Since both of these mascaras were harder for me to remove than my previous ones and it felt like an oily film was left on my face, I have went back to using my other mascara that is a more natural brand oneüòÅ While I still think these are good quality mascaras, I just needed something easier and that didn't leave the oily residue feeling on my skin.. but if you have a good quality eye makeup remover then you will probably LOVE this mascaraüëç
Hope this review helps youü§ó‚ò∫",positive
2,Beauty & Personal Care,essence | Lash Princess False Effect Mascara Gluten & Cruelty Free Pack of 3,$4.42 - $17.98,5,"I love the Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effects mascara. It‚Äôs wonderful! Prior to trying this brand I was a committed Maybelline fan, having tried and used religiously all of their mascara formulas. I even did a short run in using designer brands like Diorshow Blackout (before they changed the formula) .But since trying Essence lash, for about a year now, I am sold on both the quality and price. You‚Äôll love the thickness of the formula which allows you to get fullness and length without having to layer coat after coat. In addition the brush is great which makes application smooth. I won‚Äôt be going back since finding this ‚Äúgem.‚Äù Try it you won‚Äôt be disappointed. It‚Äôs very few times these days when you can get a quality product for a reasonable price.",positive
3,Beauty & Personal Care,essence | Lash Princess False Effect Mascara Gluten & Cruelty Free Pack of 3,$4.42 - $17.98,5,"I bought this on a whim after seeing my influencer friend post about it. It was only a couple of bucks so I thought ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù

Totally blown away. It‚Äôs been the best mascara I‚Äôve used in years and I‚Äôve only bought high end, overpriced, overhyped mascara since 2015. This one has completely taken over their space in my makeup bag and I‚Äôll be ordering again and again.

Only downside is how NOT water proof it is, but like whatever. Just buy the waterproof version for a couple more bucks to keep with it in case you feel like crying in the bathroom at work that day. (Guilty)

Just buy the thing, it‚Äôs only a few bucks, if you hate it (you won‚Äôt) oh well. But chances are you‚Äôll be replacing your Sephora special for this one in no time.",positive
4,Beauty & Personal Care,essence | Lash Princess False Effect Mascara Gluten & Cruelty Free Pack of 3,$4.42 - $17.98,5,"I've been attempting to find mascara that doesn't clump or flake and had tried at least a dozen from several drugstore brands. Based on all the positive reviews I read about this product and its very reasonable price, I had to try it. I'm quite impressed with how well it goes on without clumping, that it doesn't flake and is easy to take off with my usual makeup remover towelettes.

I know my lashes are long when I look up and they touch above my eyelid. It took three coats of this mascara to get them that long, but it works!

I highly recommend you try this product!",positive
5,Beauty & Personal Care,essence | Lash Princess False Effect Mascara Gluten & Cruelty Free Pack of 3,$4.42 - $17.98,5,"I have very blonde, straight lashes. They aren‚Äôt super short but they aren‚Äôt very voluminous. I bought this and the lash primer. I use my eyelash curler first, then a coat of the primer and then two coats of the mascara and it makes my eyelashes so long! It gives them volume and the curl stays all day. My eyelashes look so good and for the price you can‚Äôt beat it! I also love Benefit Bang mascara but it is pricey so I thought I would give it a try. So far, I am loving it!
It is not flakey, no clumps. The wand is a nice shape and size and easy to use. It comes off with cleanser or micellar water very easily, no tugging or pulling on lashes.
Give it a try and see how you like it. I was not disappointed and I am very picky about mascara.",positive
6,Beauty & Personal Care,essence | Lash Princess False Effect Mascara Gluten & Cruelty Free Pack of 3,$4.42 - $17.98,4,This mascara used to be a 10 out of 10 and for the price Whopper!!! The last three tubes I have bought are not as wet as they used to be and even dry clumps come out when I first buy it. I am very disappointed if they change this formula!!! It was much better the original way it was processed I could get incredible length and thickness and now it's limited with the dryness of the tube. I hope they go back to the original formula making it nice and wet the way it should be! If it's not broken don't fix it!,positive
7,Beauty & Personal Care,essence | Lash Princess False Effect Mascara Gluten & Cruelty Free Pack of 3,$4.42 - $17.98,5,"I see what the hype is about, FOR SURE! Is it my favorite? It's one of them for sure! Excellent product! What sells me, is finally a good priced mascara that is NOT junk. It goes on smooth, no flake, and added a ton of length/volume to my pretty badly beat down lashes from constant falsie wear. The amount you get is good for the price, so you can not go wrong buying all 3 kinds they offer for sure and use it as a staple every day mascara. Did not flake..however ONLY flaw I found so far...washes off too easy, like I don't know where it's going but at the end of the night...it's gone on the bottom lashes pretty much but no black smudge or flake so It's a mystery LOL",positive
8,Beauty & Personal Care,essence | Lash Princess False Effect Mascara Gluten & Cruelty Free Pack of 3,$4.42 - $17.98,5,This is the first review I‚Äôve ever made because I am in shock!! & Excuse my no-makeup face! My eyelashes are blonde and tiny‚Ä¶. And I used this just now after hearing about it ‚Ä¶ and I am in shock at my eyelashes! It is so light to put on! It‚Äôs so easy and the brush strokes every single eyelash perfectly and it doesn‚Äôt get all over my eyelid while doing it. I‚Äôve never ever seen my eyelashes this long before! 10/10 recommend! You won‚Äôt regret this purchase! And the price??? Amazingggg! Never using anything else from now on!,positive
9,Beauty & Personal Care,essence | Lash Princess False Effect Mascara Gluten & Cruelty Free Pack of 3,$4.42 - $17.98,5,"I'm on my 3rd tube I of this product for a reason. My lashes are very sparse and shorter now after chemo several times and I was becoming frustrated. I'm lousy at applying false lashes so I've been looking for a mascara alternative. This fits the bill in every way. Yes, there is a learning curve - less is more with this product and you need to practice your technique. I scrape off most of the excess when removing the brush from the tube and slowly wiggle the brush back and forth from the base of my lashes upward and outward to apply to avoid the clumping that I've seen in some users photos. You can also apply a second coat to lengthen your lashes a bit more for a more dramatic evening look. The result is amazing. If you find your lashes sticking together a bit, just separate them with a dry spoolie tool using the same wiggling technique. My son's girlfriend thought I had extensions or was wearing false lashes! I've recommended this product to many people and everyone is thrilled with the result. Yes, it's black mascara but it's not an inky black so they do look more natural.",positive
10,Beauty & Personal Care,"Mighty Patch Original from Hero Cosmetics - Hydrocolloid Acne Pimple Patch for Covering Zits and Blemishes, Spot Stickers for Face and Skin, Vegan-friendly and Not Tested on Animals (36 Count)",$12.99,4,"I've been using these patches on and off for the past year and finally feel comfortable with leaving a positive review. Every month I get a few painful scattered pimples on my face and neck and back. The patch is probably most helpful in stopping my urge to pick at the pimple. But after wearing a patch after 8 hours it does seem to draw out some pus/. Sometimes I don't notice anything after the first patch but usually the next patch will draw out some pus if the first one didn't.

I have used several other Hero patches and unfortunately did not find any of the other ones to be helpful. Specifically I used the Micropoint Patch for Dark Spots (purple box) and all of my spots are still dark. The Micropoint for Blemishes (green box) doesn't seem to help any more than the regular Hero patches, and I don't like the prickly feeling though it goes away after a few seconds. The long rectangular Mighty Patch Surface (orange box) is toobig and peeling it of feels uncomfortable like peeling off a bandaid. Made the mistake of putting large patch on my neck and was nervous about my neck skin getting stretched out when I peeling it off.",positive
11,Beauty & Personal Care,"Mighty Patch Original from Hero Cosmetics - Hydrocolloid Acne Pimple Patch for Covering Zits and Blemishes, Spot Stickers for Face and Skin, Vegan-friendly and Not Tested on Animals (36 Count)",$12.99,5,"I am 33 and suddenly getting adult acne on my jaw line after getting off birth control. Cruel fate lol. It's all on my chin and it's cystic, deep blemishes. I tried these patches after being extremely disappointed with the Peach Slices Microdart ones. They were $1 per patch and a complete waste of $$$.

Then the Hero Patch came along. These are so worth the money it isn't even funny. They aren't making some of my angry cystic pimples disappear overnight, but they're SIGNIFICANTLY reducing the size, redness and duration of my monthly experience. I have popped them on burgeoning breakouts with great results. They're not advertised for the kind of acne I specifically have but they are pretty dang good at treating it!

I even put a couple patches on a cystic pimple that just never healed properly under my skin and they're healing that, too.

Thankful a f for these.",positive
12,Beauty & Personal Care,"Mighty Patch Original from Hero Cosmetics - Hydrocolloid Acne Pimple Patch for Covering Zits and Blemishes, Spot Stickers for Face and Skin, Vegan-friendly and Not Tested on Animals (36 Count)",$12.99,4,"I got these when nothing else worked for some pimples that were causing major swelling in my face. I couldn‚Äôt get in to see a dermatologist for several weeks and needed to do something before my appointment so I wasn‚Äôt so embarrassed about how I looked. The patches made a difference right away. It‚Äôs still taking some time, but I was satisfied enough with the way they performed to get them a second time. Some things you should know: 1) I‚Äôm almost 60, but still dealing with acne and it didn‚Äôt scorch my skin. 2) These patches are about the size of a dime, which is just right for many pimples, but not for larger ones or break outs. You‚Äôll end up putting a bunch on and that probably doesn‚Äôt work as well as using one larger one. I‚Äôm trying the larger size for my second purchase. 3) The adhesion isn‚Äôt bad, but if you have seeping from the pimples, the patches will slide off. When I used some toilet paper to lightly press to that area, then apply the patch, it stayed on better. However, if too much moisture accumulates under the patch, they tend to slide off. 4) They covered the pimples I was embarrassed about and treated them at the same time. They didn‚Äôt look that strange and are practically invisible. I felt comfortable wearing them in public. So they‚Äôre not a miracle, but they do help an awful lot and are definitely worth their cost, in my opinion.",positive
13,Beauty & Personal Care,"Mighty Patch Original from Hero Cosmetics - Hydrocolloid Acne Pimple Patch for Covering Zits and Blemishes, Spot Stickers for Face and Skin, Vegan-friendly and Not Tested on Animals (36 Count)",$12.99,5,"This is the number one skin care product I cannot live with out, I make sure to never run out! They are the highest quality pacthes at the best price I've found after trying many other brands. Amazon even offers same day delivery for them!

I really like that the whole box is one large size and not a mixture mostly containing tiny, useless patches. These start to work within hours, draining the yuck and shrinking the pimple all while protecting it from more bacteria and irritation. May also prevent you from popping or picking at your pimple (if that's something you struggle with.)

They leave a matte finish that is barely noticeable, but they certainly aren't the clearest patches I've tried. However, I'm sure you could cover it with makeup if you wanted, I personally don't wear foundation or concealer. Also, this brand sells and invisible patch as well to be worn during the day time.

So to sum things up here, if you're someone like me who struggles with acne or even just an occasional pimple- buy these and you won't be disappointed. I seriously wish these were around when I was younger!",positive
14,Beauty & Personal Care,"Mighty Patch Original from Hero Cosmetics - Hydrocolloid Acne Pimple Patch for Covering Zits and Blemishes, Spot Stickers for Face and Skin, Vegan-friendly and Not Tested on Animals (36 Count)",$12.99,4,"The patches would sometimes still lift on your face (on the edges) just from taking them off the plastic. They would need to sit on my face longer than 8 hours to really handle it all, or i would do two. One when I wake up and one when I get up to go to work. I would be worried about walking around with a hole in my face. They blended in pretty well when I did have to wear them to work though.

If you have the urge to touch your face or pick at things I would recommend them because they sort of stop you even if you‚Äôre more aware that something is on your face.",positive

This arrived in the middle of a stress breakout and my face is already clearing up. I really wish I‚Äôd taken before and after pics. I stuck to my normal nightly skincare routine but did it earlier than normal to give my moisturizer time to set in, and then applied the patches before bed. I‚Äôd take them off in the morning before my morning skincare routine and I‚Äôm super satisfied with the results. I‚Äôll be purchasing these again, for sure!",positive

Naturally, during the summer, this is embarassing to the point of wanting to say covered up. I am SO happy to have randomly come across these magical little patches. They are simple to put on your skin, and fairly easy to take off. I truly appreciate that the almost blend into your skin, and are not very noticeable unless someone looks very close. After a few days of using patches on a targeted area, I notice a significant decrease in oil and swelling in the area. ANY time I feel the start of a bump, I immediately put one of these on, and can assured it'll stop the growth before it even has time to think!",positive

I'm a 45-yr-old woman who STILL battles acne on my face and have folliculitis so I also break out on the rest of my body. It sucks, but these make it so much better! Where I used to get multiple breakouts on my arms and legs and end up picking at them (gross, I know, but it is what it is), now I stick one of these on at night when I can see it really getting started. In the morning, the bump will be lower and it takes the redness out so they're much less noticeable and I'm much less likely to pick at them. I will never not have these in my bathroom again!",positive

My chin will not stop breaking out with cystic acne that eventually turns into whiteheads. I love that now as soon as a white head shows up I just pop one of these on at night, and the next morning it‚Äôs looking amazing. I also have worn them during the day in front of people and it is subtle enough for me to not feel embarrassed wearing it. Thank you to the geniuses that came up with this technology!",positive

This is especially important at night, as I've been know to pick at my zits in my sleep and wake up with new scars. These stay on all night long, and my pimples feel a bit better in the morning.

20,Beauty & Personal Care,"Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant, Facial Exfoliator for Blackheads, Large Pores, Wrinkles & Fine Lines",$11.00 - $55.00,5,"My skin type:

- Very Dry, easily dehydrated
- Oily nose
- Prone to stubborn acne and closed comedones
- Redness on chin and cheeks (not rosacea)

I already use a nightly Tretinoin cream (.04% concentration) to help with my acne and premature signs of aging but decided with my derm that incorporating a BHA would be a good idea to help with my seriously stubborn closed comedones and some irritating textural issues. It was between this and the Cerave SA lotion and I ultimately decided on this due to the higher concentration of salicylic acid.

It's moisturizing, and feels sticky for the first 5-10 minutes after application but seems to sinks in to something of a satin finish on me and I can no longer feel it on my skin. You just have to be a little patient. My skin feels well hydrated and plump after it settles and looks really smooth and my pores aren't as obvious. It sits just fine under makeup for me but I'm not a new user to chemical exfoliants so I don't have lots of dead skin pilling up or sloughing off when I use it, my skin is, for the most part, already very smooth outside the acne and CCs. Occasionally I'll apply it further down my neck/decolletage than usual and WOW do I old skin just ball up and peel right away - it's so gross but also satisfying. So those that don't exfoliate often or are new to BHA/AHAs will likely have issues with foundation until their skin adjusts (but it will adjust). My advice in those cases is to either use this at night for the first few weeks or just accept going barefaced for a little while if you can.

I'd strongly suggest not applying this product over anything that you feel does not dry down fully, the times I've attempted to use it after serums or heavier products it takes forever to sink in and sometimes never fully does. I save all my serums and essences for after this has absorbed and it's far easier to work with it as a result. My steps go like this most days: ACWell Licorice toner --- PC 2% BHA --- 10% Niacinamide serum --- TO Matryxil serum --- Secret Key Black Snail cream or Syn-ake cream w/ 3 drops Stratia Fortify oil --- Sunscreen.

It works fairly quickly IMO, on my neck where I typically don't apply my Tret at night I noticed the peeling and balling of dead skin on day one and on my face where I have a patch of really awful CCs I noticed them getting smaller and smoother by around day 3-4. I'm going on about 8 days now and they're barely visible unless I'm right up in the mirror and feel as if they're almost gone when I touch my fingers to that area. I do have some slight peeling of the skin around my mouth and nose but it's not terrible (likely because I already exfoliate the heck out of my skin with the tret).

Some tips and things keep in mind:

1)
DO NOT RINSE IT OFF. I don't understand some of the top reviews advising people to do that, it says on the bottle not to rinse and nearly all chemical exfoliators are meant to be left on until the next cleansing specifically so they can do their job. If you rinse it off you're either going to prevent it from properly exfoliating or end up irritating the hell out of your skin. If you have oily skin and feel this might be heavy on you than you can probably just use this on bare skin and then sunscreen if you use in the AM or a lightweight lotion/cream and be done with it, but you need to leave it on your skin.

2)
You have got to use sunscreen while you're using this product! Any BHA or AHA exfoliant causes increased sun sensitivity and you have to address that in your routine. You should already use sunscreen daily but it becomes a must when you incorporate a chemical exfoliator or you risk sun damage.

3)
Less is more! Don't slop this on your face or soak a cotton pad in it, a little goes a long way and you'll be kicking yourself if you apply way too much and have to wait 20+ minutes for it to sink in. Use a shake or two and add more if needed but go easy.

4)
Expect some irritation initially. Chemical exfoliants can be harsh and rough even on sturdy skin and you have to give yourself time to adjust. Over-exfoliation is a possibility but sometimes just introducing a BHA or AHA into your routine can cause some sensitivity. Don't panic and just be gentle to your skin. Use ceramides (like Cerave Skin Renewing cream) or fatty oils to soothe your face if needed and try to stay away from any harsh products or acids like Vitamin C right after applying this to avoid really burning your face.",positive

This review is based on my experience as a 34-yr old woman diagnosed with PCOS. I've been struggling with acne, cystic acne, and rosacea for almost 11 years. I used to take super powerful medicine...don't do it. It screws up your hormones even more in the long run. Acne is a huge part of PCOS, and can get out of control very quickly. Keep in mind that I have also been implanting new diet changes (DF, GF, sugar free, no eggs, no grain, low carb) and supplements as directed by my Naturopath.

I was desperate to finally change my skin. I had to be in my brother's wedding in 6 weeks, and I so badly wanted to feel confident in my skin. It was risky . There was no guarantee that my skin would be done purging by the time 6 weeks rolled around, but I took the risk. Surprisingly, the first week, my skin cleared up nicely. But then...into week 2 began the purge. Mind you, my purge wasn't crazy. It was small pimples, but a lot of them; with new ones every single day. Cystic acne under jawline was constant, but manageable. I already had a pretty strict skincare routine before trying this, so I feel like my skin wasn't as bad a say someone who's skincare routine is less strict.

As you can see from the photos, I had a couple purging periods. The first was at it's worst around 30 days of daily (once a day) use of Paula's Choice Exfoliate. It seemed to follow my menstrual cycle a bit, but my good days were few and far between for the first two months. By the end of May, I was beginning to think it wasn't working for me. The week before the wedding rolls around, and I get a large cystic bump on my chin, very red, with little pain, though. This could have just been stress, not sure? Fast forward to mid-June. As I'm writing this, it has been a solid week and a half since I've experienced a fresh breakout. My old acne is healing, and my scars are beginning to fade. It's also important to note that I started using the CeraVe SA Cleanser AM and PM a couple weeks before the wedding. And since I've been using it, I feel like my skin has really started to take a turn for the better.

I wouldn't say that this product was 100% the reason for my skin looking the way it does now, but I do know that it has a large part to do with it. I don't expect my skin to be perfect forever, now. My skin still changes a lot throughout my cycle, so I expect the typical PMS breakouts, but this month has been very smooth sailing compared to the first two months, and it makes me REALLY excited!

I love when people share their skincare routines. So if any other ladies out there who are PCOS sufferers, this is what my AM and PM routines look like.

AM:
1. Cleanse with CeraVe SA Cleanser (gently massage into face for 30 seconds) & rinse
2. Apply The Ordinary's Naicinamide & Zinc Serum on damp skin (let sit for 1 minute)
3. Apply Esmi Skin Probiotic Skin Mylck as my moisturizer (very light moisturizer - let sit 1 min)
4. Apply DRMTLGY's Broad Spectrum 45spf Protect sunscreen (very important, very light, no white cast)

PM:
Double cleanse
1. Cleanse once with Esmi Skin Minerals Uncomplicated Cleanser
2. Cleanse again with CeraVe SA Cleanser (gentle massage for 30 seconds)
3. Apply thin layer of Paula's Choice Exfoliate to damp/almost dry skin (wait 15 minutes)
4. Apply Esmi Skin Minerals' Hyaluronic Serum (let sit for 1 minute)
5. Apply Esmi Skin Minerals' Probiotic Skin Mylck
6. Apply thin layer of Terminator Benzoyl Peroxide 10% to problem areas (massage in on top of moisturizer, I do this because it's too drying if I put it on underneath moisturizer)

Don't make the mistake of putting the Paula's Choice Exfoliate on after skin completely dries. This dries me out very badly, and my skin will be tight all day the next day. I used to let it sit on my skin for 30 minutes before finishing my routine, but now I'm down to 15 minutes. I feel like it's still very effective.

The Ordinary's Salicylic Acid 2% mask is also very useful to dry up an active breakout or encourage something under the skin to come to the surface. I usually only use this one time. Anymore than that on that same spot, and it'll turn red and be very dry (in my experience). Let the mask sit for 15 minutes. I only use a dab of it on the active acne spot. I don't know if I would have the courage to smear this over my entire chin/mouth area where I'm prone to breakouts. It's very drying stuff.

I know this was long, but I hope that this will help someone else who may be experiencing not just adult hormonal acne, but acne caused by serious hormonal imbalances and insulin resistance due to PCOS. I FINALLY feel like I'm on the right track!",positive

I would post pics but don‚Äôt want to offend anyone.

I would say on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being a few pimples and 10 being pimples covering a large area uncoverable by makeup my situation was about a 4.5

I had tried scrubs, alcohol, creams, IPL and dark spot correctors with minimal results.

This cleared up one spot I could feel coming in overnight and now I would say I‚Äôm about a 0.5 almost cleared. I got the package on the 12th it‚Äôs now the 24th I‚Äôve missed a few days in between but tried to use 2x at least daily

I got the sample size the photo where I‚Äôve drawn the line shows how much is left. The size is 1fl oz but this is not a cream. It is a liquid. I have been just applying and rubbing in no cotton ball

Just make sure you wash your hands after because it will start peeling your dead skin off your hands too as well as the area so if your planning on wearing shorts exfoliate before just in case.

I do not get acne on my face, I do get it on my butt or legs occasionally though. I wouldn‚Äôt say my skin is sensitive so if yours is maybe try a small area first and if your skeptical do the $10 bottle it‚Äôs liquid so it goes further than you think

Didn‚Äôt see any reviews for butt acne so if that‚Äôs an issue for you try this out before buying the products specifically for that with mixed reviews try this out",positive

I started using, all in the same few days: Paula's Choice liquid exfoliant (this), Cos de Baja Vit C serum, Skin Smart Antimicrobial Face Cleanser. I was already using my own homemade witch hazel & rose toner, a tea tree bodywash as facewash, Hanhoo watermelon overnight illuminator, and Christine Moss moisturizer. My skin was just NOT cooperating and needed to get whipped into shape.

So, this stuff I use at night with the Hanhoo overnight illuminator, and I use the Vit C serum & Christine Moss moisturizer during the morning. I use the toner and face wash at both times.

The thing I like about this is 1) it works. If there's a blemish & I'm using this, that blemish is going to straight up disappear within 2 days. It also doesn't smell like anything, unlike the vitamin C serum, which is always a little vomit-like given the acid/citrus, and not exactly evocative of the dewy-skinned delicate fae queen vibes I'm trying to throw off with this glassy complexion, you feel? Always a bit like waking up on a dirty couch after a night of beer pong with some lowlifes, wondering how coyote things have gotten in the past however many comatose hours. So it's nice to use this at night, in order to not have to reek like that when I wake up smushed against a pillow, smelling myself.

The thing I don't like is, if your hand is wet, you can barely tell this from water - it is so thin. It just runs everywhere. It doesn't really adhere at all, and so it's hard to tell (if your face is even slightly damp) if you've got enough or got it in the right place.

But overall, that's no complaint. I'm very happy with the results. Have had no weird peeling, no new breakouts, nothing awful. Will update if that changes, but going on a week here & it's working as well as I'd hoped, based on prior reviews. In other words, it seems to really get the job done, better than just chanting to sprinkling holy water on it - which is basically how I feel with about everything else.

I took before and after shots, but then realized I don't want to post my mug all over the interwebs. But to narrate what is in the pics - my face isn't really hotter but it is less distractingly unpleasant. Hahaha Which may be the best one can hope for with these genes. I still need makeup, it's not quite a Christmas miracle. I'll keep using this stuff, barring catastrophe, and will update you if it gets me to a point where I am so acne & splotch free I can go makeupless.

I have been dealing for years with adult acne that I've been to dermatologists for and have been prescribed medication and the acne kept coming back. They keep saying it's my hormones, but all my blood work came back normal.
I started this at first in my nightly routine just applying after cleansing and toning and and for the first 5 weeks my acne actually got way worse. I was ready to throw it away, but the person who recommended it to me said to give it up to six weeks as my skin would purge it's pores. At about the 7-8 week mark there was significant change, it was like it cleared up all the acne overnight. My pores looked smaller, I was noticing some fine lines were almost disappearing, and my skin was almost glowing again. I ran out of this and didn't re-order for a few months and the acne came right back. So here I am ordering another bottle although this time I'm using morning and night. If you have sensitive skin I'd recommend only using once per day until your skin gets used to it, but then you can gradually add in twice per day morning and night.
There's no harsh smell, its a liquid exfoliant so it almost feels like you're just putting a toner on and not using scrubbing particles to exfoliate your face. I love this product.",positive
29,Beauty & Personal Care,"Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant, Facial Exfoliator for Blackheads, Large Pores, Wrinkles & Fine Lines",$11.00 - $55.00,5,"Let me start by saying I have congested skin, so I know I need an exfoliant. I have used a large number of scrubs, peels, etc. throughout the years and most were bleh. I had become frustrated recently once again with my skin needing help and I saw this item. I decided to try it, and I have used it two nights in a row.

Outcome: I could see a significant difference after just the first night. This morning after the second night/application, I still saw an improvement. I am excited that my skin is looking smoother, clearer, and has smaller pores after just two days. I repeat TWO DAYS. I will keep putting it on every night since it does leave a bit of a residue on the skin that I feel I would not like during the day (but maybe it was because I put a lot of it on). Overall, I will continue to use it. And for it being as effective as it is, I don't think it's going to irritate or make my skin red like some other exfoliants have used. But if anything changes I will update my review. Right now, if I could give this 10 stars I would.

Also, I feel like this will only help people who have skin that needs exfoliating. If you have decent skin or skin that doesn't need exfoliating, it may not be that amazing nor effective. But it all depends on what your skin needs, so if you have any needs that this product addresses I think you should give it a go. It at least won't harm or irritate your skin.

*Disclaimer: I put on a significant amount of this both nights, probably about a good double dose all over my face and the front of my neck and rubbed it in a bit with the cotton pad. I am certain this sped up the exfoliating process, and as I continue to use it I will probably go down to putting on just one application rather than a double application each night. I may eventually go to every other night, but that remains to be seen. I will just go with the flow and do whatever my skin needs. So far, amazingly effective.

UPDATE: After the 3rd double application last night, I am STILL seeing an improvement in my skin. I will go down to a normal nightly application starting tonight since my skin is feeling a bit tight. It isn't inflamed but I can tell it could become irritated if I continue double strength applications daily. And my skin is much improved already, so there is no reason to risk irritation. I will update how the regular single application works. Oh, I am seeing wrinkles diminish as well under and around my eyes!

UPDATE #2: After the normal single application last night my skin is still improving. It doesn't feel as tight as yesterday, so it was a good I listened to my skin. Will continue with single layer nightly applications! Still loving it!

UPDATE #3: After several more days of using it only at night and an overall single application (with a little extra on certain areas of my face), my skin is still continuing to improve. I am definitely sold on this.

UPDATE #4: After almost another week of use it feels like my skin has gotten used to it so I will be using a light coating in the morning with moisturizer afterward, and a heavy application at night also with moisturizer after. I will let the exfoliant fully dry before putting on the moisturizer to make sure it stays where it should. I will report back on how it goes. Fine lines are diminishing and it seems like a few darker spots on my face are slowly lightening. So far, I am still loving it. (I am also putting it on the front of my neck and upper chest and it's helping there as well.) HOWEVER, I am not a person who puts on foundation or much makeup, so I am not sure how using this during the day would affect someone the foundation staying in place or not. Once I am back to my normal work outside the house I may decide to use it only at night, we will see.

UPDATE #5: I am still using this daily twice a day and still seeing improvement in my skin. A few darker patches of skin near my temples are lightening, my pores are still getting smaller, and my fine lines are still diminishing. I have set this up on a subscription because it works so well for me. I hope this review helped you!",positive
30,Beauty & Personal Care,REVLON One-Step Volumizer Hair Dryer and Hot Air Brush,$31.18 - $79.99,5,"I have a lot of hair. A LOT. Like, wow, who is that Wookiee over there LOTS. I have looked into having a third arm surgically implanted (Is this a thing? Who would do it? Vascular surgery? Orthopedic surgery?These are the questions that keep me up at nightü§î) because my shoulders are so tired holding up a dryer and a round brush for eternity. I briefly considered making a workout video (‚ÄúToned Arms: the Hairdryer Workout‚Äù), but was informed by fitness people that there isn‚Äôt a market for a 75-minute focus on the anterior deltoids. I almost have to wake up BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP in order to have enough time to dry my hair before work.

This thing took me 8 minutes. I naturally assumed, upon finishing, that I had entered some sort of Amazon-created beauty time warp. I checked with my husband, in the next room, and in fact I did not go through a blowout wormhole. The silkier-than-silk style was accomplished by this miracle of a brush in 8 minutes (several more minutes were lost to running my hands through my hair and flicking it over my shoulder while smiling coquettishly in the mirror).

If you struggle with an over abundance of hair like I do, seriously consider giving this amazing contraption a try.",positive
31,Beauty & Personal Care,REVLON One-Step Volumizer Hair Dryer and Hot Air Brush,$31.18 - $79.99,5,"After seeing the advertisement for a similar, higher-priced product, Amazon search results brought me to this Revlon dry and style all-in-one for a quarter of what the higher-priced product cost; this is a steal in comparison to the competitor.

The Delivery

The product showed up at my door in its original box and they slapped a mailing label on it. This gave me pause because since there was no protective packaging, I thought for sure the dryer would have been damaged in transit. Thankfully, the product was undamaged when I took it out of the box. On further inspection, it was not scratched or dinged up and it worked as soon as I plugged it in.

The Dryer

The product itself is quite large and larger than what I had expected. The oval shape of the brush head seemed concerning to me as I've only ever used a round brush with my NuMe Ionic Hair Dryer. The settings are cool, low, and high and are located on a dial at the bottom end of the dryer. To use the product was self-explanatory, all there is to do is plug it in, select the heat setting, and off you go to a great blow out.

The Experience

Before blowing out my hair, I use whatever hair product I have on hand at the time. Right now, I am using a coconut oil hair moisturizing serum which helps to temper flyaways, leaves the hair with a smoother finish, and moisturizes. For my hair length, a nickel-size amount is just enough for my just-past-the-shoulders hair length and then comb through. Then I section off my hair to make drying more manageable.

Starting with the back sections, I started with the low setting and brushed in a downward direction and letting the brush feature volumize on its own. The back sections are the most difficult for me because they are, for some strange reason, wavy, unruly, and difficult to keep straight. This brush dryer brought the back parts out and under for a nice bouncy finish. It was nearly a perfect 'C' formation that I couldn't believe. I then moved to the side sections and the crown and was surprised with the volume the brush gives. While I'm drying the side sections, I'm leaving hair rolled up in the brush and allowing it to remain there for a few seconds before I gently pull the brush through the length of my hair. Unbelievable. It was almost like having big Texas hair.

Finishing up with the rest of my hair, I noticed that the grip on the dryer is much more comfortable than my other hairdryer and round brush. The thickness of the pommel makes for a very comfortable grip, and I didn't realize what a difference size made. The other thing I noticed is at the upper end of the dryer, there is room to grab the end with your other hand and work the brush into a rolling motion (if you like to use two hands, which I do).

During the first use, I timed it as it normally takes me about 7 or 10 minutes to dry my hair. With the Revlon, it cut that time in half. My hair came out dry, volumized, shiny, sleek, and the finish was as though I had taken a straight iron to my hair before applying a curling iron. There was so much bounce to my hair that it felt like I just got a hair cut. When I pulled my hair into a pony at the end of the day, the pony was bouncy.

The Next Day

What I noticed when waking up the next day is that my hair was still bouncy and still sleek. With my normal hairdryer, I still had problems with frizz and my hair just did not keep through the rest of the day. Consequently, for second-day hair, I had to use a dry shampoo to give it a little life. With the Revlon, second-day hair felt just like it did the day before, which was nearly a shock. I called my girlfriend who had been looking at this product with me, and I told her that everything they said about it was true - and I didn't have to do my hair the second day because it kept through the night. Say what?!

The Predecessor

The old hairdryer and round brush went back into my mom's bottom drawer in her bathroom, for when she comes to visit. Although I have a sneaky suspicion that when she tries my Revlon, she's going to toss those in the can.

The Negative Reviews

Yes, I have read all the negative reviews about how this thing craps out after a few uses, or two months, whichever occurs first. I hope that it does not happen here, and if it does, I will update this review to let you know how long it took for it to die on me.

As for the other reviews about how the hair turns out following use . . . (1) don't leave the dryer in one place while you use, or it will burn your hair, doing anything with the application of heat has a tendency to burn if you leave it too long, that's just physics, (2) I did not have any hair loss while using this product, but I do comb out my wet hair first to work out any knots and tangles and comb through any product I am using before drying, and (3) if you do not have bounce or sleekness, um, go watch some YouTube videos and learn how to comb your hair.

Great product, unbelievable. Totally thought it was a gimmick, and pleasantly surprised at how well this works - and for the price - you can't go wrong!",positive
32,Beauty & Personal Care,REVLON One-Step Volumizer Hair Dryer and Hot Air Brush,$31.18 - $79.99,5,"I am in shock. I have tried nearly every type of hair styling devices imaginable, even that old rotating hairbrush used in conjunction with a traditional dryer. I always resorted back to a round brush and hair dryer. I've honestly gotten so good with blowouts over the years that I rarely needed to add in a flat iron finish.

The past few years I stopped straightening and went back to my naturally curly (3a) style, only busting out the blow dryer once or twice a year. From wet to straight, shoulder length, would take me about an hour to blowout given its coarseness and density.

This Revlon dryer kept popping up, and I finally decided to try it, fully expecting to return it. I thought it might cut down my hair styling time by five or ten minutes, which isn't really worth the investment, in my opinion.

I was so, so wrong.

I wasn't ready for a wash, so I decided to just wet a single strand to see how it worked. It came out nice, straight and shiny--great. But, a single strand proves little. Out of curiosity, I decided to try it on a dry strand of hair. My hair was stretched smooth at the roots from air drying in a tight wrap but pretty curly/wavy at the ends.

Normally if I attempted to use a blow dryer and round brush on my naturally air dried hair, I would expect to get considerable frizz, denting, and strange lumpy/rigid bits. I can't even use a flat iron on my air-dried hair for the same reasons. It is really stubborn unless styled from wet.

I picked a nice fat chunk of dry hair, because I didn't come to play. I applied the Revlon dryer, and in seconds, the strand went from poofy to sleek. I felt a strange sort of veneration after this. I pulled out my phone to time myself. I still expected it would take me 20-30 minutes to get my entire head done, and that I might struggle with smoothing out the more unruly bits.

This is the honest to God truth. It took less than ten minutes.

I stood petting my sleek hair, mouth agape, for another ten minutes, just to run out the timer, you know? It looked like I did a one hour blowout from dripping wet hair. Truly astonishing.

I still need to try it on wet hair, but even just having the option to let my hair air dry and then run this quickly over it makes the product so worth having.

The only cons, so far, is that I got the original which lacks the medium setting. Also, I hate that they call the color ""mint."" Mint, to me, implies more of a greenish hue, but this one is blue. Nitpicky, but I have a mint hair dryer and bathroom, so I like to try and match the colors.

It is 100% worth a try. It may not work for every hair type, but for my coarse and porous hair it worked a treat.",positive
33,Beauty & Personal Care,REVLON One-Step Volumizer Hair Dryer and Hot Air Brush,$31.18 - $79.99,4,"I absolutely loved this product when I got it. I was growing my hair out to donate to Children with Hair Loss as my covid service project. It was getting really long. The Revlon One-step volumizer blower brush worked great on my long hair. It cut the time down getting ready and my hair was smoother and had more body. I loved the look. I cut my hair to make the donation the end of March and was pleased to see that it did as good a job on my short hair. I liked it so much I bought one for my daughter-in-law for her birthday. I regularly clean the hair out of it, just like I do my normal brushes. It was easy to use and maintain. Today, out of the blue, it started smoking. It was so hot on the handle that I had to put it down in the (dry/empty) tub. It was too hot to touch and I wondered if it was going to catch on fire.

I'm really disappointed for 2 reasons: 1) I loved this styling tool and I'll miss using it, but it isn't worth risking a fire. 2) This product was only 8 months old. I trusted the Revlon name for better quality. Now I'm out my money and wonder if my daughter-in-law will have the same safety issue. I haven't yet found my paperwork to see if Revlon will make good on this.

FOLLOW UP: I contacted Revlon and explained the situation. They forwarded my concern to Helen of Troy, the division that makes this product. I was contact immediately about it and asked to provide the receipt (which I had thanks to Amazon), the model number, the code on the plug, and my contact information. Within 10 minutes of emailing it to them, I received a confirmation that they would ship me a new product at no charge. That is impressive that they stood behind their product, especially since so many purchases try to get you to buy protection plans. I don't think we should have to pay extra just in case the product we buy fails. Neither did Revlon/Helen of Troy. I'm looking forward to the new hot air brush arriving as I really did like it. Thank you Revlon! Thank you Helen of Troy. I have upgraded the review to 4 stars because of your customer service---I took one star due to the problems with the product.

34,Beauty & Personal Care,REVLON One-Step Volumizer Hair Dryer and Hot Air Brush,$31.18 - $79.99,4,"Okay so there is Legit no reviews on this product, so I am here to make one.

First I would like to say I have medium/ fine texture hair ( so more fine around the hairline , and I have medium density hair. My natural hair is very coily corkscrew. For image purposes I am mixed race , my hair would be considered more Latino then afro integrated I‚Äôll post a pic.

The short is Buy it if you don‚Äôt know how to chase with blowdryer and if you don‚Äôt know how to use a blowdryer lol, I didn‚Äôt know and I did great I was proud. It‚Äôs Lightweight and has a learning curve , decent cable length and worth the investment. DONT WORRY IT GET THE ROOTS. This was my whole point and it won‚Äôt disappoint . It is a round barrel drys great and has different settings.

So first off spec . Now this product is very light weight can‚Äôt see it tiring you out I blew out my whole head and my arm didn‚Äôt hurt that‚Äôs great. The barrel of brush is round not oval shape like the others and has like plastic flexi bristles and holes in between to allow air to pass through , the cable swivels which is easy for turning but it isn‚Äôt super long if you don‚Äôt have outlet in bathroom , so you may need an extension or need to work else where. A cool feature is the top cap comes off to help easier remove the hair at the end( the cap of the part you will hold while rotating ) The barrel honestly just looks like black metal to me not coated.

Next, using it is pretty cool and also easy to get used to a little learning curve and working in smaller sections to be more precise is good for beginners, I used it on damp hair that way you don‚Äôt burn your hair and DONT FORGET A HEAT PROTECTOR GLOVE . This you will need because high gets hot fast but I didn‚Äôt feel it on my hands with my glove. I used it mainly on low. To turn on the base has setting and you turn it to the one you want. A little hard to switch while using so you will have to stop each time .

Temp control- Cool isn‚Äôt really cool it is cooler air then low but not cold. It‚Äôs okay if maybe you want to cool down the dryer before putting it away. I used it after each section to seal style

Low is great temp and Is great to put against your scalp and it won‚Äôt burn. And does take a bit longer than high ofcourse to straighten the curls. EVEN ON LOW IT GETS THE ROOTS.

High is so hot and blows out hot air fast so work quickly you could maybe use it on your roots and then low for the rest .
Touching it after you have turned it off is not going to burn really just give it a few seconds to dissapate mad it won‚Äôt burn your counters on account of the bristles.

Now what I think , I have never use anything like this nor blown my hair before and this made it SO EASY made me believe in my self ! Now let‚Äôs be realistic , it‚Äôs a BARREL blow dryer it will not be able to straighten the ends it will curl up but the hair will not be wet and if you pass a flat iron over after you‚Äôll get the straight look. YES it straightens good enough to flat iron after.

Since your using a brush , brush your hair good first apply the heat protector and then brush it through then pick up section wrap a bit over the blow dryer and your good. Start low ,if your hair is thick use high. I like the ease of use the weight and it took me about 1:30 minutes I think but it‚Äôs my first time it was the maneuvering you have to get used to.ALSO I would remove any hairs from the barrel if I saw any so you don‚Äôt get accidental burning hair.

Overall it didn‚Äôt disappoint me in the least let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm hair styling impaired and I did great .",positive
35,Beauty & Personal Care,REVLON One-Step Volumizer Hair Dryer and Hot Air Brush,$31.18 - $79.99,5,"So, if we‚Äôre talking about hair skills I am always at the bottom of the ladder. I have lots of fine, color treated hair, and blow drying never happens. The density of my hair at the crown mixed with the porous nature of the bleached bits just makes it difficult and Doesn‚Äôt make it worth it without using a brush to make it styled. I am not skilled enough for that, and with three kids I never feel like I have the time either.

This right here dries my hair faster since it‚Äôs doing it piece wise and it keeps the easier style longer. Even with heat and ponytails my hair stays straight but not poker strait like with a straightener. I am actually drying my hair because it‚Äôs worth it now, or at least feels that way.

This has really helped me, doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs damaging my hair, and makes me feel like I‚Äôve done something for myself in a short amount of time.

It definitely takes two hands to hold, but the motor held up and it is still usable for drying although a lot of the bristles have snapped off and there is a buildup of hair products. I purchased the new version Revlon 2.0 this week. It is smaller although not dramatically. The handle is thinner. The 2.0 brush size is definitely more appropriate for my chin-length hair.

38,Beauty & Personal Care,REVLON One-Step Volumizer Hair Dryer and Hot Air Brush,$31.18 - $79.99,4,"PROS: Creates glossy, silky. smooth hair styles best for long, thick hair. Removes unwanted waves and curls. Dries and styles very quickly.
CONS: Really too big for shoulder length or shorter, and layered styles. Straightens hair, removes body.

I have layered, slightly longer than shoulder length hair that is fine textured but thick. As hair classifications go, it is ""2A"" or as I used to call it, ""wavy-straight."" I color it and it tends to be dry, especially at the ends. I usually style it by blowing it dry with a 2"" round brush, which creates waves and lots of long lasting body.

This Revlon One Step dryer-brush has gotten lots of hype and I was curious to see how it would work for my hair.
I searched it out in retail beauty stores. I've held it in my hand and was concerned that the brush head, which is 4.25"", would be too large a surface for my layered, mid length hair. It's a big and fairly heavy device and felt clunky. I was also concerned about the heat burning my hair.

When Amazon Prime Day came, I fell for the super duper price and bought the One Step.

The brush head is a flattened oval with bristles. The hair is supported well by the bristles which keeps the hair close to the openings in the brush. There is no knotting or catching of the hair which is able to run smoothly through and around the bristles as it dries.

There are three heat settings: ""Hot,"" ""Warm,"" and ""Cool."" The controls are at the end of the brush handle, and while well marked, are nearly impossible to change while using the device. I'm used to a hand held pistol-shaped dryer that allows one to switch temperatures, air strength, or from hot to cool on the go...with one hand. I have yet to be able to do this with the One Step.

You divide your hair into manageable sections and run the brush repeatedly through the hair from roots to ends until it is dry and styled. If you place the shorter end of the oval close to the scalp, you will get some lift. If you place the wider sides of the oval close to the scalp, you will straighten and flatten your hair. If it is long enough, you can wrap your hair around the brush as it dries. If you place the short end of the oval at your ends and hold the brush for a few seconds, you'll get a small wave or flip.

I found that the One Step dried my thick hair very quickly, faster than with a round bristled brush. My hair was very smooth, glossy, and close to my head. I would have preferred more ""root-lift"" especially at the crown, but I have had professional blow outs that looked similar to what I got with the One Step. All in all, the results were surprisingly good...even for such a large brush head.

Instructions warn that if you have fine or dry hair to only use the ""Warm"" and not the ""Hot"" setting. This is very good advice and it should be followed. Only use the ""Hot"" setting if you have very thick, wavy, curly coarse hair.

NOTE:

If you check out the product page, you will notice that Revlon has a comparison picture of this ""One Step 4.25"" Head"" brush and a smaller headed brush device which it recommends for shorter or layered or wavier hair styles. This smaller device is called ""The Titanium Max, 2.4"" head.""

Before I purchased this ""One Step 4.25 head,"" I went in search of the 2.4"" version. A large box store that starts with a ""C"" and ends with an ""O"" has an exclusive on this item, and of course, it was completely sold out. This smaller headed item was not on the Revlon web site. I contacted Helen of Troy (who makes these items for Revlon) Customer Service. The CS rep seemed to know nothing about the ""Titanium Max"" but told me, incorrectly that the ""One Step"" on Amazon had a 2.4"" head. She also told me that a 1.5"" headed brush dryer might be released by around the end of December. So, Revlon knows a good thing when it sees one and is expanding the line, but has yet to update it's Customer Service department with any correct or meaningful information.

NOTE: I revisited the C****O web site and was able to purchase a single ""Revlon One Step Titanium Max 2.4"" Head"" dryer brush. It should arrive in about five days. I'll review it on the bottom of this review after I play around with it a bit.

NOTE 11/5/2020: C****O cancelled my order for the Titanium Max 2.4 Head. Sigh.

After a bit of research I discovered that the Hot Tools brand is also owned by Helen of Troy and has a One-Step brush drier in the smaller 2.4"" size virtually identical to the one described (but unavailable) from Revlon.

I settled on the Hot Tools Professional Black Gold One-Step 2.4"" which I purchased from Amazon for twice the price of the Revlon One Step. I selected the Black Gold because it had a ceramic coating that is supposedly best for fine, easily damaged hair. The head is also removable and can be exchanged with a 4.2"" head, should I wish to purchase one separately. I like having that option. I'm going to try out the new Hot Tools for several weeks and will review it then.",positive

I have just below the shoulder length hair that is naturally curly. And it‚Äôs thick! Drying my hair takes about 15 minutes with a regular hair dryer and brush. This dryer cut it to about 10 minutes and the results are beautiful! I almost do not even need to use my flat iron! Seriously! I‚Äôm shocked at how well this works! It takes a little getting used to, but after 2 tries, I‚Äôm good. I am right handed so drying the right side is tricky! Love this hair dryer and highly recommend!",positive

Pretty hard to put on but easier if you dry it with a Q-tip. It went on my waterline pretty clumpy‚Äî or not smoothly. The color really pops nicely. I pressed too hard when putting it on my inner corners and broke it off but there‚Äôs a good amount of eyeliner in there to last. Pretty waterproof. I‚Äôm pretty sure I messed up most of this because i don‚Äôt have much experience, but I‚Äôm sure if you know how to use eyeliner on your waterline, you‚Äôll figure it out faster and it‚Äôll work out much better than my experience.

When applying, I found that too much pressure could cause them to break, so I gently applied them using a back and forth method, until I got the shade that I wanted. I wore them for hours and they held up well. The photo was taken about 2 to 3 hrs after applying. They are small and easy to use. I recommend!",positive

The eyeliner. Mascara and black eyeliner are daily staples for me. This liner is my back up as I prefer the liquid thin type, another brand.

Lots of humidity and heat in the area now. So, this liner may have been a 5 star item under better conditions. I like the simple, sleep design and the pigmentation is good. Self sharpening is key - my days with tearing at pencils with sharpening tools are over..

I use my eyeliner up, under my top lashes.
After chemo, 11 years ago, my lashes barely grew back. Yep, for anyone who doesn‚Äôt know, you lose ALL of your hair. Lashes, brows, nose hair, all of it. Anyway, my lashes are now super short, sparse and I haven‚Äôt any in the outer corners. I push this liner up into my lash line and under my lower lashes. I do this every day and even though I wash my face in the evening, I leave my eyeliner on. I don‚Äôt want to look at the bald spots.
This is the first eyeliner that has actually stayed. It even stays in the areas where I don‚Äôt have any eyelashes. In the morning, it will be smudged a bit, but that‚Äôs easily cleaned up with a Q-tip and a bit of water.

I can't say too much because I literally just use eye liner and eye shadow most days, occasionally blush and lipstick. I only sometime use a barrier spray which helps prolong the life of it on a day out.

I had previously bought a pump version of this lotion and my advice would be don‚Äôt. The pump isn‚Äôt effective after you‚Äôre about 3/4 through and I got annoyed by taking the top off to get lotion every day. That‚Äôs a lot of wasted lotion or wasted effort ‚Äî take your pick.

But as I contemplated moving on from this brand I remembered how nice my hands looked right after I used the lotion so I bought the pumpless version.

Bonus is it doesn‚Äôt have much of a scent so my cats are less offended when I put it on my hands and feet. My one cat literally looks like I‚Äôve slapped her when I put on anything she considers stinky but that I love the smell of. What I do for my cats.",positive
51,Beauty & Personal Care,CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,$14.99 - $52.49,5,"I highly recommend Cerave moisturizing cream for the face and body. This is an unscented, thicker moisturizer that definitely locks in moisture if you apply it on damp skin.

I found that applying any moisturizer (cream or lotion) to my body before I go to sleep makes me feel really hot and uncomfortable so I avoid doing that. Applying moisturizer to my face and neck is fine and does not cause any discomfort.

Even though this is a thick cream, I don‚Äôt feel that this is too heavy on my skin. I think this cream sinks into the skin pretty well. You can feel that it created a layer of moisture, so it‚Äôs not completely unnoticeable. If you are hesitant about whether this cream is too thick, try the Cerave lotion first. I don‚Äôt think this makes skin look glossy or shiny. This formula does not sting my eyes.

I don‚Äôt think this is the best make up primer. You can use it as a makeup primer before you apply foundation, but the foundation might not ‚Äúgrip‚Äù to your skin as well as compared to if you used a true make up primer like the Laura Mercier Foundation Primer which has silicone that makes the skin feel smoother and other ingredients that help the makeup grip to the primer. But you generally rub this cream into your skin to encourage it to sink into your skin compared to primer which you apply on top of your skin as the first layer of makeup application. I have not found a moisturizer that will adequately moisturize my skin, provide SPF 50+ protection, not sting my eyes, and help prevent my makeup from slipping off my face and creasing. I do know that the Cerave moisturizing cream is a reliable moisturizing cream. I slather it on after I wash my face at night before I go to bed.",positive

Mix that with ridiculous skin sensitivities and you get me. Lucky gal. I‚Äôve used the most expensive to the top reviewed and everything in between. This is the only thing that comes close to being perfect and I‚Äôve been recommending it left and right. It is literally scent free, as advertised, doesn‚Äôt cause oily skin, and saves you from those horrid dry and flakey spots that can be so stubborn.

I am pregnant and I used a tinted moisturizer with SPF for about a week that did not moisturize my face well enough and was causing odd redness and little bumps on my cheeks. Very odd because I generally don't have sensitive skin. I stopped using it and started using this on my face instead. After a week the problem caused by the other lotion was healed AND my face hasn't felt dry since (when before no other lotion was quenching my thirsty skin)! I wish I could afford to use it on my entire body as well, since my skind has been so dry during pregnancy. This is just fantastic lotion though! Can't say enough!",positive

If you want scars to FADE FASTER -- after you use your products, and after you exfoliate, you have to allow your skin to lock in moisture and heal.

You need to allow your skin time to repair its barrier. This lotion helps your skin do that.

Also, if you like to use essential oils on your skin, this makes an ideal carrier!! Do not apply essential oils directly to your skin - use a base oil, or some lotion like this that is non-comedogenic and hypoallergenic and scentless!",positive

Cut out anything with perfume or dye's and nothing worked to help stop it. Then I came across this and the first time I used it was like magic.

I've tried several different lotions, and this is my go-to intensive moisture option. I can put it on my feet liberally and then put on socks, and my skin will still be moisturized and soft by the end of the day or by morning, if I do it at night.

It is a great moisturizing cream. I keep it in the shower and apply as soon as I'm done showering. It's not a watery cream (I hate those). Not much of a scent, which I like. Just moisture without all the flowery scents.

This large container is useful and cost effective when used for total body ""moisturizing"" . Note that the cream provides a better barrier to moisture loss from skin than does a lotion, no matter what the brand, though marketing people use these terms indiscriminately. Bottom line: the runnier the more water the product contains. That works short term for superficial dryness but a thicker product needed for longer term protection. (Most effective in preventing water loss from skin is vaseline but this isn't useful for daytime. Good at night if skin is well moisturized before slathering on the vaseline or similar agent.)",positive

I have very oily skin so I needed something that would be oil free and as light as possible. This is a great product for that purpose, I can't speak to it's moisturizing properties or impact on sensitive skin. It is almost unscented and the scent that is there is quite neutral, so it shouldn't interfere with any other scents you have going on.

I feel like with most moisturizers and especially one with SPF, it will often feel like there is ""something"" there. However, with this product it is a very light ""something"" and it isn't greasy or shiny. It might even have a matte-ifying effect, jury is still out.

Overall it works great as a light sunscreen for shorter periods in the sun. See other reviews for other aspects of the product.",positive

90,Beauty & Personal Care,Maybelline New York Sky High Washable Mascara Makeup,$9.78 - $25.13,4,"I have fine lashes and sensitive eyes so I am always looking for a mascara that does something for me at an affordable price. This one was very good! I could visibly see a huge difference without having to use a primer (which often leaves my lashes more clumpy or heavy looking which I don‚Äôt like) my lashes separated nicely as well.

If I was to complain about anything it would be staying power. I did find that midway through the day the ‚Äúwow‚Äù lift I saw at the beginning was not as wow as before - but overall, this mascara is better than a lot of other drugstore ones I have tried. If going out for a few hours it is definitely my go too!

It doesn't flake at all! The biggest problem I have had with todays mascaras is flaking. It makes your lashes look natural and long. And best of all it builds so you can wear a light, long natural look or apply a few coats and have volume with full lashes. It's like 2 in one mascara . It washes off easy but will not come off in water. It does not run, clump or give you raccoon eyes . And best of all you do Not need a primer ! So you save money . The value on this mascara is amazing . I used to spend $26 on primer and $28 on mascara at Macys that is $54 total. So I am now saving $44 a month as I wear mascara everyday. I am so happy I Finally found the perfect mascara for me.",positive

Definitely waterproof and also pretty solid in lengthening/volume wise. However, taking this mascara off was wayyyy too difficult. I tried micellar water and makeup wipes, nothing. This did cause a good amount of damage to my lashes, as some fell off because of the pressure I was putting on them. But that‚Äôs my fault. I used coconut oil and washed it off with warm water, and that did most of the job. I recommend buying a specific waterproof makeup remover if you get this waterproof mascara.",positive

The black pencil works great on my waterline and stays all day.

It takes under a minute to do my eye makeup routine now with these great pencils. I‚Äôm going to be stocking up!",positive

I have purchased one other Julep Eyeshadow 101 Cr√®me to Powder Waterproof Eyeshadow Stick; these comments pertain to ""Clay"". The item arrived yesterday, brand new, and in original packaging. This morning I applied the eyeshadow to both eyelids after just splashing my face with some water, drying my face, and applying sunscreen. I applied it directly from the stick and used the built-in smudger at the other end to blur the edges. Here came the test! I went for a 2.5-mile jog, got pretty sweaty, returned home, changed clothes, and then played an hour and forty-five minutes of tennis. I'm a little tired, but the Julep eyeshadow is still going strong. I can't say it's waterproof since I didn't swim, but it is undoubtedly sweat-proof. ""Clay"" is a true matte but does not appear chalky. It is a pinkish light brown. I see this becoming part of my daily routine on its own and also as a base. I also have ""Ginger"" which is listed as a matte but has a slight sheen. For reference, I am female, 55, with a freckled/fair complexion and combination skin. Other eyeshadows always crease on me unless I use a base. So far, ""Clay"" and ""Ginger"" Julep Eyeshadows have provided 12-hour staying-power. I want them all!",positive

This color goes well with hazel eyes. It's more muted than the website shows in my opinion so you may want to layer it over a darker color like brown.

I really like the fact that these eyeshadows have blenders included and that they are so quick to apply. Saves me time in the morning. I do wish they printed the color's name on the side of the container though; I've made labels for each of mine for easy reading.",positive

I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the smudge tool‚Ä¶..I tried applying the Bronze on the lower part of my eyelid, then the Cocoa on the outer corner and crease, and tried to smudge the Cocoa but it seemed like it removed it more than smudging it. I played around with it and found that the best for me is to use the Bronze on my entire eyelid, then go back and apply it even more in the outer corners. If I use the Cocoa I just put a little bit in the outer corners but don‚Äôt smudge it! If needed, I‚Äôll use a blending brush to blend it. I have light skin, brown/reddish hair, and blue eyes.

I had my original Philips Neralco trimmer for about ten years or longer. I tried to find the same unit but couldn't find one anywhere. So i was left with no choice but todo some homework and start searching for a new one. My old unit was a little more contoured then this new groomer but it's surprisingly only 3 ounces less in weight, go figure? Old trimmer weighed 3.3 ounces, New groomer weighed in at 3.7 ounces with the wide trimmer on.
The New groomer although chunkier in appearance is comfortable just different. Having used the other thiner unit for ten years, it should feel different right?. The battery life will be going on two months this 10th of August on just one charge. I use it about once a week to trim my beard and mustache. I have to admit, this new unit has a small trimmer adapter and a nose trimmer attachment aswell, they will come in handy. It also includes several attachments to trim your hair in addition to your beard if need be. I personally don't use it for this reason but it's a good thing to know that you have them available in case your traveling and need them on the go.
Overall all my new Neralco groomer looks a little more classy, professional and can be used for multiple task to get you looking as dapper as you can be for a great night out, or in lol. I do recommend this groomer I'm very pleased with my unit and I would definitely make this purchase again if need be. You also receive a small black bag to put everything away so its neatly ready to travel. I wasn't given this item in exchange for my review nor did I recieve a discount of any type. I made this purchase with my own money, hope this review helps. I did alot of research before pulling the trigger on this trimmer/ groomer.",positive

It is packaged in a bubble wrap display case and already had a charge in the battery but I still charged 8hrs as suggested.

There are more than enough vids to help understand how to use the hair guards. It comes with a two year warranty and by registering the device I received a six month extension to the warranty. I see why this model is the most popular model on Amazon! There is a lot of bang for the buck in purchasing this unit. I hope this is helpful!!,positive

Two swipes with the dog clippers were enough to go searching for a better solution.
The Norelco trimmer is a good solution for any beard. The included cutters and combs should be enough for anyone unless you have a very unusual situation.

The Good
* Battery life seems quite long. I haven't recharged it yet. More than enough to cover most normal vacations without taking the charger. I trim about once a week though, so I've used it probably 4 or 5 times
* Easy to use.
* Included combs and cutters cover nearly every situation.
* Price is an excellent value.
* Bare cutters against the face or neck do not cut the skin, although they can cause some short-lived redness.

The Bad
* The charger is a hard-wired wall wart with a barrel style plug. Why on earth doesn't this use USB charging? Since I don't anticipate needing to actually travel with the charger it's not so bad, but if you lose the charger, you're probably looking at just buying another whole product. Also, a $0.10 led to indicate charging / charge complete would be worth it.
* Although the cutters and combs are easily removed and rinsed, you'll get significant debris on the main unit. Static electricity will ensure it stays put. The base unit can NOT be rinsed, so clean up on the base is a hassle. It would be much better if this could be rinsed.
* The bare cutter on the neck leaves behind a little stubble so if you're looking for a sharp line with a close shave under it, you'll need a razor.

For the price, the negative aspects are tolerable.

Push up on the *bottom* of a comb to remove it from the cutter.

In my opinion at least. I've used them for well over a decade and it's a brand I've very much came to trust and rely on. I shave my head with a razor, just about every day or two. I trim my beard and everything else, once or twice a week, sometimes three. So, I do have experience in using these products.
I've wanted to try this Phillips Norelco Multigroom 3000 for a while now. I just never really thought I needed it. Now that I've tried it, it will be in my weekly grooming arsenal for a long time to come. When it first arrived, it was smaller than I thought it would be. Come to find out, it's actually the absolute perfect size. This trimmer has a lot of tiny blades and they are sharp. Pair that with it's well above average motor and you get a great pair of trimmers. It comes with a great set of attachments and guards. There's 1mm, 3mm, 5mm and 7mm beard and stubble comb's and 3 different lengths of hair guard's. It also has an ear and nose hair trimmer attachment and a small precision edger attachment for sideburns and mustache, or anything you need to edge out. Everything is so easy to swap in and out, that you can just about do it with one hand. Don't do that though. To change the attachments, all you have to do is put your thumb on the front part of the blades or metal parts of the attachment, and just push up with your thumb. It pops right off. Be careful though, it comes off so easy that it might catch you by surprise, so don't drop your attachments. Just kind of put your free hand behind the attachment and kind of palm it. That way you won't drop it. I'm not saying that it'll pop off by accident or anything, because it won't. It's just really easy to swap them out. Also, don't forget to clean out the hair chamber every now and then. There's an included brush to help clean it.
This trimmer is by far the best in it's class. If you're looking for a new trimmer, whether it be for your beard, stubble, ears or nose hair, you will not regret buying the Phillips Norelco Multigroom 3000. It's worth every penny. Regular little ear and nose hair trimmers cost $15- $20. Look at what all you get with this and it's going to last a long time, because it's Phillips Norelco. I definetly recommend you buy this trimmer if you're looking for one. You won't regret it.
I also want to say that I wouldn't steer you to buy this product if it wasn't worth it. I wouldn't give it a 5 Star review, if it wasn't really a 5 Star item. Check out my video and my pictures of the product. It might help you make a more informed decision. I hope this review helps you out. If it did, please rate by clicking the thumbs up symbol.

Nose trimmer also works better than expected. I used a cheap knockoff brand before this and didn‚Äôt realize what I was missing until it died and I replaced it with this Norelco. It cuts the hairs deep in your nose/ear instead of pushing them out of the way.

The only thing I would suggest Norelco improve on this model is that it needs an LED to indicate charge status. You don‚Äôt know it needs charging until it dies, and you don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs done charging until ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs done?

Smooth edges, smoother medium and short beard cleanup and trims, and stubble grooming as well as zero biting without the guard to trim lines/neck.

It works well. my only complaint is that attaching pieces does not always go smoothly. I have had a single purpose nose and ear hair trimmer for a long time which worked poorly, leaving long stubble and often pulled hairs. The attachment to this does the job way better and more comfortably. I often have to wiggle thing around a bit to get a new head on. Once on it's great and they are easy to remove. Great set of attachments, can't think of anything else that might be needed.

160,Beauty & Personal Care,Maybelline,$4.29 - $23.41,5,"I am a makeup snob. I have stupidly high standards for cosmetic performance, and drugstore brands have let me down every single time I've given them a shot. So when I graduated from Covergirl to Sephora after college, I never looked back. My kit is full of Dior and YSL foundation, Armani concealer, Benefit brighteners, etc.

I say this in order to grab the attention of my fellow makeup snobs: If you would never even consider Maybelline, this review is for you.

Bloggers have raved about this product for a while, but I never bothered to check it out until a close friend and fellow product snob suggested it. Here are my findings:

1. It applies like the Armani Maestro Eraser liquid undereye concealer. This is very very essential, for those of us who hate the 5th hour cakiness of cream concealers but also hate the weak coverage and creasing of most liquid attempts. This eraser goes on with the Maestro's same thin liquid texture, without sinking into lines at all, and without losing opacity as you blend.

2. It is at least 50% more opaque than the Maestro. I was pretty stunned. Anything that can go on with that consistency but have noticeably better coverage is doubletake worthy imo.

3. The sponge applicator is better than you think. Firstly, it's antimicrobial, so you don't have to worry about the hygiene aspect. Secondly, its ability to blend the product is outstanding. I typically skip clumsy applicators like that, but with this, I do 80% of my application with that sponge tip, and then just finish with a good concealer brush to set it and blend out the edges.

4. It doubles as a highlighter. Every time I use this, I find myself seduced into just continuing the line of application from under my eyes out onto my cheekbones, brow bones, and nose bridge. A nice blending brush/sponge later, and there's this flawless highlight landscape to finish up, without settling badly into pores or caking up.

5. It sets beautifully with MUFE Micro HD powder and Shiseido translucent powder. It buffs out nicely, without chipping off into the brush.

6. It looks good without primer, which combined with its compact design and integrated applicator makes it an ideal purse dweller.

7. It worked on my thin but minimally wrinkled undereye area, and on my 60yo mother's more aged eye area. It's rare that I find a product that looks great on both our skin types, and I was impressed at how well it brightened her problem skin without caking or exacerbating the age marks.

8. It is lighter than you think, but cheap enough to test out different shades.

9. It lasts so much longer than you'd expect. I tested it on bare skin during a work-from-home day, just to see how the wear was, and was delighted to find it still working fairly well by the time I went to wash it off that night. I wore it again with a full face for a date night, and it looked flawless when I went to wash it off later.

There are times when you don't want the totally opaque, nearly airbrushed look... but there are definitely times when you do. This eraser is now my official go-to product to pair with my Dior Airflash foundation, for those totally flawless skin look occasions. I could not recommend it higher, at very least as an experiment for the snobs among you.",positive
161,Beauty & Personal Care,Maybelline,$4.29 - $23.41,5,"I have tried many concealers over the years. My issue is deep tear tracks, and age more the discolored skin. No product is truly going to fix that, but this sure helps! I got the color right first time. I do moisturizer and let that sit a bit before applying. It helps to have a soft concealer brush or makeup sponge to blend as more product comes out then I need (working on getting that right). Stays in place, does not settle weird as some products seem to end up separating and floating on top of skin. If I‚Äôm in a hurry, I‚Äôll do inner eyes, nose and around mouth and blend out well and it‚Äôs all I‚Äôll need. Tapping a bit of MAC Studio Fix really keeps things in place for me. I am a MAC NW 25, I purchased the medium. I like this better then MAC, Nars, and Este Lauder concealers to name a few. Real winner especially at this price!",positive
162,Beauty & Personal Care,Maybelline,$4.29 - $23.41,5,"OK ... I have over my 50+ years of life tried every blend of concealer made, ...... and this ""concealer"" is by far the best! I applied my usual foundation makeup, first. Then what the makeup didn't cover up ... I used the ""Age Rewind Eraser"" on top. Just ""click"" up the amount of ""eraser"" into the foam dobber, and begin ""dabbing"" on your facial area of discolor; old-age spot, pimple, zit, mole, you name it ..... and the product perfectly hides your problem area. The designers behind this product really thought out this applicators function, bc it works like magic. The product is light weight, creamy, and magically blends into your skin-tone. Throw all your other cover up products out, bc this one is great! Plus ++ on the days you don't even want to wear makeup .... this covers the blemishes all by itself!

163,Beauty & Personal Care,Maybelline,$4.29 - $23.41,4,"Let‚Äôs start from the beginning‚Ä¶the package is conveniently shaped. It‚Äôs easy to hold, which aids in application. The cap pulls off easily so it doesn‚Äôt crack with applied pressure. The dial at the bottom only needs a few turns and the product comes out onto the soft applicator sponge, which is sturdy and allows for many ways to apply. I dab on the product in small areas for spot coverage. I sometimes want more coverage and glide the sponge across a larger area. The actual product blends evenly and provides great coverage. I will certainly order this product again. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars is because the color wasn‚Äôt what I expected. Thankfully, I ordered 2 in different colors so I was able to blend them.",positive
164,Beauty & Personal Care,Maybelline,$4.29 - $23.41,4,"I bought this to use as a concealer/highlighter for my horrible undereye circles. It works fairly well. I've had some skin issues that I'm using medication for now so I will continue to test it out. It works with my pale skin and goes on smoothly. My only complaint is that I can't stop it from coming out. I want to put a little on then use the sponge to spread/dab it across my eye. But more product keeps coming out and I'm not putting any pressure on it. So I put a little on, then use my finger to spread it to the rest of my eye.",positive
165,Beauty & Personal Care,Maybelline,$4.29 - $23.41,4,It's one of the better concealers I've tried over the past few years. It is not as good as the one I used over 35 years ago from Loreal which was in a tube and even after it dried up the dust could be dampened and applied and was amazing. Others also covet that but it's not made for over 20 years I believe now. Anyway this is ok. I bought two different shades and I do have dark circles since I was 8 years old. My Mom called them racoon eyes. But this isn't all that friendly to larger poors sadly and so I wasn't fully happy with it not just because it's not my actual favorite for ever product no longer made...but I don't like attention brought to the poors and it kinda does if you aren't super careful and a super light touch during application.,positive

169,Beauty & Personal Care,Maybelline,$4.29 - $23.41,5,"I have dark hair, blue eyes, and fair skin with cool undertones. I spent a lot of time figuring out which color to buy. I finally decided on 160 Brightener, and it was perfect!! I use it underneath my eyes and dab it on any red spots on my face as I only use a tinted moisturizer most days. Blends in evenly. I only use a few drugstore makeup items, and this is one of them.",positive
170,Beauty & Personal Care,24K Gold Eye Mask,$14.99 - $30.99,4,"I have no idea what they put in these things but they're the ONLY product I've ever seen work to reduce my under eye bags and discoloration. My bags are severe so this doesn‚Äôt completely remove them but the results are quite noticeable! Also important to note, they don‚Äôt leave product on your face. This isn‚Äôt some weird potion that creates a layer of crud or crust. It just soaks in and helps shrink the puff and erase red or purple discoloration. I don‚Äôt personally wear makeup but for those who do I bet these can drastically reduce the amount of makeup needed to hide circles

My understanding is that eye bags can be caused by fat pads that protrude or from swelling/water retention and congestion. I‚Äôm not sure if these patches would help if the issue is fat pad related but for those who suffer temporary swelling and puffiness, I suspect these patches would be great

I have health issues that lead to edema, causing swelling and discoloration around the eyes. If fact, my swelling was so bad I had to get upper eyelid surgery last year because my bags were blocking my range of vision. Now, my under eye bags are just too severe to ever disappear using a product but these patches do help shrink them. Even better, it drastically reduces the purple discoloration caused by what is said to be congested capillaries slowing circulation.

If these things help *my* awful bags I think they would really do wonders for people with less severe issues.

The results are temporary so it‚Äôs something to use when you want/need to look refreshed. I think they‚Äôd be a great tool to add to anyone‚Äôs toolbox",positive

If my skin is throwing a tantrum & I needs a little TLC, I can‚Äôt skip this moisturizer so after PM application, (depending on how my skin looks & feels) I‚Äôll apply a thicker gel or cream moisturizer and/or CeraVe healing ointment. Works better than $100 overnight masks I‚Äôve tried! After a year & a half, one day I realized I only had a couple applications so I RAN (haha) to Amazon & purchased another.

If your skin doesn‚Äôt like Niacinamide, you might not like this formula or it may sting when you first start using if you have broken skin. I really think it‚Äôs worth a shot! If it doesn‚Äôt work for your face, try your neck, hands, arms, legs, feet, etc. or gift it to a friend who will ever love you!

Stay gorgeous! üòò",positive

I began using it when I discovered how great their AM Moisturizer with SPF30 was. I then began to purchase nearly all of their facial product line. What I love about their PM Moisturizer is I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs safe to use with any of their facial cleansers. I use their Foaming Facial Cleanser which is a basic cleanser for normal to oily skin. I have oily skin & it‚Äôs truly the best facial cleanser I‚Äôve found. Pairing these 2 products up is wonderful with toning in between. I learned the great benefit of their Renewing SA Cleanser which exfoliates my skin & has salicylic acid in it. Again pairing up this moisturizer with this cleanser is safe. I‚Äôve had no adverse reactions. Finally, my teenage Son began to suffer from acne. I purchased their Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser which has benzoyl peroxide in it. Not all moisturizers are safe to use with this ingredient. This PM Moisturizer is! This moisturizer is very lightweight & absorbs nicely. My Son uses it AM & PM & it works well for him. He also uses a retinol based product to help with his acne & once again this moisturizer works wonderfully! This is our go to moisturizer! I don‚Äôt use it every night as my evening skin regime varies but for my Son this is a daily use moisturizer & I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd use if I hadn‚Äôt found this. The bottle lasts quite a while. For such quality the price is amazing. I utilize subscribe & save so I pay a little less & order at my convenience. There is no scent to this. One final thing I‚Äôd like to note is this moisturizer has 3 essential ceramides, niacinamide & hyaluronic acid- all wonderful ingredients for our skin. This is a WIN, WIN moisturizer made by CeraVe & I highly recommend it!",positive

The packaging comes in a nice pink bag with lashes as well as make up brushes and wig cap in brown/tan color as a gift. I would definitely say still well worth the price I paid for what I received!
