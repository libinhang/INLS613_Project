0,Audible Books & Originals,I'm Glad My Mom Died,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"THIS IS BY FAR, THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ ALL YEAR BY DEFAULT and I give Jennette McCurdy many props for writing this blockbuster of an read while being extremely honest about it and no sugarcoating, unapologetic, unfiltered, uncensored, no holds barred and a damn great fascinating read. ALREADY ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS OF ALL TIME!

Right from page one, I was taken on a journey about her life growing up, the difficulties with her own mother with the emotional, physical AND psychological (going as FAR on her mother being in the shower with her until she was 17 while ""examing"" her in the process, made me gag) with being forced to be anorexic even as an 11-year old and parts of her adulthood made me cry really hard chapter by chapter and I couldn't even put down this book even for a second. None of the abuse that she has suffered isn't okay at all, child star or not, BAR NONE.

The stuff with her writing about the Creator made me really angry and sad especially the costume tests with the bikinis as she being underage at the time while her mother encouraging it truly horrified me to the core as I totally wished that I want to punch the Creator and even more after reading as justice for Jennette.

Also, the BTS stories on the real experiences of working on ""Sam & Cat"" that she wrote about even nearly getting her chance to finally show her directing skills only to be taken away from her at the eleventh-hour filming on set of S&C as they shattered her dreams while Nickelodeon tried to bribe her with a $300,000 hush money settlement for not going public about her experiences working with the network as she did the right thing on turning down after them protecting a predator for so very long.

The biological father twist was a huge twist to and how her cancer-stricken mom died while lying to her for her entire life even from beyond the grave disgusted me even more that she was forced to be the perfect daughter for a mom who I might as well say, ""The ULTIMATE NARCISSIST Mother from Hell that could Joan Crawford a run for her money"" and the journey of actually meeting her real father.

It was like sitting down and having coffee with Jennette as I was moved by her story and her finally getting her long-needed vindication with the difficulties of being a former child star and getting to share her story to the world and telling a true statement and reason why she doesn't want to return to the show that made her a household name and I don't blame her even after reading this blockbuster of an read with the amount of anxiety that has been stuck with her for years while living in an image that she didn't fit in with and never getting to experience her childhood courtesy of her own mother.

I admire Jennette's strength and determination for having to write this book even if it isn't for everyone and the amount of hours and years of healing. I say this from one writer to another, YOU HAVE A NATURAL TALENT FOR WRITING AND I'M SO READY FOR MORE OF YOUR FUTURE WORK WITH THIS NEXT STEP.

I GIVE THIS BOOK, 11 OUT OF 10 STARS AND TO BE HONEST, 1 BILLION STARS OUT OF 5 as a huge fan of her work and so many mad props and many positive praises that I won't be able to list about my life for this book cause Jennette McCurdy is one hell of an storyteller and I totally wish that I could meet her and give her a nice huge hug with my list of congratulations on how I really, really loved this book to which I'm sure she might be reading this review. :)

After reading this, I too am strongly glad that her mother died too and I have been hyped for this book for months and it is finally here as I totally hope others can read her story despite the overwhelming demand for this book and I hope you can see things in a different light after you read this masterpiece of a book along with some of the finest cover art I have seen in quite a long time with the most UNORTHODOX but really the greatest book title I have ever seen in years of all my life growing up reading books and all of 2022.

Already planning to re-read it again and again and planning to get the audiobook to fully experience this with her narration. GET THIS BOOK ASAP AND I'm glad her mom died also.

I totally hope the success of this book will make Hollywood really wake up about former child stars being mistreated for different reasons and having their stories being told like Jennette's while putting Dan Schneider once and for all behind bars while we're at it for all the crimes he also committed toward her.",positive
1,Audible Books & Originals,I'm Glad My Mom Died,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"I had my child at 38. By the time she was finished with cartoons and started liking ""peoplie"" shows I was in my 40's . ICarly, Sam & Cat were 2 of her favorites. I have to admit I loved both of those shows as well. Jeanette was our absolute favorite on both shows. So, funny. Great comedic timing and great physical comedy skills as well. We never understood why she just disappeared. Respect to her co-stars but I always felt Jeanette had the talent to keep moving. Reading this book really helped me understand. She was abused by her mom on so many levels. The showering and ""exams"" till she was 17 was the most glaring and disturbing example of her lack of boundaries. So many parents especially mothers create eating disorders in their children. They know they're doing it, they know how terrible it is. It was done to them and instead of breaking that cycle they just keep pushing the they way they were pushed. Her mother gave her a terrible relationship with food that she may never fully reconcile. I was extremely overweight as a child I was so lucky I had the world's greatest mom. She always gently tried to push me to make good decisions and to eat healthier I was already a super active kid but I was 250 lbs in 7th grade and I walked into every room like I owned it. Never occurred to me to feel bad about the way I looked. I had a mother who loved me and instilled such a confidence in me and I'm lucky I still carry with me today. I have never fully reconciled my relationship with food. Addictions on any level of very hard. I've also struggled with alcohol and drugs in my life even cigarettes. But the sad reality is you can lock somebody in a room for 6 months without any of those things and they won't die. If you lock somebody in a room without food you're going to die. So you need to come to some sort of understanding with food to develop as healthy a relationship as you can because it's something quite literally no one can't live without. I always enjoy watching the aforementioned shows, but after reading this book I love her even more. She's a wonderful woman she's done a great job. I fell in love with her when I was 40's, she inspired me then and in my 50s she's still inspires me after reading this book I wish her nothing but success in love, life and in the future. Most of all I wish for Jeanette to fully love herself. I wish total healing and I hope someday she can love herself as much as the world does! Congratulations Jeannette you deserve all the accolades from this book because it's honestly, and painfully yet beautifully written. Peace & Love",positive
2,Audible Books & Originals,I'm Glad My Mom Died,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I read A LOT and have literally never written a review but...

...Omg, omg, omg this book is so real, shocking, sad, relatable, unpredictable and somehow really funny at the same time.

She is a really talented writer with a wild ass story.

I also grew up with a mother who has NPD - and royally screwed up the relationship with my bio dad and robbed my youth from me - and saw all the classic signs. My mom is still with me and I secretly feel so much relief to think of when she's not here torturing me anymore.

Your family is a roll of the dice - you don't get to choose them. And not everyone gets a good one.

This book is permission and grace to not feel required to have toxic people in your life simply because they are blood related (which you had no choice in - you didn't ask to be born).

And to face the hard stuff for YOUR benefit (no one else's) and come out of the other side so much better for it.

I do wish there was more of this book only because it was so good:

- more on the real dad (where is he? do they talk? How did her mother even have TIME for an affair since it seems like she was constantly up Jeanette's ass?)
- also, who she is now. It focuses a lot on the past vs. present and she has come SO far.

I will read or watch anything she writes and can't wait for the next thing (hope there is one!) Like write a series, movie, play - you've got SKILLS Jeanette!",positive
3,Audible Books & Originals,I'm Glad My Mom Died,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I finished the audiobook within 24 hours. It's read by the author, so you get to experience this story through her voice, which I highly recommend.

I'm not famous, never acted, and I've never suffered an eating disorder, but still relate to McCurdy in so many ways. The first half of her book perfectly captures the experience of being a people-pleasing child surrounded by broken adults. You know something is wrong, but you're unable to name it or explain why it's wrong, and as a child you can't escape it. Navigating your life becomes a terrible game, it's not fun, but being ""good"" at that game also gives you a sick sense of pride.

The latter half speaks to mental illness, familial myths, and abuse. The aftermath of such an upbringing.

I liken the overall feeling of this book to a childhood injury I had. I was like, 7, and I got hit in the face by a bungee cord. (Right above my eye.) I felt pain when it struck me, but I was oddly fine. I didn't even cry. It wasn't until I climbed on the toilet to see myself in the bathroom mirror that things changed. I saw how bad the wound was, and knew the moisture on my face was blood, not sweat like I had thought. After knowing, the wound felt different. And I cried, got stitches, and ended up with a permanent scar.

McCurdy was a child, living the life she knew, recognizing in her own way that things were bad, bargaining and rationalizing those feelings away to survive, to win, until she found herself lost, broken, and unhealthy as an adult. Once you know things, you can't go back.

It's a dark story, but a relatable one, and it's recounted with enough dark humor to give you a breath before you sink too deep. I loved it, I'm rooting for McCurdy, and I look forward to reading (or listening) to more of her work in the future.",positive
4,Audible Books & Originals,I'm Glad My Mom Died,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,Sheesh! This was written perfectly. Jeanette explores the foundation of her relationship with her mother while also trying to find herself and where she might have taken a wrong turn. This books just goes to show that money can't fix the things inside of you that are already broken until you do a little work yourself. There's some tearful moments and some light hearted moments. Growing up as an iCarly fan it read like a behind the scenes bit at times. I remember some of the episodes mentioned. While she was busy making us laugh on screen off screen she was not doing well. I'm happy she's better now and I understand why she named the title what the title is. Her journey to stability and health took some time for her to understand that her mother was not the hero she thought she was. That's a hard pill to swallow.,positive
5,Audible Books & Originals,I'm Glad My Mom Died,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"My mother recently passed, not from cancer but other, unnatural circumstances. She was constantly walking out on our family and struggled with mental illness. This past birthday of mine was the first birthday I was aware of her passing. (Even though we found out from the federal bureau of investigation she actually passed in 2018). I've been struggling with her loss. I know that her being alive would have only been detrimental to my mental health as well...but it's difficult relaying these feelings with those who have had ""normal"" mother daughter relationships. I want you to know that I'm truely sorry for how you've struggled but also that I am so grateful to see this unconventional relationship on the page. I bought your book on my birthday. I read it in 2 days. Couldn't put it down. It helps to read someone else's story sometimes, so thank you for your bravery and putting it out there.",positive
6,Audible Books & Originals,I'm Glad My Mom Died,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I listened to the audiobook version of this, which is narrated by Jennette. Personally, I love memoirs especially from celebrities, and this is no different. I was a huge iCarly fan growing up, and while I never got into or really watched Sam & Cat, I've been a fan of Jennette. This was so beautifully written and the awareness that Jennette has about certain things (and later on after some guidance) is remarkable. You truly never know what happens behind closed doors, and social media/media in general is fake, and this is proof of that. It's truly sad to hear about everything she went through to get to where she is now, but I am so happy for her that she made it. Cheers to her, and fingers crossed this book makes her more money than she ever could've and did earn in her acting career.",positive
7,Audible Books & Originals,I'm Glad My Mom Died,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"As someone who romanticizes the idea of being famous while knowing full well there is a toll it takes, Jennette’s story always sat heavy with me. I knew piece of her story before the book and felt for her. The details and the tone of her writing really kept me going through even the darkness it presented. There’s so much raw truth and it is so unapologetic.
I enjoyed seeing her start to make strides in her personal life and show the ups and downs that came with it. I truly hope she continues to thrive and live her life fully and for herself, whatever that might mean for her.
Fantastic read, 11/10, recommending to all my friends, especially my age group that was as obsessed with her career as I was. So everyone can see the whole picture.
Jennette, I truly wish you well <3",positive
8,Audible Books & Originals,I'm Glad My Mom Died,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Jeanette has been through a lot in her life. I did not have a famous life, but I can relate to some much she went through- the the poverty, the hoarding, the abuse of a narcissistic, mentally-ill mother and more importantly the shared relief it was when my mother died. I have absolutely no guilt surrounding this either. I too cut off family who want to continue to use me as a scapegoat, a lost mother figure, a cook, a cleaner, a protector. I understand her relationship with food, because of my own experiences as a child, I have a stockier build, so if I complained of being hungry, I’d be mocked “is your fat quivering?” So I just learned to make my own food, tried to never complain about hunger pangs. Life gets better! Jeannette is very brave for telling her story. I’m happy for her present triumphs and all the future holds for her.",positive
9,Audible Books & Originals,I'm Glad My Mom Died,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,To be honest I was not expecting much from this book. I had never heard of her before (I'm 58 yrs old) I thought it would be another typical bad childhood/happy ending book. But I quickly changed my mind. She has been through literal hell both physically but especially mentally. Her mom who I think she is still too easy on; where's the well-deserved anger?! was a monster with no redeeming qualities that I can discern of. She practically destroyed her. Reading the book made me hate her for what she put her daughter and sons through. Not to mention her unfortunately weak father who failed in his duty to protect them from her abuse. She has accomplished so much in searching and working hard to attain some semblance of mental wellness. And it seems she has achieved that.. She fought and tackled an enormous mountain that many are unable to accomplish. She is Brave. She is intelligent and funny besides that. I hope she knows that no one can achieve total happiness. But it sounds like she is doing a damn good job of living her life. She has my very best wishes to have alot of peace and happiness in her life. I thank her for sharing herself with us. And I hope she makes alot of money on her book!,positive
10,Audible Books & Originals,Where the Crawdads Sing,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"What I liked most about this book is the depictions of believably real (though fictional) characters challenged by real-life issues, with the characters' basic motivations well described and integrated into a story of how the characters succeed or fail against their challenges, and why. I believe the philosophical term for literature of this kind is ""metaphysical values.""

(I haven't seen the movie so far but probably will see it eventually. Meanwhile, the various trailers that I've seen seem to indicate that the novel's main spirit may have been badly mangled in the movie, possibly to emphasize issues such as racial prejudice and other forms of bias against those who are ""different,"" and other contemporary concerns. From various critical reviews on this website, it also appears that the story itself may have greatly misrepresented what North Carolina was actually like in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. But I don't see geographical or historical accuracy as necessarily essential to a fictional story concretizing important metaphysical values.)

At the end of the novel, in the Q&A with the author (pp. 376-377), there is a very concise description of what the book is about. The story follows the life of a young girl named ""Kya"" living mostly alone in fictional marshlands in North Carolina from age 6 to her death from natural causes (unexpected heart failure) at age 64. It's a story of how she survives with minimal help from anyone else. A child of 6 wouldn't have been able to survive alone for long without significant knowledge and experience gained from interaction with other humans, and she did receive minimal interaction with her mother, brother, father, brother's friend Tate (later Kya's first lover and eventual husband after a fateful 2nd love with Chase Andrews), and a married (black) couple in the nearby fictional town of Barkley Cove. Tate and Chase both disappoint Kya deeply, Chase so strongly that Kya becomes the prime suspect when Chase is found dead, apparently murdered. (Chase lied to her about potentially marrying her, and he even tried to rape her, causing her to fear that Chase would keep trying again and again by force.) Before Tate leaves her while he goes to college, she learns to read with Tate's help. He also gives her many old books to read, mostly on life science. She apparently never receives access to any books in literature, history, philosophy, or other general humanities subjects. She remains forever shy and defensive toward most other people despite becoming highly adept at studying the wild animals and plants in the marsh, writing books of her own on her observations, becoming successful as a published author, and painting vivid sketches of what she observed. Along the way, she also learns to count beyond 29 and to count money and make change, again with help from Tate and others.

At her trial for the murder of Chase, the prosecution presents serious evidence against her, but the evidence isn't quite strong enough to obtain a guilty verdict from the jury (beyond reasonable doubt). She has an especially good alibi, although it has weaknesses that leave room to doubt her innocence. Since there are also reasonable doubts about her guilt, the jury verdict is ""not guilty."" One key piece of evidence, a ""shell necklace,"" remains missing until the very last page of the story, shortly after Kya's death, when Tate (whom she had married by then) finds it. For those who want to be surprised, I won't say more about the details of the ending. Kya certainly would have had to be incredibly resourceful and daring, perhaps far larger than real life, to have been able to construct such a convincing alibi, if she actually was the murderer. The symbolic parallel to the mating rituals of fireflies provides a strong hint about Kya's mental state.

The events of the story are mainly just the backdrop. The story's main focus is on how Kya felt and how she learned so much about nature and life sciences from her own direct observations and from books that she read, without ever attending school at any level for more than one deeply unpleasant day at age 6. Despite how little she learned about humanities subjects and how to deal with other people, the story depicts her as focused on the reality that she was exposed to, and on how she used her natural intellectual capacity to make sense of it as best she could. She certainly functioned on a reality-is-real premise, though without explicitly identifying that premise or comprehending its higher implications for human living; she also felt her emotions without any explicit appeal to any greater mysticism or other-worldly perspective. (Kya shows no superstitiousness or religious worship of natural phenomena.) But the story doesn't attempt to delve further than that into issues of values, why man needs them, and how best to choose and pursue one's values. With access to books, Kya surely would have had the opportunity to do such deeper reading in real life, even if she remained otherwise isolated from most other people throughout her life. She had Tate, along with the two adult townspeople, her publisher, and to some extent her brother Jodie -- all of whom provided emotional support to her during her trial. She is a heroine of sorts, though a severely stunted and crippled one, especially emotionally toward others.

The author describes the story as ""primarily about self-reliance, survival and how isolation affects human behavior. Since our species is a social mammal, we have strong genetic tendencies to belong to a group of tightly bonded family and friends."" (P. 376.) What ""genetic tendencies"" does this refer to? How much personal choice do humans have? Man has a non-automatic rational faculty on which he needs to depend for his survival. But he also needs a lot of help from others, especially family, along the way as he proceeds from the stage of a newborn infant to adult life. Without such help in childhood, the stunted growth that may hinder a child's development and readiness for adult living should not be surprising. A more heroic kind of story might explore more fully how much more a person can learn about life from books, and how events might unfold as such a person strives to apply such learnings in practice. Kya certainly makes a valiant and largely successful effort, which, for me, makes Crawdads excellent as far as it goes.",positive
11,Audible Books & Originals,Where the Crawdads Sing,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I just finished reading (and crying through) the first novel by naturalist Delia Owens entitled, “Where the Crawdads Sing”. She has achieved a literary feat uncommon to naturalists, let alone novelists. 67 weeks at the top? Her readers are not wrong. But first, let’s talk about crawdads…

Do they sing? No. They are tiny freshwater lobsters that live underwater. They only sing, as do Maine, and rock lobsters, when you put them in a pot of boiling water and the steam expands through their exoskeleton. So no, they do not sing, nor do they do anything else that can remotely be depicted as human. However, the phrase, “Where the crawdads, sing”, is fully defined by Owens thus cannot be confused in her novel The reference to their presumed music as defined by Owens is one of her many uses of a colloquialism. She spells it out using the complete phrase, “ Way out yonder where the crawdads sing”. More context for the less colloquial is that the full phrase means in the middle of nowhere. Which is exactly where the story takes place. In the middle of nowhere. It takes place in a marsh (not a swamp, there's a difference) along some stretch of coast on the eastern seaboard of the United States. The exact location doesn’t exist. It’s fictional. Owens includes a map, which I referenced frequently. Mind you, this is no Narnia, this is no Middle Earth, but this is as real a place, even more real, than any presumed backdrop for any other great novel. West Egg for instance. Just like West Egg on the north shore of Long Island, this marsh on the eastern shore of North Carolina cannot be found on any map, nevertheless, it’s a place I would like to visit.

The phrase, thus, refers to being beyond the most remote area of the wild as possible. Off the map, off the grid. Way out yonder where the crawdads sing. A place, very different from, and as remote as, any place in Africa where Owens spent much of her professional life as a naturalist. Beyond anything we know, the marsh she created is truly in the middle of nowhere. It is here where the main character, Kya, finds herself alone. She has been left alone by family and most of humanity. We are witness to the abandonment. As a little girl she is forced to live on her own and survive in the wild. Shades of Jody Foster from the movie Nell…except she speaks English and she has a lot more food to eat. That is, if you like seafood. Mussels and smoked fish, and whatever sprouts from a shabby wild vegetable garden. She was not raised by wolves, or gorillas, but instead by the marsh itself. And a lot of seagulls and other sea birds. The marsh is her mother. Most of us couldn’t fathom the life of Kya--essentially on her own since age seven. Think about that for a moment…if you don’t cry…you should. I cried three times in the first 125 pages of the story. I cried 4 or 5 more times before the end of the story.

This book, I presume since Owens is well read having spent a lot of time on her own, crosses many genres. Her naturalist side shines through as the wild is on display on every page. Yet her story is a murder mystery since the body of Chase Andrews is found dead in the marsh in the prologue. She uses poetry frequently. Her own poetry, which is quite good. And of course, it is a love story of deep dimension. Difficult--to say the least--because finding love in the middle of nowhere is not easy. Unless you find it within yourself. One can’t say it’s a coming of age story, since the novel spans all of Kya’s lifetime…but yes…a Marsh Girl can come of age…and have it all. And of course there is the courtroom scene related to the murder. Pick an author, Grisham, perhaps. We shall see when Hollywood releases their version in a few months how Owens dialogue holds up to Perry Mason. Will the courtroom dialogue be credible? Despite Kya’s profound literacy, which you will discover on her journey, Kya doesn’t pull a Lisbeth Salander (Stieg Larsson) and turn the tables on the court. She’s more humble, crippled outside her marsh, withdrawn from the process, meditating, and mostly concerned with the cat who lives in the court house. If you are rooting for her, as I was, prepare for another bout of tears.

The book is a page turner because this story jumps from the pages and comes alive in your mind. Kya is real. She is alive. She will now exist in literature just as Captain Ahab and his whale. Kya and her Marsh. Owens brought her to life through her thoughts, her paintings, her poetry, and her music. Perhaps the best apologetic for an absent family, Owens walks through the conditions that must have been present for those responsible for her abandonment to receive forgiveness. As well as those who cared, but not enough, to keep her isolated. The reckoning, in the courtroom, was perhaps insufficient. Justice could never be served for the rising fear and prejudice visited upon this young girl by a town full of ignorant people. Yet some did rise above, in their own way, and Kya understood. It’s her understanding of human nature, through the eyes of our own evolution that shows us that we are not too far removed from the animal kingdom. There but for the grace of God…not into the fires of hell but rather into the bountiful Garden of Eden--the Marsh. The sins of the animal kingdom cannot be judged as sins--as when an injured mother fox leaves her kits in order to survive to another day where perhaps she may rear another litter when survival is more certain. Can the momma fox be judged?

This is perhaps Owen’s legacy. Crawdads don’t sing--a fiction at best and anthropomorphism at worst. She knows it. Animals do not take on human characteristics. Only the truly ignorant would believe things move in that direction. Fake naturalists such as Elizabeth Marshall Thomas (The Hidden Life of Dogs) springs to mind as the purveyor of such garbage. Rather we can now look to Owens as the author of something as profound and insightful as from the true greats like Henry David Thoreau who wrote, ""In wildness is the preservation of the world”. Here is where Owens lives. Here is where Owens sings. Her voice a whisper above the din but a true voice calling out in the wilderness to be heard above the wind through the palmetto trees or the waves crashing on the sand leading into the marsh. To the gulls who circle above the beach and are friends with Kya as she sleeps. To the other wildlife that saunter by her without pause. She is one of them, not the other way around. Justice, therefore, is a natural one and subscribes to nature’s law. Balance in this natural world can always be restored. This is the true beauty of Owens' novel and no doubt the key to her success. Five-Stars for Owen’s first novel and this literary feat. A must read for everyone who claims they read books. Kya will stay with me, and you, forever...",positive
12,Audible Books & Originals,Where the Crawdads Sing,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"True story. I tried to listen to the audio of this book 3 years ago. After the first couple of chapters, I didn't like it at that time and I left it for other novels.

Recently, I decided that I needed to give it another try since I want to watch the movie and I prefer to read the book first before I see it on the screen.

I don't know if I can add anything in regard to the plot. I'm sure so many people know what this book is about but if you have been living on a deserted island without working wifi for the last few years, then my review is for you.

Kya Clark is a small child when she is abandoned by her mother, then her siblings, and lastly, her father who leaves one day to never come back. His father was abusive and this is why her mother and siblings left the Marsh.

Kya gets nicknamed the Marsh Girl and she learns to survive on her own thanks to nature and her own desire to make it.

In 1969, Kya is a young woman when the body of Chase Andrews is found and the townspeople point a finger at Kya as the main suspect. After all, rumor has it that Chase visited her all the time.

Where the Crawdads Sing brought out so many emotions from sadness to anger to disappointment to happiness.

Delia Owens makes the Marsh a character on its own. She did a wonderful job at bringing it to life. The way Kya learns from it was amazing!

The isolation that Kya suffers because of where she was from was heartbreaking to read. A young kid left behind by everyone and no one really cared to help her except for Tate and Jumpin'. She was misunderstood and cast away, worse than an animal. Then there was the mystery of who killed Chase and why. If I'm being honest, I figured it out early on. However, I still like the way the story developed.

Time to watch the movie.

13,Audible Books & Originals,Where the Crawdads Sing,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"The storyline in this novel is good, but not strong, and the lush, detailed descriptions of the North Carolina wetlands and marshes are exquisite. Kya is a sympathetic character from the beginning, but I felt like she never really grew much as a person. Her outlook on life remained childlike even into old age. The ending was not surprising other than the identity of the poetry writer, and while the last chapter wrapped those interspersed poems together, I found them distracting throughout the novel - I wasn't sure why some of them were there. I think I could have found the ending a little more plausible if Kya had shown any deep-seated anger for everyone who disappeared from her life (and everyone did), and she forgave some of them, but not others, and ultimately acted on one with a wave of anger I didn't get from her throughout the story. Loneliness and loss, yes. Some anger at those whose attrition she never understood, yes. But angry enough to do the unspeakable? I didn't get this vibe from her character's psychological profile.

As a lawyer, I thought the courtroom scenes were very well done, but when Kya's lawyer didn't put her on the stand to testify, I knew what the outcome would be. That probably wouldn't resonate with the average reader, so it worked well, though that part of the plotline was pushing the limits a bit. No matter how well-read Kya became as she educated herself with Tate's help (and unless she was a prodigy, she wouldn't have learned as much as she did in five years), I don't think she would have had enough experience with the real world or the knowledge to set up and successfully navigate her actions with the precision she did where Chase was concerned. The author also didn't do enough research into the State of North Carolina concerning distances (it's a good eight hours or more from the fictional town she lives near to Asheville), family histories (her father's family didn't come from a plantation near Asheville - there weren't any of those - mostly small farms), and dialects of characters from different parts of the state (the ones with accents were either evil or not, but Kya spoke perfect dialect free English). All that aside, this book isn't a bad first novel, though the author's developmental editor should have fixed some of the problems it has. I don't think it's bestseller material.",positive
14,Audible Books & Originals,Where the Crawdads Sing,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"Well, I read the entire book in one day, so I can't say it didn't hold me until the end, but so much of it was disappointing, given the hype and the gushing over it. The descriptions of the marsh and of Kya's awakening as she learned to read and found entire worlds to explore near her home were brilliant. But the love stories read like a cheesy romance novel, a jarring contrast from the much more nuanced nature writing, and something I couldn't get past.
The dialogue, for the most part, felt like it belonged in a different book, considering how great the descriptive passages are. Very little of it rang true, and some of the dialect was off-putting and offensive--as in the conversations with Jumpin' and Mabel. (Shades of Steppin Fetchit.)
Chase said 'ya' instead of 'you', as if to differentiate him from every other character--or to make him appear dumb or a lowlife. I don't know what it was all about, but it got to me after awhile.
As others have said, the poetry was irritating instead of inspiring. None of it seemed to apply until the last one at the end, which may be intentional. Again, I don't know. Tate did say he thought the poetry was weak.
The courtroom scenes were quite good. They, in fact, were what kept me reading to the end.
The back and forth between the years got really irritating and a little amateurish.
There was a brief passage written in second person before she went back to third person, and I wondered how an editor missed that.
That, and the rather silly romantic dialogue, became distractions. A shame, because Kya has such a beautiful story to tell.
And lastly, I'm glad I read the book before I read the reviews here, since so many readers decided to give the entire plot away. Why would anyone do that with a book that's essentially a murder mystery--emphasis on 'mystery'?",positive
15,Audible Books & Originals,Where the Crawdads Sing,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Kya lives in the marshlands of North Carolina with her poverty stricken family. Her father is abusive and, one by one, her siblings leave and, eventually, so does her mother. Her father stays and he seems better for a time, even kind. Then he falls back into his old ways again and ends up leaving too. Kya tries school for a day but after being bullied, she doesn’t return. She makes it completely on her own and digs mussels to sell to the local store to bring in money for food. Tate, a boy a few years older than Kya, loves to explore the marsh. They become friends and he teaches her to read. With reading, she discovers and teaches herself to be literate and all about the marshlands and its nature. She illustrates and collects samples of everything she finds in her marsh area. Tate leaves to attend college and becomes a biologist and works in the marsh. He submits Kya’s illustrations and notes to a publisher and she becomes a published author several times over. She adds comforts to her house and lives well by her own wealth. She lives simply but she gets electricity and running water and other basic comforts that she's never had. When Tate went away to college, he realized that his life would be difficult for Kya. So, he doesn’t visit her for years. While he’s away, the local and popular Chase moves in on Kya. He tricks her into thinking he’s going to marry her, all the while dating other women. Kya eventually sees his engagement article in the local newspaper and ends it with him. Later, he attacks her, trying to rape her and he beats her up. She fights back and escapes. His body is found later and it looks like he fell from the fire tower in the marsh. Since he was a local celebrity, the police are pushed to investigate for foul play. Kya is arrested and faced with a murder trial. The whole time I’m reading the part after Chase attacks Kya, I’m hoping she killed him but I also don’t want her to be found guilty. The suspense builds to intensity and I couldn’t put the book down! Tremendously honest, heartbreaking and soul healing! 5 stars!",positive
16,Audible Books & Originals,Where the Crawdads Sing,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I love this book. I purchased it so I'd have something to read on vacation, and it was the perfect book to take.

From the first page, I got lost in the marshes of North Carolina, and the world in which the heroine Kya lives. Time jumps forward and back, but jumps perfectly to keep the stories past and current (1969) simultaneously moving to the climax. The stories kept me so enraptured that I literally stayed up half the night to finish it. I couldn't put the book down for anything. And I'm glad.

Crawdads felt very much like To Kill a Mockingbird. Simple time, southern home town, prejudice, murder, and a trial with a defense attorney similar to the beloved Atticus Finch. The descriptions of the people, town, marsh, and wildlife, make you feel as if you are there experiencing everything with the characters. And the story will keep you guessing until the end.

When I turned the last page, part of me was extremely disappointed only because I didn't want the story to end. It's a rare book that can pull me in so completely, and this one did just that. I just wanted to keep reading, and reading, and reading.

Order this book, and carve out a quiet space and time so you can immerse yourself. Get comfy with a box of Kleenex and prepare for a journey to the marshes of the South, back in the sixties before technology we enjoy today, when you could slow down long enough to feed the seagulls on the beach, and search for shells and feathers in the warm breeze of the North Carolina coast.",positive
17,Audible Books & Originals,Where the Crawdads Sing,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,3,"I'm an avid reader and tend to read more literary fiction by contemporary writers, or mystery fiction by British, Irish, and Scandinavian writers (a lot of American mystery series are very one dimensional).

Typically I find a lot of best sellers are pretty one dimension too, but they make for great Netflix or HBO series, or films (Big Little Lies, Sharp Objects, etc.). Anyway - I really didn't want to read this book because so many people liked it, but sometimes a great book ends up being a massive hit - Gone Girl was really good, The Midnight Library, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (I still love Scandinavian Crime Fiction thanks to this International hit).
But for some reason, the last few years, I kept putting this book in my cart, then taking it out, then reading reviews and putting it back in, then reading other reviews and taking it out. Needless to say, I was going to not ever read it, but my husband who doesn't typically read fiction but who loves the coast of our state - NC - wanted to read it. So we decided to read it together which was such a new and awesome experience. This is what is good and bad about the book in my opinion:

Good:
The description of the landscape. The author is a nonfiction / naturalist and zoologist / ecology writer, so she had amazing description of the animals, marshes, and coast. You could really get lost in these descriptions and this is probably the best thing about the book.

Kya - the protagonist - is a survivor and a character you root for because she's been treated so badly - by her family and everyone else. She's an interesting character in that her loneliness leads her to her passion for the marshes and coast, and as an introvert myself who would rather be alone than around people at times - I envied her isolated shack near the beach and her ability to just hang out exploring the coast all day.

Kya's friendship with Jumpin' and Mabel - they are both warm hearted characters who help Kya when she is young and are almost like adoptive parents to her, although they don't impede too much on her life. I liked their bond and thought it was plausible.

The metaphors the author uses between the animal / natural world and Kya's life / experiences. These were interesting, and definitely ""in your face"" as you were reading, but I learned things about the natural world I didn't know before and a few of the comparisons made me think which I always appreciate.

The bad:
The dialogue is not believable at all. Characters speak like they are living in the same Louisiana Parish as the characters from ""Steel Magnolias,"" and even though these are Southern folks who might be more isolated on the coast - and it's the 60s - no one speaks like this in NC (the accent). Also - characters always speak in full sentences to one another and explain their thoughts and feelings as if they are all very emotionally mature and well rounded people rather than broken and dysfunctional. Kya doesn't really speak like this most of the time, but everyone else does. People just don't speak like this to one another - in full sentences, and able to explain their thoughts and feelings so clearly - right in the moment. If this were the case, we would all be in a much more peaceful world. Communication is hard in the real world - especially when you are hurting and broken. The way the characters explain everything they are thinking so well and in full sentences makes the book kind of cheesy at times and almost like a YA read. This aspect of the book just didn't go with the landscape descriptions.

The love triangle:
It's pretty typical that in most popular books featuring a romance, you'll have the love triangle with the awkward yet beautiful chic in the middle - loved by two men. I understand it's value to drive suspense, but Tate and Chase both end up being kind of douches.

Things just don't make sense in a lot of ways:
No snakes in this book? Asheville as a destination from the Coast? No one in town trying harder to help this girl who everyone knows lives on her own? Some things just don't add up, including the mystery itself and why the Sheriff wants to pin it on Kya so much when his life would be easier if he just called it an accident as it looked to be anyway. I think she was capable enough of raising herself based on her ability to feed herself and the friends she made along the way, but she never really got hurt - other than the nail which doesn't seem plausible.

Overall - I'm looking forward to seeing the film because I absolutely love the landscape in this story and want to see Kya's shack and the way she interacts with nature which is the best thing about this story. The book was uneven to say the least, and it's certainly not going to be on the AP English literature reading list one day. But it has a protagonist that most people would love to root for, and the setting is great.

For a book featuring atmospheric natural landscape descriptions and interesting characters with unique experiences, as well as literary prose, I recommend Swamplandia by Karen Russell. It's set in the Everglades and captured my imagination in a way this story wasn't able to.",fair
18,Audible Books & Originals,Where the Crawdads Sing,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"The book that everyone is talking about - and I had to see for myself. Plus I wanted to see the movie, and whenever there’s a movie based on a book, I prefer reading the book first.

I loved the premise, a murder mystery, a historical coming of age story about a girl abandoned by her family and forced to rely only on herself living in the marsh, a celebration of nature, and the unique growing pains she goes through.

I enjoyed being on Kya’s journey with her and watching her grow from an abandoned, confused little girl to being a self-sufficient adult. It hurt to read about her getting hurt, but the few friends she makes along the way are true.

Not the biggest fan of the writing style, and the head hopping got a little confusing (though I don’t read much literary fiction so I don’t know if this is normal?) at times and I wasn’t a fan of the court scenes - felt jarring and out of place. It’s told in two timelines that eventually merge - one of Kya’s life, the other of the ongoing murder investigation of one of her ex-boyfriends, but markings of the year under each chapter prevents confusion.

Overall I’m glad she got her happy ending - though the end end throws in a twist I didn’t see coming. I’m looking forward to the movie!",positive

This book has had me feeling so much in the last day and a half. At one point I felt so sad for Kya and then the next minute I would be so happy for her and then the next chapter I would be absolutely mad on her behalf or cursing her in my mind for wanting to see the good in someone who didn't deserve it. I am honestly sad for this story to be over but I am happy to say that every question that I had throughout this story was answered by the end of it and I really do feel like it all came together amazingly and allowed readers to not only glimpse Kya's life but experience every bit of it with her. I love this book. I will likely read a few other books and then come back to this again as I sometimes do with other stories that I've truly enjoyed. The details provided really help you paint a picture in your mind and allow you to feel like you're there with Kya, experiencing her marsh and nature through her eyes. 10/10 do recommend!",positive

Her journalism career is already under fire as her last few stories have been too centric on what she thinks vs. the facts. While Margot is convinced, she is going in the right direction her publisher disagrees and the fight for her professional life is on.

When Margot finds her Uncle Luke in much worse shape than she imagined she starts to wonder if she can manage all this in her life. Coming home was enough of an upheaval as she never resolved her issues of her friend being killed when they were six. She has tried to move on but that is not what happened, nor does Margot think it can until she finds the killer. Everyone has their resolved conclusions about who did it but and refuse to see the connects to other murdered children including the one that just happened last night. All the similarities are there but with everyone dug into their decision of who is guilty getting them to move is impossible.

Margot is trying to deal with her uncle, an unknown person leaving cryptic notes, and the woman stalking her and too illusive to confront. The deeper Margot digs the more suspects and suspicions she comes up with and everyone she looks at has all the makings of being the one that took specifically January away but also the other girls that no one is looking at. But Margot has finally found the link from her friend January’s murder to the latest one and with razor sharp intuition she forms a plan on how to get the evidence to close the case.

Margot deals with her uncle, the multitude of potential people that could be involved, as well as forming a friendship and ally where she could never have expected who helps her bring every to fruition, or so she thought.

Ashley Flowers has written a compelling and intriguing book that is as mesmerizing and entrancing as it takes you down so many paths of potential conclusion. While you may not like the ending it is the authors choice to deal with the story and characters as she so desires.",positive
21,Audible Books & Originals,All Good People Here: A Novel,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"A string of child murders in a small Indiana town become an obsession for a reporter and former resident. Margot returns to Wakarusa to care for her ailing uncle, Luke. She moves in to help with daily tasks, due to Luke’s cognitive decline. Quickly immersed again in the gossip and thrum of small town living, Margot picks up the thread of a cold case, involving the death of her childhood friend, January Jacobs, 25 years ago. The rumor mill speculates that the case is related to other recent homicides of young girls. The book loosely resembles the JonBenet Ramsey case, and perhaps the story was structured around, or inspired by, that real-life crime. The book reads like a screenplay. Heavy emphasis on plot, but no deep-dive into character development. Emotions are stated, rather than felt. Lots of telling, but very little showing. The exception to this is Jace, January’s brother. Here, Flowers gets it right. Jace’s childhood trauma is hauntingly depicted in a few vivid flashbacks and believable, nuanced dialogue. One particular two-line exchange between Jace and his mother, Krissy, is utterly wrenching. It reads like a bullet to the heart, perfectly rendering all the confusion, anger and longing of a bereft child. The scenes with Jace are sparse, but luminous and real. Other characters in the story would have benefited from this same attention to detail. The reader knows that Margot is earnest and tenacious, but in her quest to solve the mysteries of past and present, she’s met with little resistance and few obstacles. Every lead she follows pans out. Law enforcement takes her seriously, even when she says she’s being stalked by a woman, whose only defining characteristic is auburn hair. Still, the story is compelling and there is enough momentum for the reader to want to uncover the secrets and find out the truth. However, the ending arrives so abruptly and ambiguously that I thought I’d inadvertently skipped a page. I went back and re-read several paragraphs, certain that I’d missed something. I’m not sure why Flowers chose to end it on a discordant note. Shock value? Potential sequel? Perhaps to generate buzz and get people to talk about the book. Maybe because many crimes are left unsolved, and this was meant to underscore that fact. Whatever the reason, it’s a quick, worthwhile read.",positive

I was a little worried in reading some of the other reviews about the “bad” ending that I might be disappointed in the book. However, I know Ashley is an amazing story teller from her many podcast, So I stuck with my guns and purchased it. I read the book in less than a day, it is sprinkled with little bits of true crime stories throughout. Which I loved because I was having flashes of “oh I remember that story” moments and it had me thinking back to some of my favorite crime junkie episodes. I’m a master usually of figuring out the “who did it” but this one I really never seen coming! It has you guessing all the way to the very end. I honestly didn’t love the ending, but it wasn’t horrible like the other reviews had said. I felt a sadness throughout the book with the plot in general, I’m a mother of two girls (7&3) and currently 33 weeks pregnant with twin boys, so the whole story of course pulled on my heartstrings. The ending to me was both shocking and heartbreaking. I almost cried if I’m being honest reading those final pages. But I felt it was fitting to the story and was authentic to the crazy, shocking and emotional nature of real life murder cases and the people that commit these acts. I wish there was a little more closure to the ending of a certain someone but I think she left it open for all of us to devise our own theory’s about what happens to _____. I don’t believe she will write a sequel like some speculate, but I do think this was a huge slam dunk for her break out career as a author and shows that she can truly do anything.

23,Audible Books & Originals,All Good People Here: A Novel,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"In “All Good People Here,” first-time author and true-crime podcaster Ashley Flowers has given readers a “whodunnit?” of a mystery full of twists and turns that may well keep them guessing. Indeed, as I reached the halfway point, I was pretty sure I had it all figured out. Nope, I wasn’t even close.

Newspaper crime reporter Margot Davies has come home to the small town of Wakarusa, Indiana to take care of the uncle who was like a father to her and now suffers from early-onset dementia. In the next town over, only eight miles away, a young girl is found murdered, reminding Margot in a deeply personal way of the murder of her best friend and next-door neighbor, January, when they were only six. Could the two murders, and others, be connected? Is this Margot’s chance, not only to break a career-making story but to solve January’s murder and bring her killer to justice?

For the most part, “All Good People Here” is a well-written tale. The prose is professional. The dialogue is believable. Author Flowers moves the story set in the mid-1990s and late-2010s at a good pace. The characters are well-drawn. We understand what they want, why, and how their desires conflict. The small-town setting is well-depicted, especially the petty jealousies, gossip, and back-biting that can ruin reputations and turn the admired into the shunned in an instant. This is also a novel very much about family and family conflict.

I did find some logic and/or continuity problems along the way. And I thought the novel fell down at the end. The method by which part of the mystery is solved seemed somewhat unrealistic, considering ready alternatives. And readers are left hanging as to the fate of two important characters.

But all in all, I enjoyed this and am giving it 3.5 stars rounded up to 4.",positive

I believe this is a great first novel for Ashley Flowers. There were exciting twists and turns, good character development, and the setting, family dynamics, etc. were super relatable.
I felt that this novel did have some parallels with the Jean Benèt Ramsey case. There were a couple of things I wish that developed more, such as Margot’s relationship with her parents, and what Luke’s disease was. There was also a point where her uncle was described as “mean”, but that part of his character was only noted when he had episodes from his illness. It didn’t seem that his past nature was “mean” from the main character’s perspective. This book would be appropriate for teens and young adults, though there is some explicit language. This read was simple, and quick for me, I finished the book in two days. The story was captivating, however you are left with a cliff hanger which made me wonder if it will be part of a series, because there are things revealed that could set the scene for a second book. I was glad Ashley go into erotic detail with the romantic relationships as some books in this genre tend to do. Overall, my only critiques were that some of the characters could have been developed more, and some of the loose ends tied.

30,Audible Books & Originals,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I previously wrote this review right after reading the book. Today, February 15th, after applying James’s system for 100 days on a few tiny habits, I feel compelled to share updates with you because they have sincerely worked.

I will divide the review into 5 parts. The first part is a summary of the book with short excerpts highlighted while taking notes. Next, I hope to share pieces of advice that have motivated me while building new habits. Following that, I will share how I implemented the first 3 habits throughout these months. Then, some thoughts to whom I would recommend reading the book. Last, there are 4 complementary readings.

SUMMARY

[Introduction] James starts by sharing personal strategies he implemented to recover from a serious accident in high school. That event forced him to improve the quality of his routine to get his life in order, coming to the conclusion that “we all deal with setbacks, but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you will end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.”

[Section I : The Fundamentals]

[Chapter 1] Here we learn the power of compounding effect: changes that seem small and unimportant at any given day will compound into remarkable results if we are willing to stick with them for months and years. James explains that “breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.” Comparing to habits, he shows that bamboo can barely be seen during the first couple of years while the roots grow underground before exploding for almost 100 feet into the air in a few weeks. From that perspective, we come to understand the best outcomes are generally delayed.

[Chapter 2] Based on a 3-layer concentric circle behavior change model—divided into outcome change, process change, and identity change—James explains that we should pay attention to our inner identity by focusing on beliefs, assumptions, and values. “Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.” The strongest changes, then, happen from inside out, starting from our identity, passing through the process, and ultimately changing the outcome.

[Chapter 3] In this chapter we are introduced to a 4-step framework, which is composed of cue, craving, response, and reward. James calls it 'The 4 Laws of Behavior Change'. He then explains that we can think of each law as a lever that influences our behavior—when the levers are in the right positions, they create good habits effortless whereas when they are in the wrong position, it is nearly impossible. Through examples, he explains that “the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.” Together they create a habit loop that, when repeated many times, habits become automatic.

[Section II : Make It Obvious]

[Chapter 4] A primer on how cues play a crucial role in predicting habit formation without consciously thinking about the outcomes. Once our habits become so common, the cues associated with them become essentially invisible because they are deeply encoded. If we want to create better habits, a good idea is to be aware of the cues. James finishes up by sharing a strategy called 'Habits Scorecard'—a simple exercise to become more aware of our behavior on a daily basis. We first write down a chronological list of our daily habits and, once we have a full list, we score each habit as an effective, ineffective, or neutral habit. Besides noticing what is actually going on, we can notice if certain behaviors help us become the type of person we wish to be.

[Chapter 5] The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms, and the 2 most common cues are time and location. When we make a specific plan for when and where we will perform a new habit, we are more likely to follow through. Stacking our habits by pairing a new habit with a current habit is a form to connect our behavior to our own advantage. An example when building a daily journaling habit would be: “after I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will journal for 5 minutes.”

[Chapter 6] This chapter shows how our environment plays a crucial role in defining habit behaviors. “Given that we are more dependent on vision than any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior.” To build good habits, then, we should either make desirable cues obvious in our environment or build new habits in a new environment to avoid fighting against old ones.

[Chapter 7] One of the most practical ways to break a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. As James points out, “it is easier to avoid temptation than resist it.”

[Section III : Make It Attractive]

[Chapter 8] James explains how the modern food industry has created products that are more attractive and addictive to consumers, and by doing so he shows that the more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. Every behavior that is highly habit-forming tends to be associated with higher levels of dopamine. It is the anticipation of a reward that motivates us to take action. “Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.”

[Chapter 9] “We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.” That said, it is common to pick up habits and behaviors from our parents, peers, and colleagues. There is also a tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the tribe. And, finally, we try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves. One of the best strategies to build better habits is to join a culture where the desired behavior is the normal behavior.

[Chapter 10] To avoid unnecessary and detrimental cravings, we should highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit by making it seem unattractive. “Habits are unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings.”

[Section IV : Make It Easy]

[Chapter 11] “All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.” The key component is to pay close attention to the frequency we perform a habit, not much for how long we have been practicing it.

[Chapter 12] Since every action requires a certain amount of energy, we are motivated to do what is easy. By contrast, the more energy required, the less likely it is to occur. “You don't actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. The greater the obstacle, the more friction there is between you and your desired end state.” That is why we should reduce the friction associated with our habits by creating a prosperous environment to make future actions easier.

[Chapter 13] There are decisive moments that deliver an outsized impact every single day. As James puts, these decisive moments are a fork in the road, sending us in the direction of a productive path or an unproductive one. To avoid procrastination, the skill of 'Showing Up' says that we should start a new habit by taking baby steps, making it as easy as possible to take action. “A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first 2 minutes should be easy. What you want is a gateway habit that naturally leads you down a more productive path.” He calls it the 'Two-Minute Rule', meaning that new habits should take less than 2 minutes to do in the beginning. Once the habit is established we can improve and master the finer details.

[Chapter 14] In order to keep bad habits away is to make them difficult in the first place. There are 2 interesting strategies to improve our future behavior. [1] Make good choices in advance before we can fall victim to temptation in the future. James gives a personal example by sharing that whenever he is looking to cut calories he will ask the waiter to split his meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served. If, however, he waits for the meal to be served and tries to eat just half, that would never happen. [2] Make onetime actions that can automate our future habits and deliver increasing returns over time such as buying a good water filter, unsubscribing from unwanted emails, moving to a friendlier neighborhood, buying a standing desk, or setting up automatic bill pay.

[Section V : Make It Satisfying]

[Chapter 15] We should make sure to feel immediately satisfied after performing a new habit to increase the odds that the behavior will be repeated next time. “The human brain has evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.” For that, we can add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run.

[Chapter 16] Here we learn how to measure our progress by tracking our habits. The immediate satisfaction it delivers—as mentioned earlier in Chapter 15—is one of the many benefits that standout. Besides that, James says, “when we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path.” The most basic format to track our habits is to get a calendar and mark an X each time we stick with our routine. One of the most important passages of the entire book is as follows: “If you miss one day, try to get back into it as quickly as possible. The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly.”

[Chapter 17] In order to prevent bad habits and/or eliminate unhealthy behaviors, James says that we could either add an instant cost to the action or make it painful. A habit contract is also another strategy to hold our accountability: “It is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don't follow through. Then you find one to two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you.”

[Section VI : Advanced Techniques]

[Chapter 18] We learn how to distinguish habits when genes may or may not influence our performance especially for competitive activities. “One of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills.” James proposes us to set some time apart to explore new activities in the beginning, before shifting our focus to exploit them thoroughly.

[Chapter 19] When we find the sweet spot of our ability we tend to learn best and fastest. The ‘Goldilocks Rule’ states that ""humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.”

[Chapter 20] One downside of certain habits, James explains, is that we may stop paying attention to the little details and errors. To counterbalance that we should review and reflect on the process over time to remain conscious of our own performance. Using a simple chart to convey his message, we learn that “the process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized.”

PERSONAL THOUGHTS

Reading the book twice helped me take better notes and capture details. In the meantime, I thought about 3 simple strategies that could improve our adherence to new habits. Let me share these strategies here with you, and in the following section, I will describe how I managed to cultivate the first 3 new habits upon reading the book—following the system proposed by James together with these 3 strategies.

[1] The first strategy is about determining a 'commitment time frame' to avoid excuses during this initial trial period. A 1-month time frame is a fair commitment, choosing to start on the first day of the month to practice it every single day for a full month. Just at the end of the period, I will take the time to reflect and evaluate the pros and cons.

[2] The next one is to choose only 1 new habit each month. In doing so we become familiar with the practice intentionally while we develop a sense of purpose.

[3] Last, during the first month of any new habit, I noticed that if I spend time exploring the details and the benefits, my motivation stays high. It doesn't only help us create better practices, but it is also inspiring to learn from others who have succeeded previously by adding the same habit into their lives. Podcasts, articles, videos, books, online courses, tutorials, and blog posts are all good sources.

IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW HABITS

[Nov 1, 2018] I had been wanting to journal on a daily basis for many years but that had never happened. Although I have carried a notebook with me for quite a while, it has never worked as a real journal—a daily routine, when we sit down and write personal thoughts, intentions, and reflections at around the same time. Instead, it has been mostly used to take notes during meetings, to write down ideas and thoughts, to express travel memories, and to doodle. Today, after 3+ months, I haven't looked back once, and still can't believe it took me that long to start this daily habit. During the first month, I read blog posts, watched videos, and even read a short and inexpensive book to foster my creativity.

[Dec 1, 2018] I have been impressed by the physical capabilities we can develop through body movement. Although yoga has been a special part of my life since I was 18, I hadn't given proper attention to handstands. But now, after 2+ months practicing it every day, it is rewarding to see improvements on a weekly basis. Again, I definitely recommend watching videos and reading tutorials to find your favorite method. This is the perfect habit to stack at the end or in the middle of any physical movement practice you may enjoy.

[Jan 1, 2019] By now we know the benefits of cold showers—ranging from healthier skin appearance all the way to a more resilient perspective of the world. I had previously taken cold showers for 3 months in 2017, but it was a “goal” mindset instead of a “habit” mindset. After that trial I set aside and, although I have kept taking cold showers once or twice a week since then, I wished cold showers was the default mode. Now, after 1+ month, I can't see myself taking warm showers. After all, it is about intention. Again, we can learn uncountable benefits of cold showers by reading success stories. One of my inspirations was Wim Hof. It isn't comfortable in the beginning of any chosen day, but after 3-4 minutes, both my breath and thoughts calm down.

Putting them together, these 3 habits don't take more than 30 minutes of my day. While I spend about 10 minutes journaling and 10 more minutes practicing handstands, I save 5 minutes taking cold showers because I won't stay any longer than necessary.

RECOMMENDATION

[1] First, if you have watched videos, listened to podcasts, read articles and books on habit formation and, after all that, you feel satisfied, then, please, save your money and time.

[2] However, if you are like me, that even after reading a few books on building habits and having successfully added good habits to your life, feel that there is still room for improvement, this book can be a terrific addition.

[3] Last, if you haven't spent much time and energy discovering a good system to build lasting habits while breaking bad ones, please, read this book.

COMPLEMENTARY READINGS

[1] Game Changers, by Dave Asprey, exposed me to a wealth array of ideas/habits/tools that have helped me decide which new habit to build next. The book is divided into 46 laws.

[2] Essentialism, by Greg McKeown, helped me focus on less but more important tasks, giving clarity to what matters most. This is especially interesting to break bad habits.

[3] The Talent Code, by Daniel Coyle, brought more motivation when learning new skills based on the assumptions that we develop new talents through deep practices, finding our ignition identity, and having the right coach to guide us genuinely. I read it many years ago, then, a few years back, I read his following book called The Little Book of Talent—which is perhaps even more to the point.

[4] The Systems View of Life, by Fritjof Capra, enlightened my perspectives on how nature and living beings are systematically integrated. It is a profound and slightly academic book that can complement Atomic Habits especially to tie together the 4-step framework into the feedback loop system.

I sincerely hope you, too, have fun while building new habits.

Take care,

31,Audible Books & Originals,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Atomic Habits by James Clear is one of those rare books that I immediately read twice in a row. It is filled with dozens of science-backed and actionable nuggets of wisdom. Do you want to improve any habits in your life? I heartily recommend Atomic Habits to you! We are all driven by our habits - many of which are unconscious. Below are 9 quotes and takeaways from this life-changing book:

1. ""Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run."" Atomic Habits explains why the little things you do every day matters. Your little habits matter. It may not seem like a big deal to skip a workout or to be kind, but it is a big deal. Imagine if you improved your habits by only 1% every day. You'd be dramatically a different person in a year. Then imagine if you let your habits decline by 1% every day. You'd be in a much worse spot in life overall a year from now. Your little habits - atomic habits - count for a lot in the long run. What little habits are you improving upon (or neglecting...) today?

2. ""You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."" This is such an important point in the book. Oftentimes we focus on goals in our life, while neglecting to focus on the systems that help us achieve goals. As an example, I had a friend who had the goal to complete a triathlon. He achieved this goal! And then he quit working out for the next year and got out of shape... He was so focused on achieving a goal that he neglected his underlying systems of being healthy. Goal achievement can actually set us back if we don't get set up sustainable systems. Get the systems right and then we'll indeed also achieve our goals. Systems > Goals.

3. ""Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity."" I love this quote from the book. Every action - every habit - you take casts a vote for the type of person you want to become. Do you want to be a more organized person? When you develop habits and systems that organize your life, you are casting votes for thinking of yourself as an organized person. You think to yourself, ""hey, I'm an organized person."" And then you reinforce that belief with your habits and actions - a virtuous cycle! The flip side of this can be true too. What if you often show up late to meetings? You're casting votes that may make you think ""well, I'm just a person that is always late."" An un-virtuous cycle. Be careful to make sure that your habits and ultimately your beliefs cast votes for the type of person you want to become and, indeed, who you truly are.

4. ""How long does it actually take to form a new habit? You just need to get your reps in."" Atomic Habits answers the question of ""how much time does it take to form a new habit"" with a better answer of : X number of actions. Meaning, you may need to simply complete a new habit 100 times for it to stick, which could be done in 3 days or 3 weeks or 3 months, depending on the new habit. It is better to think of forming new habits in terms of consistently taking action, versus trying to stick to a habit for just X number of days. Get your reps in.

5. ""Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits."" The inverse of this is also true - increase friction between you and your bad habits! I think about this a lot when it comes to eating healthy. I need to reduce friction by having healthy food in the house and healthy snacks at work. And I need to increase friction by not having candy in the house or in my office! Out of sight, out of mind. In sight, and I eat it. :) (which of course reminds me of the Dad joke I often tell my girls: ""I'm on a seafood diet. I see food and I eat it...)

6. ""Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do."" This is a powerful concept. I put this in practice by only ""watching TV"" when I'm on the treadmill. I am able to run at a 6 MPH pace and watch TV or videos on the iPad when I'm on a treadmill. So, I generally only watch sporting events or movies or 80s music videos on YouTube when I'm running on the treadmill. This approach actually allows me to run longer if I want to watch a full half of a game, for example. And 80s music videos will often give me the energy to run that extra mile. :) Think about a new habit you want to start and how you can bundle it with an action you're already taking. Stack them together - i.e. habit stacking.

7. ""Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and 'don't break the chain.'"" Atomic Habits does a nice job of explaining the importance of tracking your habits for success. What gets measured gets managed. One of my favorite habit trackers is a FitBit/Apple Watch, which tracks steps, heart rate, sleep, weight and can even track food intake/calories, if you input this data. My behavior definitely changes thanks to these habit trackers. Atomic Habits gives you additional habit tracker resources.

8. ""Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately."" We all will have days where we fall off the bandwagon and our habits go in reverse. Well, that's okay for one day. Don't let it happen twice. Get back on track as soon as possible. (And, yes, sometimes we miss a habit two days in row. Just don't let it become three days...)

9. Author James Clear gets to the point quickly in Atomic Habits and with actionable advice. James has been blogging about habits, health, happiness, creativity and productivity since 2012. Check out a sampling of his writing at his website. James is also fun to follow on Twitter. Atomic Habits has 20 relatively short chapters that open with compelling stories and end with helpful chapter summaries. If you listen to books on Audible, I highly recommend the audio book as James reads this book very passionately.",positive
32,Audible Books & Originals,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"If you imagine the structure of your life as a brick building, your habits are the bricks. They are the foundation that allow you to lead the life you desire, the life of your design. The reason habit formation is so important is because the conscious brain can only focus on one task at a time. Rote habits are carried out by the subconscious (or nonconscious) mind, and the more aspects of your daily life that you can pass off to your subconscious, the more mental bandwidth you have available to concentrate on other problems.

In his book, Clear lays out four laws that influence habit formation: Make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying. Each of these laws govern both our good habits and our bad habits, and they are the roadmap for change. For example, if we want to start exercising first thing in the morning, we can make it obvious by putting our running sneakers next to the bed the night before. For another example, if we are trying to quit a bad habit like smoking, we might make it difficult (the reverse of making it easy) by locking our cigarettes up in a place that is difficult to get to.

The two biggest cues that activate a habit are place and time. If you eat breakfast at the same time every morning, your body will learn to get hungry at that time. Similarly, if you always smoke cigarettes in your garage, when you go in there to do your laundry, your body will crave nicotine. This is because our “environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.” We often think that changing bad habits into good ones requires diligent will-power, and while this internal approach does sometimes work, it is not the only solution: sometimes changing the external environment that we are existing in can be just as impactful. This is because “our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.” If your relationship with your garage is that it is a quiet place where you go to smoke, then anytime you go there for any other reason, you will be triggered to smoke. You must change your relationship to your garage in order to curb the desire to smoke every time you enter.

The biggest misconception about habits is the difference between setting goals and building systems. “The purpose of setting goals is to win the game,” Clear writes, “the purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.” You might start a habit because you are motivated to do so, but you’ll stick with it because it becomes a part of your identity. It is the difference between saying to yourself “I am going to lay 100 bricks” and “I am going to be the best brick layer I can be.” Achieving a goal only changes your life momentarily, whereas adjusting your system changes your life forever. This is the purpose of creating strong and healthy habits: to improve your life one small brick at a time.

Reading this book led me to a personal revelation about my writing. When I first started writing book reviews, I set the goal of completing three a month. This inevitably became tiresome. Instead of remaining chained to this goal, I decided to change my mindset: Instead of writing three a month, I simply write as many as I can with the time that I have. I may have some months where I only produce one or two book reviews, but this will not take any wind out of my sails. My goal is no longer to write three reviews a month, but instead it is to be the best writer I can be. Reading and writing book reviews started off as something I was motivated to do because I wanted to share my favorite books with the world. Now it has become a part of my identity. I am a writer.

I humbly thank you for reading!",positive
33,Audible Books & Originals,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I’ve read several books on habits and this is by far the best. The author packs the book with lots of useful nuggets and methods around habit formation and change. His main thesis is that very small habits that help reinforce a strong identity will compound over time and lead to meaningful changes.

The author suggests that most people see habits as the necessary means to some specific goal or event, after which the habit may cease to be meaningful. He calls these “outcome-based” habits. However, instilling habits that resonate and fortify a personal identity, such as “athlete” or “health nut”, etc. are much more likely to stick and accumulate. These habits he calls “identity-based”.

He focuses on “systems” over “habits”. Systems drive behavior and beliefs drive systems. He talks about how our language often reflects our beliefs and how making small changes in how we describe ourselves can have outsized effects on our identity and behavior. Ex: A recently former smoker is offered a cigarette and says “no thanks, I’m trying to quit” reflects an identity that still sees themselves as a smoker as opposed to someone who may respond “No thanks, I’m not a smoker”.

The author introduces concepts such as “The Plateau of Latent Potential” and “The Valley of Disappointment” which describe the gap between expected short-term results and actual, delayed results. Early progress is often hard to measure and therefore often not obvious, when in fact changes are happening beneath the surface as your brain and body slowly rewire. This latent progress can demotivate us as our expectations often don’t match what we see or feel.

Like most other good books on habits, the author spends time explaining the ‘habit loop” process of Cue, Crave, Routine, and Reward. He emphasizes how architecting one’s environment to help reinforce positive cues is far more effective than relying on willpower and motivation. Our environment is the most powerful influencer of our habits.

The author also presents several examples of the power of just showing up. He calls this the “Two Minute Rule”. At the beginning of habit formation, what’s most important is simply showing up. Many people won’t start a new habit because they view the habit as being large and daunting. But reducing the new behavior to just 2-minutes, and only 2-minutes, can help ease you into the routine. Other concepts include Habit Stacking, Habit Tracking, and Accountability Partners.

Overall I found the book enlightening, engaging, and well written. If you’re looking to engineer a better life through habit change, Atomic Habits is a great resource.",positive

35,Audible Books & Originals,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I've read a lot of books on changing behavior and building habits and James Clear's Atomic Habits is my new favorite. This book is different from others in the way it covers an enormous amount of ground in the larger area of self-improvement while seamlessly tying all these ideas back into the central theme of habits.

One of the core concepts in Atomic Habits is to focus on the small improvement. The impact a 1% improvement per day can make may appear negligible at first, but Clear makes a compelling argument that in the case of habits, thinking small produces the biggest results over time. ""Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement,"" explains Clear.

Over the months and years, the accumulated effect of small habitual daily behaviors is staggering. Early in the book we are also warned that this compounding works both ways, so we'd better make sure we're making it work in the positive direction, not for the negative.

This is a concept I was introduced to years ago under a different name - Kaizen - the Japanese term for continuous incremental improvement. What's different and new in this book is how the concept is applied specifically to building habits.

I found the information introduced in chapter two about behavior change at the identity level to be spot-on. You're also given a simple two-step process for changing your identity and this one idea alone is incredibly powerful.

In chapter three, we are introduced to the habit loop - cue, craving, response, reward - and we learn how to build good habits in 4 simple steps and break bad habits in 4 simple steps.

One of those steps to habit formation, which goes hand in hand with the 1% concept, is how to make it not only small, but easy. In the chapters that follow, this is exactly what you find out.

Other ideas of great value that stood out included, habit stacking (the best way to form a new habit), habit tracking, habit shaping and how to design your environment - physical and social - for habit building success. You learn the truth about self-control, how to stop procrastinating and how to use implementation intentions, temptation bundling and motivational rituals. The book is simply packed with actionable ideas, tactics and strategies.

Virtually every idea in the book is useful and resonated with me. While I may not agree that we should ""forget about goals,"" I agree with one of Clear's core principles in the book - that we must develop systems for change. If we only focus on goals and don't develop systems and a focus on the process, we risk falling into a number of goal-related traps which ultimately lead to stagnation. With the right systems, we're rewarded with continuous improvement on a lifelong journey of success.

Another difference between Atomic Habits and other books in this genre is that while it's based on science it doesn't bog you down with unnecessary details of the research. Clear's book is intensely practical, giving you a huge toolkit of organized and named strategies you can apply immediately to create and strengthen positive habits and stop the negative ones.

The book is conversational, and includes many interesting stories, making it easy to read - and hard to put down (I read it cover to cover in one day).

It's possible this might become your most highlighted personal improvement book because every page is so chocked full of memorable and quotable gems of advice.",positive
36,Audible Books & Originals,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I began reading this book with very high expectations and it did not disappoint. I, myself, am a big believer of the power of habits and have done a lot of research on the topic. Yet I learned a lot, especially the clarity with which the author presents his ideas. Big parts of the book were, in some sense, confirmation that I was doing things the right way, since I was oftentimes thinking ""oh yeah, that's similar to what I'm doing"". Still, parts of the book and strategies proposed were new to me and really helped add habit strategies to my toolbox. As mentioned though, the best thing about this book is the clarity with which the ideas are presented and the way they blend together.

This quote from the last chapter summarizes the ""Four Laws of Behavior Change"" (that the book is about) well: "" (1) Sometimes a habit will be hard to remember and you'll need to make it obvious. (2) Other times you won't feel like starting and you'll need to make it attractive. (3) In many cases, you may find that a habit will be too difficult and you'll need to make it easy. (4) And sometimes, you won't feel like sticking with it and you'll need to make it satisfying.""

Here's some of the notes I made while reading the book:
- Habits are like compound interest in self-improvement.
- Outcomes are a lagging measure of habits.
- The ""Valley of Disappointment"" is the period where you are putting in the hard work but still seeing no results. --> but remember, your work is not being wasted, it is being stored.
- You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.
- Your habits shape your identity and your identity shapes your habit. It's a feedback loop. (reverse causation for the nerds here)
- Make clear plans - Use the ""Implementation Intention"": When X happens, then I will do Y OR if Z happens, then I will do W.
- Use ""Habit Stacking"": After behavior X, I will immediately perform behavior Y OR If Z happens, I will immediately perform behavior W. (i.e. As soon as I begin boiling water for tea, I will do 10 burpees). Also, be very clear. (i.e. I will do the burpees next to the fridge in the kitchen, or whatever, you get the idea. As long as it works, it's good!)
- People with high self-control are the ones who structure their environments in such a way to minimize exposure to tempting situations.
- Use ""Temptation Bundling"" + ""Habit Stacking"": After X, i will Y. Right after Y, I will immediately Z,
where X - habit I already do, Y - habit I need to do, Z - habit I want to do. (The anticipation of a reward is what gives us the most motivation - and not the reward itself.)
- Do something you enjoy before a difficult habit.
- Planning can sometimes be a form of procrastination because it can make you feel like you are making progress (while you are not).
- Make your habits as easy as possible to start (i.e. do one set of abs, read one page of my book) - This is called a ""Gateway Habit"". and it helps to reinforce your identity of who you are which will itself help motivate you to keep going.
- Prime your environment for future use - ""resetting your environment"" (i.e. Take out your coffee and mug the night before, make your bed perfectly, to remove the sense of sleep / bedroom if you'll be working from your bedroom)
- Use pre-commitment devices to make it harder/ impossible to deviate from good habits.
- Even one minute of a bad habit (i.e. checking instagram) can manifest into a lot (i.e. getting lost in time browsing instagram).
- Put some immediate reward into good habits / immediate punishment to bad habits.
- Create a habit tracker / calendar to provide a sense of accomplishment and motivation.
- Rule: Never miss a habit twice! (life gets in the way, but don't let it derail you off your path)
- Finding what you are naturally gifted in will make good habits easier. To do that ask the following questions. (1) What feels like fun to me but work to others? (2) What makes me lose track of time? (3) Where do I get greater returns than the average person? (4) What comes naturally to me?
- You can also win by being different, by rewriting the rules (i.e. by combining your unique set of skills)
- Periodic reflection and review can enable the long-term improvement of all habits - identity building.

Finally, some quotes I liked:
- ""Really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.""
- ""The greatest threat to success is not failure, but boredom.""
- ""You have to fall in love with boredom.""
- ""Improvement is not just about learning habits, it's also about fine-tuning them.""
- ""Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.""

And my favorite:
- ""It is remarkable what you can build if you just don't stop.""",positive

It also helped to stop comparing myself to other people.

Negative reviews point out that nothing in this book hasn't been covered elsewhere. That topics in here are often phrases you have heard throughout your life. I argue that this is the entire point.

Self-help is a rabbit hole that can lead you with a pile of books, podcasts, and Youtube presentations of motivational bullcrap that drain all of the time you are supposed to actually be doing things.

40,Audible Books & Originals,It Ends with Us,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"So much hype over this book! I've read dozens and dozens of KU Romances across every genre - billionaire, mafia, same sex, enemies to lovers, second chance, dark, light, everything in between. There is some really good content over there so I finally wanted to see how they compared to one of the best selling romance novels of all time. Selfishly I also wanted to see how Hoover's writing (this is my first of hers i've read) compared to Sylvia Day whose Bared series I loved Books 1-3.

Overall I give this a 4 stars. It didn't completely bowl me over but overall really good. One little admission is that I totally skipped the pages and pages and pages of ""journal entries"" aka back story for Lily and Atlas, and guess what? Still was able to figure out the story just fine :) It came across to me as filler and really slowed the plot down but I know some readers love those juicy details. I just wanted to get back to the main story line and honestly some of the entries were like 12 pages long. If you wanna do the same, I won't tell anybody and I promise you won't be lost.

Spoilers ahead.
This book honestly wasn't as dark as I thought it would be given all the talk of domestic violence. I thought it would be scene after scene, but there were only 3 incidents in the whole book, 2 of which were somewhat unintentional and/or partially happenstance, while the third was just nauseatingly purposeful. Some of the MC (Lily) reactions seemed a little fake or contrived, and especially I DID not like it when she informed Ryle WHILE HE HELD HIS NEWBORN BABY that she wanted a divorce. Surely she could have waited a day? I don't like when books make me dislike a protagonist and up until this very point at the end, I had really liked Lily.

Ryle and his thought processes were right on. Having experience with men with major emotional trauma this really hit home for me and seemed incredibly realistic. There are two types of abusers in my opinion - the ones who are truly mean and don't care that they are hurting others and the the ones with the demons they can't control. Him putting on Lily by saying ""help me"" as though its up to her to heal him was really on point (if very, very wrong - he is responsible for his own healing).

Anyway, overall pretty well done if a little too much filler in the middle of the book. The ending was pretty superb and that Epilogue! I have to admit I was rooting for Atlas the whole time, but I have a weak spot for rescuers. Unfortunately I didn't really get invested in any of the characters enough to want to spend the money or time on It Starts with Us, which starts where EWU leaves off. I think I'll move on to Ugly Love which I heard was steamier and is a little more along my preference lines.

TBH if you are looking for pure drama and emotional angst Sylvia Day's Book 1 of Bared series is going to leave you gasping, its way more fast paced. Unfortunately though the series drops off in quality after book 3, and one thing CoHo fans love is her consistency.

41,Audible Books & Originals,It Ends with Us,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"This book.... OHHH my gosh. This book was so heart-wrenching, yet so beautiful at the same time. Coming from someone who has experienced domestic violence in the past it really hits home. When I first bought this book I didn't know what to except, but it wasn't this. It was everything I could've hoped for and MORE. I loved the way she portrayed Lily. She was so courageous, bold, relatable and perfect in all the right ways. I cannot wait for book 2!!! Once I finished, I couldn't stop crying for a whole hour straight. I can't even remember turning pages because it had me hooked that good!! READ IT READ IT READ IT!

*SPOILERS*]

First off, some of these reviews piss me off, especially the ones that are geared toward the main character Lily.

""Why did Colleen have her stay with someone who was constantly abusing her and treating her as so""?
""I was so pissed she got right with Atlas right after the whole thing with Ryle happened, that would not happen in real life...""

First off, if you have ever experienced domestic violence in your life you would know how hard it is to leave the situation. Second, did you even read the book? Lily clearly states her confusion with either staying or leaving. It's not like she was staying with him because she liked the abuse?! Some of yawl's reviews seriously get to me. Imagine falling in love with someone who was absolutely perfect in your eyes and treated you in all the ways you'd ever imagine. You then get tied down... He starts to abuse you... Does things to you that you never thought this man who loved you SO much could possibly do?!? But it happens. It's not that easy to up in leave... If you TRULY knew what it is like to experience domestic abuse you would know that. So please stop getting mad at Lily for taking so long to leave! The whole thing about her getting with Atlas so fast after the whole dealio with Ryle ended, was PERFECT in my eyes. People are getting mad at how quickly she got back with him, but he was her safe place and FIRST true love (who matter-of-fact she never fell out of love with). I would've done the exact same dang thing!",positive
42,Audible Books & Originals,It Ends with Us,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I have never been inspired to write a book review. This is my first. I read all the critical reviews, but the subject matter of this book hit a very sensitive nerve for me. First of all, for those who thought the book was too sensual or too emotional, I must venture a guess this subject matter is something they have never lived or even thought was possible.
Domestic abuse has many sides and many questions. If you have not been a victim, it might be easy to say,”Why didn’t you leave?” This book answers many questions and explores the victims and abusers viewpoints. The most prominent quotation in this book for me is, “There are no bad people, only people who do bad things.” I believe the circumstances of our childhoods shape us into the adults we become, even more than genetics. The traumas we have to survive and the way we are made to feel about ourselves stay with us.
I was a survivor of my parents abuse of each other. It was not just my father, but also my mother who fought violently with each other. I was able to go to university and leave the trauma physically, but not emotionally.
I married the first man who proposed so I didn’t have to go home.
I withstood his verbal and physical abuse for 28 years. He stopped hurting me before my bruises and choking so as not to send me to the hospital. I stayed with him for 28 years because he was a good father and my daughters loved him.
I loved him because when he was good, he was very good. Was I stupid? Was I afraid to go out on my own? Yes. My children came first. I would endure anything for their safety and happiness.
This amazing book addresses both sides of abuse, from each perspective. The heartbreak of having to decide your future with a man you love with all your heart, who loves you with everything he has in him, but who also has demons he is unable to control.
Please read this book. It will give you sight into this ongoing tragedy between men and women. Withhold your judgment until the end, if you have the wisdom to do so",positive
43,Audible Books & Originals,It Ends with Us,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"*Review originally posted on Goodreads*

'I wish cutting my feelings off for the person who hurt me was as easy as I used to think it would be. Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.'

It Ends With Us was beautifully complicated. It was hot and cold. Up and down. Good and bad. Beautiful and ugly... I'm still trying to figure out how I really feel about it all because I'm genuinely torn on how I want to perceive this storyline. I loved it but in all honesty, I really do think I hate it as well. Not the ""I-hate-you-Colleen-Hoover-stop-writing-books-and-find-a-different-career"" type of hate but rather ""I-hate-you-Colleen-Hoover-for-making-me-hate-everything-that-I-came-to-love"" kind of hate because it pretty much summarizes all my thoughts and feelings about It Ends With Us in one sentence.

My opinions were completely divided. One side of me, the hopeless romantic, was utterly unsatisfied and angry with the outcome of the story. The opposite side, the one that's all about women's empowerment, was cheering on #TeamLily like it was Independence Day.

Rather than trying to sugarcoat my thoughts, I'm just going to be completely honest. I was 100 percent team Ryle from the very first time we met him. Just like Lily, I fell in love with every word and every gesture that rolled off of his body. I. WAS. HOOKED. It also didn't help that I kept fantasizing Doctor Mike as Ryle Kincaid. *heart eyes emoji* I loved his ambition. His personality. His confidence. To be honest, I think I might've loved Ryle even more than Lily did but that's another story for another day. That more than likely explains why I took the second half of this book like a blow to the gut.

Once we got to the second half of the book, that's where it started going a bit downhill for me as a Ryle and Lily shipper. Every happy moment that ever happened between my ship came barreling down as it collided with pain and abuse. I was angry. I was thrashing. I was yelling at the pages in front of me, ""Why are you doing this Colleen?!"" But most importantly, I was just heartbroken to see such a beautiful couple become so toxic. Everything I loved about the first half of the book was slowly unraveling right before my very eyes as if it never really existed in the first place. I can't even remember how many times I wanted to put the book down because my hopeless romantic self just couldn't handle it anymore. But I just kept on reading because I was guiltily hoping that Ryle and Lily would still have their happy ending despite all that had happened. :/ Sadly, this was where I was torn the most.

I have the upmost respect for Lily. She is definitely one of my favorite female characters that Colleen has ever created because she did what a lot of us would've struggled to do in the end: walk away. Lily was such a strong character and I admire her so much for having the strength to stand up for herself. There were numerous times towards the end of the book where I knew I probably would've gave in and forgave Ryle for his actions but Lily was inflexible. She was in a tough position but she put her foot down and demanded better for herself. In the end, no matter if I ship Ryle/Lily or Atlas/Lily, I'm glad that Lily was able to find peace for her and Emmy.

As for Atlas, I liked him but I didn't love him. Definitely nowhere near my love for Ryle. I wasn't exactly rooting for Atlas but I wouldn't have minded if Lily chose him in the end. However, I still very much preferred Ryle regardless. I just felt that Atlas was the typical knight in shining armor. Typical good guy you run to. His background story was interesting but him as a character... not so much. He just felt so ordinary and predictable. I wanted to ship Atlas and Lily because let's face it, the signs were practically being shoved down our throats, and although the relationship between Ryle and Lily was developing, Atlas's presence was a like a thorn on your side you just couldn't shake off. But I just couldn't bring myself to ship them blindly like I did with Ryle and Lily.

Unfortunately, I was too far gone and too far in love with the idea of Ryle and Lily to make room for Atlas and because of that, I'm not sure if I'll ever be fully satisfied with that ending. I was happy that Lily was no longer a victim of domestic abuse. I'm glad that after all that happened between them, Lily and Ryle parted on good terms. I'll forever be heartbroken over the idea of what could've been. And I feel indifferent to Lily and Atlas. Sorry not sorry, Atlas. That basically sums up all my feelings in a nutshell.

To be honest, I was actually feeling a bit more bitter than I'm making it seem after that ending. But after reading the author's note, it really put things in perspective for me and made me look at the story with brand new eyes. I developed a new understanding and appreciation for the story behind the story.

I was dying for Ryle and Lily to have their happy ending. Until the very end, I was still rooting for them. It's such an ugly confession to make especially when the couple you're rooting for is toxic and abusive. And I think I feel this way because I never, and hopefully I never will, had to experience abuse. I don't know what it's like and what goes on in the minds of the abused. Colleen did such an excellent job at creating the perfectly imperfect man that was Ryle. Abuse in books has always been a trigger for me and if it were any other book I think I would've put this book down by the first incident of abuse. But Colleen just made you fall so deeply in love with a character that even you couldn't bring yourself to hate him even if you wanted to. YOU were the Lily of this story. But unfortunately, I don't think my Lily would've had the courage to leave. I really wish I could say that I would leave in an instant, but I think I would honestly be lying to myself. You can tell yourself that if you were in Lily's position you would leave in a blink of an eye, but things wouldn't be as easily said and done if you were the one who was actually experiencing it all. And in truth, I think this is exactly what Colleen wanted us to actually sit down and think about because victims who've experienced abuse wouldn't be rooting for Ryle and Lily. I wouldn't be rooting for Ryle and Lily. It just goes to show how much of a struggle it really is to walk away from someone you love and loves you back in all the wrong ways. I usually never read the author's notes after the book but I'm really glad I took the time to read Colleen's story. It really did make me see the situation from a different perspective.

I'd been having a bad CoHo streak for three books in a row (if you're curious, the books were — in order — Hopeless, November 9, and Too Late) and for a moment there I was beginning to think that I was doomed to never enjoy another book written by Colleen Hoover again. But PRAISE. It Ends With Us restored my faith completely in the CoHo hype. Not that I was ever planning NOT to read any more of Colleen's books! Colleen Hoover is 100 percent my favorite auto-buy author. I will always buy her books no matter if I end up loving them or not, and with good reason because Colleen is such an exceptional writer. It Ends With Us still wasn't able to top Ugly Love as my favorite CoHo book of all time but I really enjoyed this book more than I thought I would.",positive

Lily’s character was something I felt was someone I can relate to because I have seen how domestic violence can ruin a person and how hard it is to walk away from that person. It takes a lot of courage to do that, and the way this book’s plot developed was from a girl ready to accept the fate of the beaten house wife , but then she knew this isn’t what she was in Boston for .

I was taken completely off-guard with this one. I am probably one of the few who have never read one of her books although I've been hearing the hype for a while. So I started this one with an open mind, like I do most books I read, not knowing what to expect and letting the story take me where I needed to go. I noticed the normal things right away. Her writing style is very good, and the pace of the story is spot-on. I became completely invested by the middle of the story. I was in love with the characters and pulling for the main character and her future. And then, bam, I'm facing the dilemma Lily faces. Because I feel the exact same way she does, and her shock and indecision is mine. I won't tell you any more. Maybe you don't read the synopsis ahead of time either. But I will tell you that this is a book well-worth reading. And reading the Author's Notes afterward, simply said, sent me straight over the edge with recognition.

50,Audible Books & Originals,Fire & Blood (HBO Tie-in Edition): 300 Years Before A Game of Thrones,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"George R.R. Martin released A Dance with Dragons in 2011 and we've been waiting eleven years for the sequel, The Winds of Winter. However, that doesn't mean that he hasn't been active during this time. He has been laying the groundwork for multiple new television series, wrote part of The World of Ice and Fire, and hinted at continuing his Dunk and Egg series that I quite enjoy. However, I think the thing he accomplished most in that time is Fire and Blood.

I should note I don't hold the long wait between books against George R.R. Martin before I continue. I'm one of the people who believes the issue is less not working on it than the fact the story has grown like tree branches from the main trunk with no end in sight. People want the story of Daenerys, Jon, Arya, and Tyrion but he's become caught up in the tales of Young Griff as well as Penny the Jester. Mind you, my suggestion would be to do side-series and have a hundred books like Dragonlance but I'm terrible that way.

Fire and Blood is a crypto history of Westeros, specifically the Rise and Fall of the Targaryen Dynasty starting with Aegon the Conqueror then moving through each successive generation until reaching Aerys the Mad. This is an expansion of the history found in The World of Ice and Fire as well as the Song of Fire and Ice books themselves.

This might seem to be boring, but George R.R. Martin maintains his deft touch creating fascinating relationships and bringing characters to life that could each be the base of their own series of books or shows. George remains perfectly capable of creating vivid personalities that leap from the page even when they don't have any dialogue or appearance on page save descriptions about them.

My favorite of the Targaryen dynasties is the Dance of the Dragons between Rhaenyra Targaryen versus Aegon the Second and his mother, Alicent Hightower. This is going to be the basis of the House of the Dragon show so I'm not going to get to into the details, but it is a fascinating story of primogeniture, backstabbing, love, and dragons. The fact it's about a Targaryen Civil War that has dragonriders on both sides means that I am very excited to see it onscreen.

This is primarily a work for those who absolutely love Westeros history and world-building, but it is never boring despite being a history text. George is smart enough to keep all the salacious and twisted details about the Targaryens intact throughout the text while real-life history often downplays these elements. Was Aegon I's eldest child really his or a singer’s? Was Maegor the Cruel resurrected as a zombie? What really was going on at Summerhall?

George R.R. Martin is the master of the ""Mystery Box"" form of storytelling and leaves all manner of breadcrumbs as well as clues to lead his readers on. However, unlike the majority of said users of this trope ala Chris Carter and JJ Abrams, it's clear he does have answers to the mysteries he invokes. There's all sorts of riddles for the ages spread throughout the book but you aren't left unsatisfied either because the book often offers their own suggestions as to what might have happened.

The art of the book is black and white compared to the vibrant colors of The World of Fire and Ice. Still, the art is fantastic, and helps add to the book's appeal. Still, I must admit that I'm a huge fan of the character art in other Westeros-related media and feel like they could have inserted more of that here for the benefit of readers. It's not like George R.R. Martin or the publishers can't afford it.

In conclusion, Fire and Blood is a fantastic companion piece to both A Song of Ice and Fire as well as the Game of Thrones media empire. If you're not fantastically into the world-building and history of the setting, though, you will probably be disappointed. This is not a novel but more a very well-done pseudo-history of events. A summary of the good parts, really, that is done in an entertaining and well-formatted style. It also spoils the hell out of a lot of potential projects that may someday be shows.",positive
51,Audible Books & Originals,Fire & Blood (HBO Tie-in Edition): 300 Years Before A Game of Thrones,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"I rarely bother posting a review of a book with nearly a hundred reviews. For one, neither the book nor the prospective buyer need my thoughts in order to make an informed decision. And second, for me it requires some soul searching and a good deal of thought when I am trying to shed some light that others might find of interest. In other words, I cannot simply state, ""Loved it,"" or ""Hated it,"" and call that a review. And, further, I abhor reviews that tell us all the intricate details of a plot and then go on and try to read the novel. Okay, now you know, I am a stubborn curmudgeon. If that annoys you, at least you can't say I didn't warn you...

My review of Fire & Blood is sure to be a different take than any other review. In such light,. My review may be the least helpful to most readers. Why? I have not yet successfully read any works of Mr. Martin, because I find them a daunting challenge. Note that I state challenge, not that his writing is unappealing or uninteresting. What I mean is, I greatly respect his ability to weave great yarns. I just have difficulty in immersing myself into the worlds he creates.

Anyway, I decided to approach his works from a different angle. I chose to read the history he prepared, then I will move on to Game of Thrones.

I mention all this so you can skip my review if you are already a Martin fan, because what little light I might shed on the topic probably will be of little use or interest to you.

On with my review…

BLUSH FACTOR: You probably won’t want to read this story to your children aged 13 and younger due to three eff-words and a reference to men and sheep. Unless, that is, you have raised your children to on a farm and providing you have a sense of humor regarding sheep and find them prettier than the local maidens… Okay, I am parroting Martin’s humor at location 5406.

POV: Third person.

WRITING & EDITING: Readers tend to gage the writing of history somewhat differently than fiction. At least I do. With a history I don’t expect quite the same sort of flow. With “Fire & Blood” we don’t get the same flow as with, say, Game of Thrones. But, since we don’t expect to, we can more readily accept such ebb and flow as exists in “Fire & Blood.”

ADVENTURE: Yes, there is plenty of adventure, even if it is not as layered through as creative writing would be in an epic story of conquest. To better show the adventure and character building that does exist in “Fire & Blood,” please refer to the below excerpt.

EXCERPT

‘…his summons. Lastly he descended upon the seat of House Doggett, reducing it to ash. The fires claimed the lives of Ser Joffrey’s father, mother, and young sister, along with their sworn swords, serving men, and chattel. As pillars of smoke rose all through the westerlands and the riverlands, Vhagar and Balerion turned south. Another Lord Hightower, counseled by another High Septon, had opened the gates of Oldtown during the Conquest, but now it seemed as if the greatest and most populous city in Westeros must surely burn.

Thousands fled Oldtown that night, streaming from the city gates or taking ship for distant ports. Thousands more took to the streets in drunken revelry. “This is a night for song and sin and drink,” men told one another, “for come the morrow, the virtuous and the vile burn together.” Others gathered in septs and temples and ancient woods to pray they might be spared. In the Starry Sept, the High Septon railed and thundered, calling down the wroth of the gods upon the Targaryens. The archmaesters of the Citadel met in conclave. The men of the City Watch filled sacks with sand and pails with water to fight the fires they knew were coming. Along the city walls, crossbows, scorpions, spitfires, and spear-throwers were hoisted onto the battlements in hopes of bringing down the dragons when they appeared. Led by Ser Morgan Hightower, a younger brother of the Lord of Oldtown, two hundred Warrior’s Sons spilled forth from their chapterhouse to defend His High Holiness, surrounding the Starry Sept with a ring of steel. Atop the Hightower, the great beacon fire turned a baleful green as Lord Martyn Hightower called his banners. Oldtown waited for the dawn, and the coming of the dragons.

And the dragons came. Vhagar first, as the sun was rising, then Balerion, just before midday. But they found the gates of the city open, the battlements unmanned, and the banners of House Targaryen, House Tyrell, and House Hightower flying side by side atop the city walls. The Dowager Queen Visenya was the first to learn the news. Sometime during the blackest hour of that long and dreadful night, the High Septon had died.

A man of three-and-fifty, as tireless as he was fearless, and to all appearances in robust good health, this High Septon had been renowned for his strength. More than once he had preached for a day and a night without taking sleep or nourishment. His sudden death shocked the city and dismayed his followers. Its causes are debated to this day. Some say that His High Holiness took his own life, in what was either the act of a craven afraid to face the wroth of King Maegor, or a noble sacrifice to spare the goodfolk of Oldtown from dragonfire. Others claim the Seven struck him down for the sin of pride, for heresy, treason, and arrogance.

Many and more remain certain he was murdered…but by whom? Ser Morgan Hightower did the deed at the command of his lord brother, some say (and Ser Morgan was seen entering and leaving the High Septon’s privy chambers that night). Others point to the Lady Patrice Hightower, Lord Martyn’s maiden aunt and a reputed witch (who did indeed seek an audience with His High Holiness at dusk, though he was alive when she departed). The archmaesters of the Citadel are also suspected, though whether they made use of the dark arts, an assassin, or a poisoned scroll is still a matter of some debate (messages went back and forth between the Citadel and the Starry Sept all night). And there are still others who hold them all blameless and lay the High Septon’s death at the door of another rumored sorceress, the Dowager Queen Visenya Targaryen.

The truth will likely never be known…but the swift reaction of Lord Martyn when word reached him at the Hightower is beyond dispute. At once he dispatched his own knights to disarm and arrest the Warrior’s Sons, amongst them his own brother. The city gates were opened, and Targaryen banners raised along the walls. Even before Vhagar’s wings were sighted, Lord Hightower’s men were…’

BOTTOM LINE

I enjoyed this fiction that felt like a true history. I confess that I enjoyed the Audible edition a bit more than the Kindle edition, but, for me, that is becoming the case with most reading. I read the Kindle edition when I can, and listen to the professional narration edition while commuting or otherwise enjoying the countryside in what “The People’s Almanac” referred to as ‘The Empty Quarter.” Listening to “Fire & Blood” while cruising through these wind-blown prairies, I found myself speculating that perhaps, just perhaps, when the ancient ones entered these lands several eons ago, they may have slew dragons and brute goliaths to wrestle the Upper Midwest free from some precursors of the human race…THAT is one mark of a good writer of fantasy, the learned one some refer to as George R. R. Martin.

The one downside of this epic history is that this book is only the first volume and the author himself admits that he has other pressing epics to bring forth before he can get around to writing the conclusion. In that sense, this book ends without being complete. An annoyance to me and, I’m certain, many other readers.

52,Audible Books & Originals,Fire & Blood (HBO Tie-in Edition): 300 Years Before A Game of Thrones,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"J. R. R. Tolkien labored at his mythology for a majority of his adult life, from the trenches of World War I until his death. He mostly thought it unpublishable. He was interested in the great histories, in the sweeping sagas, in the stories that were written not as modern novels, but as texts that might have jumped straight out of the world he created. Some of Tolkien's mythological material made it into 'The Lord of the Rings.' Much of it did not. He wanted to publish the histories--the Silmarillion saga--alongside the books we all know today, but the publishers turned him down repeatedly. He died without seeing any of that work published, and when his son Christopher tried to make one cohesive text from the massive amounts of material, much of it was bastardized. Only later did Christopher edit and release over a dozen volumes of original texts, showing us a bit more of the scope of the history Tolkien had imagined.

Why am I telling you this about Tolkien in a review for GRR Martin? This should seem fairly obvious by now: GRR Martin has the same longing Tolkien did. He has the same love of the grand, sweeping historical epic. So far he has been giving us his 'Lord of the Rings,' his drama of the minutiae, but in the process he got caught up in the grand and glorious visions of the Targaryens, just as Tolkien was swept up into the glories of the First Age. It’s no mistake this book is being called the “GRRMillion.”

Martin's popularity is granting him a chance that Tolkien unfortunately never had in his lifetime: To create his myth IN FULL. To give us the grand sweep of things in the greater world, beyond just the characters we know and love in 'A Song of Ice and Fire.'

Please accept this book for what it is, rather than complaining about what it does not aim to be. And what exactly is it? An artefact from Westeros. It should be read not as a book Martin wrote, but one he transcribed, from the original text by Archmaester Gyldayn. It will require some work on the part of the reader. The lines have been drawn, and we are being asked to fill in the colors with our imaginations. This participatory reading is what can make history so engaging—it takes work, but the work pays off.

We have two choices: We can claw after the next GoT book, complaining that the author hasn’t yet met our demands. Or we can allow the author a chance to fill out his universe. For my part, this stuff is more exciting than the series proper. We get to see the bigger picture that all of the Song of Ice and Fire is a part of. If you don't want this sort of thing, simply move on rather than ruining the experience for others.

I remember what it felt like to sit down one day as a boy and open 'The Silmarillion.' I was holding the Bible of the Elves. It was a piece of that world. It was a text that might have been read by a scholar in Minas Tirith. It was magic. Martin has the chance to give us this now. Imagine being Samwell Tarly, sitting in the Citadel's library, opening up this ponderous and magical tome about the history of the Targaryens for the first time.

Why now, though? Why not wait until he's finished telling the main story? For my part, I'd rather follow the passion of a writer than get mediocre work demanded by fans. Martin created this universe for us; let him follow his vision for how it should proceed. He was caught up in the glorious history of his universe as he was telling his story, and he wants us to have it in all of its rich complexity. I can only wish that Tolkien had had the same opportunity in his lifetime. We only see fragments of what that might have been. But Martin is giving us his own great mythology, in his own lifetime, whole and complete; and I am a boy again with wonder.

This, my friends, is going to be a feast.",positive

60,Audible Books & Originals,Unfinished Tales,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"A man who is as thorough in his revisions as Tolkien was will inevitably leave behind tales that never quite reach that state of completion. It is no surprise that there are many stories from The Silmarillion that Tolkien attempted to expand upon and never quite reached the end. After all, he was notorious for not only going through a manuscript thoroughly to revise it if there was any indication of interest in publishing it, but he also would start at the beginning of a tale every time he picked it back up to work on it. This habit led to many great beginnings to work that never quite reached that status of being complete. And thus they find life in this publication, alongside various essays on topics such as the Istari and Palantiri, and that is a great thing for fans of Tolkien and of fantasy.

The collection in here ranges from fascinating narratives to a genealogical listing of the kings written in a style that you would expect to find within a history book. There are some items that will interest certain readers more than others, and the impulse of the reader may be to skip ahead to the things of interest and leave the others unread. Which, in many cases, would be to skip over all of the First Age and most of the Second Age stuff. That, I believe, would be a tragic mistake. The best of the tales appear in those two ages, being longer narratives that, while incomplete, give a flavor of the epic nature of the characters rooted in Middle-Earth history. Fans who have read The Silmarillion will certainly enjoy getting a deeper dive into the adventures of some of these familiar figures, such as Túrin Turambar, and even a reader who has not enjoyed The Silmarillion will still find much to enjoy in some of those tales. I'd argue that they are presented in a far more compelling manner than The Silmarillion, having more development and storytelling than appears in the other work.

All in all, this is a welcome piece to any Tolkien collection and an enjoyable group of stories and essays to read about Tolkien and his work. It would also appeal to any writers of fantasy to see some of how Tolkien worked, and the depth he put into fleshing out the history of the fictional world he created. I cannot recommend this book enough and know I will be diving back into this one as often as I will be The Silmarillion.",positive
61,Audible Books & Originals,Unfinished Tales,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth  A great companion for LoTR and Tolkien fans. Although it's a book with different transcripts of Tolkien compiled and edited by his son, Christopher, it gives you a glimpse of the vast world of middle-earth that Tolkien created. I personally enjoyed the tale of Galadriel and Celeborn, which gives you more detail of this mysterious yet intriguing character and the many possibilities of his origins. The children of hurin is great here, but it is more developed in the book that treats this story alone (which i also own and enjoyed). One of my favorites is the tale of Aldarion and Erendis, one that i read in a day. The tale about how the Gandalf convinced Thorin about the journey to Bilbo's house is also a great piece.

The good thing with this book is that for people who read the hobbit, LoTR and the simalirion can use this book to connect everything under a single story line (which is what Tolkien intended in the first place) and with the appendices you can expand that even more (some say that because it's Christopher Tolkien who edited it it's not the same, but Christopher was his father's confidant in everything regarding middle-earth, and i think there is no better person than him to fill in the pieces we as Tolkien fans want to find to connect this incredible literary universe). For casual Tolkien readers maybe this is too dense and not that interesting since it's like the tittle describes ""Unfinished Tales"", which indicates that most of the stories are bits and pieces found in Tolkien's archives. But for us who want to go deeper in this universe, is a must have!",positive

Shipping was cheap considering it was to the US. Handling was surprisingly exceptional since the slipcases on the deluxe line can easily be damaged.

The rise and fall of the Eldar and the hidden city. You will hear the tragic story of Turin (this is the complete story by the way. So if you read it here, you can skip reading Children of Hurin, it is the exact same tale). You will be enchanted by the story of Beren and Luthien, and mourn with Nimrodel.

Only get into this book if you know what you are getting into. As I said, some of the stories are incomplete. The timeline is not linear... as some of the stories are not told in a historical order.

64,Audible Books & Originals,Unfinished Tales,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"Christopher Tolkien undertook an immense task when he decided to turn his father's decades of work into publishable, cohesive literature. This book is extensive in detail, with a myriad of names and places to try and remember and make sense of, and at the same time apply it to several time lines and plots one should already know from the Lord of the Rings series. This is indeed heavy reading and text-book like at times and really should only be undertook by someone who is already familiar with Middle Earth.

This book is also rewarding. Many answers are solved and some mysteries revealed. I particularly enjoyed learning about the kingdom of Numenor and the origins of the five wizards, and Gandalf's endeavors in the decades leading up to the war of the ring.

One warning I'll give to any novice Tolkien readers is that you should have already read the Silmarillion and the Lord of the Rings before attempting to read this if you really want to understand it and at the same time not spoil the other said books.

70,Audible Books & Originals,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo: A Novel,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"“I spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much I loved her.”

This is one of the best books I’ve ever had the privilege to read. It is probably in the top five for best books I’ve ever read in my entire life. I have been looking for a book like this my entire life, and no combination of words I’m about to type, and you’re about to read, is going to do this masterpiece justice. But I will say that Gabby, Joce, Amelie, and Elyse were all right, and I’m so happy I listened to them, because this book is worth every single ounce of hype.

And when I say that this book is lifechanging, I truly mean it. This book is sold as a historical romance, where you learn about a fictional, famous, old Hollywood actress and all her marriages. What you get is a book that stars a bisexual, Cuban woman who was never allowed to talk about the love of her life; her wife. And when I say I cried during this book, I truly mean that I probably need to buy a new copy because I was the biggest mess you’ve ever seen.

“And it will be the tragedy of my life that I cannot love you enough to make you mine. That you cannot be loved enough to be anyone’s.”

On top of this being a powerful book about race, sexuality, misogyny, and having to conform to societies norms, the true meaning I took from this book is that life is short, so damn short, and we shouldn’t spend it pretending to be something we aren’t. And we shouldn’t spend it doing anything less than loving the people who are worthy and deserving of our love.

“I didn’t need boys in order to feel good. And that realization gave me great power.”

We follow Evelyn from the very start; losing her mother very young, her body developing very quickly, noticing others noticing her developing body, marrying a man so she can leave the dead-end city she grew up in, so she can become something more. Evelyn is unapologetic with her actions, and it is one of the most empowering things I’ve ever read. She plays so many more parts than the roles she is cast in. And Evelyn learns really quickly how to play each and every man she is forced to interact with, and she quickly learns what she can gain from each and every one of them, too.

This story is told from two different timelines and two different points of view. One from Monique Grant, who is a biracial (white and African-American) woman who is going through a fresh divorce and trying to make something of herself in the journalism field. And her life changes the day her editor tells her how Evelyn Hugo is demanding her, and only her, to write something for her.

“Heartbreak is loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.”

The other timeline(s) are all the different times in Evelyn’s life, and the different seven husbands that she had, while she is recounting the events that lead her to be telling Monique this story. Evelyn has lived a very full life, and is in her late seventies now, and is finally ready to talk about her life. But the entire book we are guessing why she has chosen only Monique for this job.

“Make them pay you what they would pay a white man.”

If you guys have been following my reviews, you’ll probably know that I talk about found family and how important it is to me a lot, but The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is the epitome of how beautiful a found family can be. Evelyn and Harry’s friendship in this was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever read in my entire reading life.

“When you write the ending, Monique, make sure the reader understands that all I was ever really looking for was family. Make sure it’s clear that I found it. Make sure they know that I am heartbroken without it.”

And the romance? The true romance in this book is the most romantic thing I have ever read in my entire life. And you guys know I’ve read a ton of romances, but they are all lesser to this. Every single one of them can’t compare with the romance in this book. I feel like every time I’ve used the word “perfect” to describe something that wasn’t the romance in this book, then I used the word wrong.

“Please never forget that the sun rises and sets with your smile. At least to me it does. You’re the only thing on this planet worth worshipping.”

How many Evelyn and Celias are there in the world? How many are still playing the role that Evelyn was forced to play? I cry for every single person who must hide who they are, and who they want to love. And this book talks about many big things in LGBTQIAP+ history; from the Stonewall riots to the disgusting Reagan administration, but life still isn't anywhere close to equal in 2018. The prejudices, the discrimination, the virus/syndrome blaming, the looks I’ve experienced holding a girl’s hand while walking into a restaurant? Those are still in 2018, in the United States, but people act like none of those things exists because marriage is legalized, begrudgingly. I’m not writing this review to get on my soapbox, but I promise, we have a lot more work to do. And this book, this book lit a fire under me.

I personally identify as pansexual, but I felt like the bisexual rep in this was a tier above anything my eyes have ever seen. Seeing Evelyn love all the parts of her, and all the different parts of her love, was something so awe-inspiring. I am still so overwhelmed with feelings, but if you identify as bi or pan, this is a love letter to you, I promise.

“I was a lesbian when she loved me and a straight woman when she hated me.”

This book also focuses a huge importance on motherhood throughout the entirety of this book, and then I read the acknowledgement and started weeping all over again. Taylor Jenkins Reid was able to evoke the strongest emotions from me, and I just pray that things will be different for the generation of kids being raised right now.

This was the first thing I’ve read by Taylor Jenkins Reid, but I will buy every single new thing she produces. The writing was so lyrical and addicting. I mean, I have a quote between almost every paragraph. This whole book deserves to be highlighted. The characters, well, my mind has now forever imagined that these are real people now, so there is that. The topics, themes, and discussions are beyond important. This book just makes me feel so passionately. This book is one of the most empowering pieces of literature I’ve ever consumed. And I am not the same person I was before this book.

“I told her every single day that her life had been the world’s greatest gift to me, that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.”

If you guys ever take a recommendation from me; please have it be The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Please, I’m actually begging you. I promise, this book is lifechanging, and I equally promise you that this book changed mine. There is magic between these four-hundred-pages. Pure magic. This story is addicting, enthralling, and so important. And if you’re an Evelyn, in 2018, I see you, but I hope it doesn’t take you as long as it took her to be happy. This will forever be one of the best books of my life, and I’ll cherish it forever.

71,Audible Books & Originals,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo: A Novel,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Starting at the young age of fourteen and ending when she’s seventy-nine (when we first meet Evelyn), Evelyn Hugo has gone from bombshell, to sexpot, to Oscar winner, to civil rights supporter. Evelyn knew what she wanted from an early age—to get out of Hell’s Kitchen and away from her abusive father, and to be the biggest star anyone has ever heard of. And she accomplished that! Partially because of her talent, partially because she knows her worth and is unafraid to get dirty in order to achieve her goals, and partially because there is no one better at using the press and scandals to serve their own interests. Evelyn is both a force to be reckoned with, but also a deeply flawed and lonely. Shown through the perspective of Evelyn as she dictates her memoir to Monique, the reader is taken back to the early days of Hollywood to watch Evelyn’s rise, and her stumbles, to and through stardom. For a story about a Hollywood starlet, this book is LAYERED, and I don’t think I was expecting the level of depth it had, even though many reviews warned me to expect the unexpected with this story.

In order to become Evelyn Hugo, Hollywood’s biggest star, Evelyn had to let go of who she was; erasing her identity to be what Hollywood wanted her to be. She knew and accepted this, always, but it does break your heart a little to watch her identity get stripped away so that she could be the blonde bombshell the screen so loved. The things Evelyn hid or changed, often denying the realest parts of herself in the process, really hit me in the feels, and there were parts at the end of the book that had me welling up with tears if that tells you anything. I won’t say more because the way the story unfolds is really lovely with getting to know all 7 of Evelyn’s husbands and the roles they played in her life, but I will say that I LOVED the inclusion of the fake articles to show the juxtaposition between what was Evelyn’s reality versus what the public got to see, and how the press portrayed her in return.

Honestly, there was very little I did not like about this book, or its story. It flowed beautifully and, while not necessarily one of those books you couldn’t put down (I had no issues stopping in reading for the night) it was never dull. It had a smooth, and highly enjoyable writing style. However, my only issues were that sometimes, with the book being told in 1st person, Monique didn’t always feel that distinct to me from Evelyn. Which may be mostly because we don’t really get to know Monique at the same level at which we get to know Evelyn, though I did enjoy their relationship and how they were able to help each other, even when that got . . . tricky, to say the least. But I also didn’t like Celia for a majority of the book, either. I found her to be so frustrating at times, that I often wondered why Evelyn even bothered having her around. Thankfully that changed toward the end, but still.

But, all in all, I LOVED this book and this story. It was so empowering, watching Evelyn be so unashamed to own her beauty, her sex appeal, her confidence, and to be the ball-buster she was, so unafraid of telling people what she wants, what she deserves—all because she knows her worth. I didn’t know how much I needed a story, to see a woman like that, until I read this book. But I also loved that the author didn’t shy away from Evelyn’s flaws, or the fact that, for a lot of Evelyn’s life, she was deeply lonely. Evelyn wasn’t perfect, but she didn’t let that be an excuse for anyone to treat her poorly. I will say there are some instances of spousal abuse in this book though, so just be forewarned if that kind of trauma is sensitive for you. I thought the author handled those topics amazingly well, but I’ve also never experienced such things for myself, either. Because this book brought tears to my eyes with that whole last third of the story, it easily gets 5 stars from me! This is such a satisfying, and empowering book!",positive
72,Audible Books & Originals,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo: A Novel,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"“Evelyn always leaves you hoping you’ll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.”

In a stunning novel about love, hate, and perception, Taylor Jenkins Reid mesmerized me from the start. In a compelling tale about what you would do for true love, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo may be my new go-to book to recommend to fellow book lovers.

After being recommended this book to me numerous times, even with a huge TBR pile, I knew I had to get it finally and immediately read it – and everyone was correct! There is just something about Reid’s writing that pulls you in to the untouchable Hollywood movie glamour, describing the movie lots, gorgeous dresses, and the behind-the-scenes politics that goes into getting the roles of a lifetime.

Evelyn Hugo is one of the most famous actresses in the world but has been a recluse for years after being widowed by her seventh husband. Finally ready to tell her full story, she reaches out to Monique Grant – a magazine reporter – to divulge what the public and media has always desperately wanted to know. But why pick Monique?

I was raptured by Evelyn’s life; told in segments paralleled by the man she was currently married to. Her character is brave, unscrupulous, and unapologetic about what she has had to do to have a successful career. We quickly learn that life isn’t all about what is being spoon-fed to the media and that famous people are not afforded any privacy at the chance of selling a story: “The media are going to tell whatever story they want to tell.”

I was just as invested in Monique’s story as well, which Reid carefully intertwines while not distracting from Evelyn’s tale. And Celia and Harry’s characters add to the Hollywood Era and make their way into your heart as well. But Evelyn doesn’t let us forget that: “You’re not really famous if anybody still likes you.”

I truthfully had no idea what to expect when picking up this novel, but it was not this – this book left you wanting more while still feeling somehow like you lived it. We learn that both love and “hate is not uncomplicated” and not everything is how it meets the eye. Heavy topics were discussed with a certain beauty and ease that made you feel every emotion. This novel is simply put, a masterpiece! 5 stars!

73,Audible Books & Originals,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo: A Novel,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"This book took me three attempts to read; finally, I was ready at the fourth attempt. Although, I didn’t find the beginning captivating, I’m the type of reader that must complete a book once started. It’s because I don’t want to wonder if something occurred in the story that became exciting.

In the case of this story, I’m so glad I stuck with it. I don’t want to give away any major spoilers, so I feel it’s safe to express the following: The story starts off during the 50s era. I didn’t find the stories regarding each of Evelyn’s husbands very interesting but I understood the reason for them. Being a movie icon, as Evelyn became, the big screen life wasn’t an easy one to venture through for women. During that era and decades after, women were looked upon for their beautiful face and/or voluptuous body. If talent was involved, that was a bonus for the directors/producers. Needless to say, Evelyn did what it took to become a legend.

I was really captivated by the friendship and love shared between Evelyn and Henry. I loved how genuine and heartfelt it was. The same goes for Evelyn and Celia. These two relationships is what kept me reading and rooting for their success in every area and torn when events weren’t going well.

The main character (besides Evelyn) was Monique who ends up being the chosen one by Evelyn, to write and publish her life story. In taking down Evelyn’s life events, there ends up being a surprise that I didn’t see coming. Any surprise thrown in a story that isn’t expected is awesome writing in my book.

As with age, comes death or death comes too soon. There was plenty of death and it painfully pulled at my heartstrings. Overall, the story was well put together and I did end up enjoying it.",positive

I may well be incorrect in that assessment but what was contained in this work was a representation of the social morality at that time period.
I found the writing to be insightful as to how a woman had to use what physical traits seen as outstanding in different ways to get her foot in the door to have a chance at becoming famous.
Sexuality isn't something you can easily quantify. Slapping labels on others is short sighted and we love whoever we love often to our own surprise. I've seen wonderful marriages which were that way because they were kindred spirits.
I really enjoyed reading this book because it was honest to the relationships it portrayed and the self examination people go through in an attempt to justify their decisions.
Readers, please remember this was written about a specific time period and don't judge it by how things are today, it was a different, more judgmental, and harsher time when it came to who you could or should love.",positive

After reading this book, I immediately went online to find out what others said, I was surprised by the amount of negative reviews. This is more than a “book tok”/ trendy book. It has relatable characters, thought invoking themes and beautiful writing; there are so many quotes that made my heart ache.

76,Audible Books & Originals,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo: A Novel,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Let me start by saying that this is the second book I’ve read by TJR, the first being Daisy Jones & The Six. I didn’t know much about Daisy and the same can be said for Evelyn. It’s true. I’ve managed to avoid all spoilers for a book that’s five years old. And boy am I glad I did! The last 100 pages or so had me in tears. I know most of you have read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by this point, but in the event you haven’t I don’t want to spoil anything for you.

TSHOEH is one big dichotomy of many different traits and emotions: good/bad; love/hate; love/loss; success/failure; heartwarming/heartbreaking; ego/humility; forgiveness/retribution; used/user; truth/lies. It’s all of these things and more. In a nutshell, the book is exactly what the title implies, but it’s so much more. It’s a love story, but probably not the one you’re expecting. It also has a little bit of mystery one that’s seeded throughout. I loved every word of TSHOEH and from here on out TJR will be an auto-buy for me!

Evelyn Hugo, the book and the person are captivating and you want to know more and we have Taylor Jenkins Reid to thank for it. Reid is a masterful storyteller who makes you believe all of these characters are real people. And they are in a sense. Her characters may be famous, but they all suffer from the same issues and problems we all do. Sure she writes about fictional characters based on an amalgamation of real people, but she does it with such care and detail that it has you heading to the Goog, just to check and be sure that you are in fact reading fiction.

Why does it work? To quote the fictionally famous Penny Lane “Famous people are just more interesting.” I highly recommend this book, I read it in a day and a half.

Even though this is a work of fiction, it pulls back the curtain of Hollywood, old Hollywood specifically. However, I suspect a lot of these behind the scenes power play machinations still happen regularly, even in 2022 and I find that to be very, very sad.",positive

Overall,

So general fiction is not my usual preference for genre of books, I tend to lean more towards fantasy, science fiction and romance. I just like the added seasoning to my reading. With that said I really did enjoy this book. After hearing about it all over booktok and other platforms I decided that I may as well step out of my own comfort zone and give it a try. I am very glad I did. This book was a mix between loving and hating the main character. Evelyn is very aware of what kind of woman she is, and she was willing to do anything to get what she wanted. Including getting married 7 times. The true beauty of this book is her true relationships that she had with Harry and Ceilia. They were the ones who knew her best and understood her down to her core being. Everyone else only saw who Evelyn wanted them to see. The LGBTQ+ representation in its historical context is also really interesting.

Cover,

The cover is beautiful and as alluring as Evelyn Hugo herself. It draws you in to at the very least ask, what kind of book is this?

Recommendation,

This is an adult book with adult themes and I would recommend this to almost anyone. The story is engaging and the characters are fascinating. This should be on everyone’s TBR.",positive

The story is glamorous, but also gripping and sad too. It was interesting to learn about Evelyn and her early life. It was also a bit sad to see that she didn't have any confidence in herself. I was definitely interested in all the details of her life. I really didn't love Cecilia all that much and found her to be unforgiving. I did enjoy the relationship Evelyn and Harry had though. It was pure and just right. I was a little annoyed that Evelyn wasn't a super hands on mom until later. That was almost unforgivable as a mother myself, but she redeemed herself in that area for me. It was truly heartbreaking the way it happened though. Monique is the character I'm having a hard time deciding on. There are parts of her I like and others I don't enjoy. I saw her growth through the story, but was also frustrated at her at times.

82,Audible Books & Originals,"The Fellowship of the Ring: Lord of the Rings, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"The tale grew in the telling, as Tolkien put it. The Lord of the Rings began as a sequel to Tolkien's successful children's book, The Hobbit. The early drafts of the story were written in the same lighthearted manner as the Hobbit in a style quite different from the stories of the Elves, posthumously published as the Silmarilion, that Tolkien considered his real life's work. Very soon, however, the tale took on a darker and grander tone. Tolkien's two worlds that briefly touched in the Hobbit, came together to produce the epic tale of the War of the Ring and the end of the Elder Days of the Eldar.

The Hobbit is a children's book that adults can enjoy. The Lord of the Rings is the book for those children who enjoyed the Hobbit who are now grown up. The Elves no longer sit in trees and sing silly songs. They are the Firstborn, ancient beings of great ability and nobility who have their own sorrows. The Dwarves become the noble Khazad, the Naugrim with a fierce loyalty to kin and friends and ever willing to fight for their rights. Gandalf grows from being a cantankerous conjurer to a mighty enemy of Sauron. Bilbo's ring of invisibility, which he used to avoid unpleasant callers, becomes the One Ring, whose wearer can obtain absolute power, at the cost of his soul. The Hobbits also grow in the course of the story. Bilbo Baggins began as little more than baggage at the beginning of The Hobbit., but emerged as a great hero by the end. Frodo and company are less helpless in the beginning of the Fellowship of the Ring, but they still need rescuing. The Hobbits are decidedly minor members of the Company of the Ring, at least until the end of the first book. . By the end of the story, they have grown great enough to stand with the wizards and warriors, yet their humbler perspective continues to be essential in bringing the story to the level of the reader. The Lord of the Rings told from the viewpoint of Gandalf or Aragorn would be a different, and more remote story.

Tolkien always disavowed any connection between the events in the Lord of the Rings and the real life events that occurred during its writing. I am not sure that I believe him. Tolkien did not consciously model the War of the Ring on World War II and Sauron was not based on Hitler, but I cannot imagine that a writer's life experiences wouldn't have great influence on his writings. In Tolkien's case, there seem to be certain themes in the Lord of the Rings that must have been based on Tolkien's own experiences in in both World Wars.

One theme repeated several times in the Fellowship is that it is the small and humble who do the real work of saving the world while the great have their minds on other things. While the elves, wizards and warriors fight desperately to save Middle Earth, it is the insignificant Hobbits whose acts of heroism save the day. The Hobbits do not want to be kings or win glory in battle. They do not really want to be the ones to save the world. All the Hobbits want to do is their part for Middle Earth and then go back to the Shire. As Sam might put it, they have a job to do. Surely, Tolkien based his Hobbits on the common British enlisted men who served under him in World War I. The generals and statesmen made great plans for reordering the world, but it was the courage of the ordinary soldiers who won the war.

There is also a deep sense of loss that pervades the Lord of the Rings. This is not so apparent in the Fellowship of the Ring, except in the chapters dealing with the elves, especially in Lothlorien. This feeling of loss, that much that is good in Middle Earth must pass away even if Sauron is defeated becomes especially poignant in The Return of the King so perhaps I should discuss it more in a review of that part of the trilogy. This feeling of loss, even in victory, must come from Tolkien's own experiences. In both world wars, Britain was victorious over German aggression, the good guys won, but after both wars Britain and the world was forever changed. In some ways, this change was for the better, yet much that was good about the prewar world was gone forever. By the time the Lord of the Rings was published in the 1950's, Tolkien might well have felt like one of his Eldar, living in a world that was no longer his.

The Fellowship of the Ring, then, is more than simply a fantasy, but a serious, though fun, story dealing with serious themes of plot and characterization. I am convinced that the Lord of the Rings will be one of the few books from the twentieth century still read centuries from now.",positive

94,Audible Books & Originals,Antoinette's Sister,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Antoinette’s Sister by Diana Giovinazzo
Antoinette’s Sister is a new book by Diana Giovinazzo. For those of you who have been to Naples and especially have visited the Royal Palace in Caserta, you will love all the background this book gives. Equally, if you have an interest in old Italy under the Bourbon rule when the south was known as The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, you will enjoy a sweeping coverage of this explosive era.
Our story begins in Vienna at Schonbrunn Palace, the seat of the Royal Hapsburgs. It is the 1700’s and Empress Marie Terese is very busy arranging the marriages of her sixteen children to various powerhouses throughout Europe in order to strengthen and maintain the Hapsburg influence. Basically, this was the modus operendi of the royal families throughout history. Queen Victoria certainly participated in the chess game of royal blood lines. Because of deaths due to smallpox in Schonbrunn, Marie Carolina Charlotte, who had originally been destined to be Queen of France, instead becomes the wife of King Ferdinando, the very reluctant, spoiled, childish, undisciplined heir to the Kingdome of the Two Sicilies, Naples down to and including the island.
Marie Antoinette, her most beloved sister and dearest friend, as we all know, went to the ill-fated King Louis of France. The novel runs on two equal themes. One is the development of Queen Charlotte from her youth as a 15-year-old bride to a remarkable and admirable queen. She overcomes numerous obstacles and is able to do so because of her strict, no-nonsense, well-educated upbringing. She was groomed to rule. Her husband is basically, and true to history, a buffoon whose only purpose is to impregnate Queen Charlotte (15 times), and then leave her to govern while he played his games.
The second parallel theme is the relationship of Queen Marie Carolina Charlotte and Queen Marie Antoinette. We see them develop from childhood almost like twins. Many chapters include a letter from Queen Marie Antoinette to Queen Charlotte. The letters are fiction because Queen Charlotte destroyed all correspondence with her sisters and brothers before her death. The letters are important to the text because they are a masterful way of revealing the dramatic world situation swirling around the royal houses. America has broken with England with the help of France; but now the idea of democracy takes a foothold in France and thus the French Revolution, the Reign of Terror, the guillotining of King Louis and Queen Marie Antoinette and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon, of course, is eyeing Italy.
Throughout the novel you will meet many colorful historical characters who influenced Queen Charlotte and Naples, and the building of the magnificent royal palace of Caserta. Put that place on your bucket list!",positive

Then you and your husband come to an understanding, you kind of like him now, he is letting you rule AND keep your boyfriend in the kingdom. Your sister in France is locked up and will soon be beheaded. Yes, the courts of the late 1700s were just wild with a little bit of everything.

I liked all the history and getting to see a character’s whole life. The author does a great job of taking history and making it come to life. While I don’t normally care for much politics in the books I read, the author always has a great balance and keeps me interested even in the politics.

This time of history is fascinating to me and it was fun to watch it come to life.

With following the whole life, the connection was hard to make with the characters and really getting to know them deep. They were just characters on the page instead of in my head coming to life.

97,Audible Books & Originals,Antoinette's Sister,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Antoinette’s Sister is an alluring, compelling tale set in Europe during the late 1700s that tells the story of Maria Carolina Charlotte, a young, Habsburg archduchess who not only became the powerful Queen of Naples and Sicily and a loving mother after her reluctant marriage to the immature King Ferdinand IV but also remained a stalwart, unwavering supporter of her closest and dearest sister, Marie Antoinette, Queen of France.

The prose is seamless and vivid. The characters are intelligent, ruthless, and bold. And the plot is an insightful, sweeping tale of the struggles, sacrifices, hopes, fears, entangled relationships, love affairs, schemes, and treachery that surrounded one of the most powerful families of the time.

Antoinette’s Sister is, ultimately, a story about life, loss, politics, power, family, desires, sacrifices, love, and war.

98,Audible Books & Originals,Antoinette's Sister,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"As a lover of historical fiction, I thought this was a really great read. The novel transports you to the eighteenth century and gives you a seat at the tables of the Kings and Queens of Austria, Naples and France. The Empress of the Holy Roman Empire, Maria Theresa of Austria, manipulates the betrothals of her children in order to gain greater power, throughout all of Europe, for the Hapsburg dynasty. However, the main character in this story is Maria Carolina Charlotte who is the tenth daughter of the Empress and sister to Marie Antoinette. When Charlotte is forced to marry King Ferdinand IV of Naples she begins to exert her own power over their kingdom, while at the same time she is helpless to save her sister from her fateful destiny in France.

The lives and loves of these strong women spill onto the pages and immerse the reader into a different time and place. The letters between many of the characters, at the end of each chapter, were a great conduit to outlining the story. I would highly recommend this book to fans of Philippa Gregory or Michelle Moran or to readers who enjoy anything royal or who are looking for an escape.",positive
99,Audible Books & Originals,Antoinette's Sister,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Wow! This book is SO GOOD! It is powerful, moving, emotional, thought-provoking, gripping, and so much more! Whenever I picked up ""Antoinette's Sister"", I was whisked back in time to the 1700s and early 1800s, and went on such an emotional journey with this story.

This is the first book I have read by Diana Giovinazzo, and it will certainly not be my last! Her writing style is visceral, vivid, detailed, and incredibly well-researched. I can only imagine the amount of time she spend researching this book, as each aspect: from the story being told, to the historical figures brought to life, to the various locations, etc. jumped right off of the page before my eyes. They all also felt so authentic to the time period the book is set in. I could really envision everything, and often forgot I was reading a book as I was so swept away into the story.

This book tells the story of Maria Carolina Charlotte, who becomes Queen of Naples and Sicilty. We first meet Charlotte as a young girl, who absolutely adores her sister Antoinette. The two have a very close relationship and spend all of their time together, until their mother separates them thinking they are bad influences on one another. Charlotte and Antoinette promise they will never allow themselves to be separated, and that they will find a way to communicate.

When their sister Josepha dies, Charlotte is chosen to marry King Ferdinand IV of Naples, and her life is changed forever as she is sent away to be queen. I do not want to spoil too much of this book plot wise, but, I will say, this book is a must-read. So much history is in this book, and everything weaves together in a story that is difficult to put down.

I found the concept the letters being written throughout very interesting, and think the author did a wonderful job of tying them in to what the chapter is about in many ways. I found this very unique and intriguing!

If you enjoy historical fiction novels, I highly recommend this book! It kept me turning the pages to see what would happen chapter after chapter, and I so look forward to reading what Ms. Giovinazzo writes next! I also look forward to doing more research of Maria Carolina Charlotte, and her life and times too.

Thank you so much to Grand Central Publishing and NetGalley for the ARC of this book, and to Grand Central Publishing for sending me a beautiful finished copy as well, it is incredible! All opinions expressed in this review are my own.",positive
100,Audible Books & Originals,"The Two Towers: Lord of the Rings, Book 2",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"(Warning: Plenty of spoilers ahead)

Another classic tackled. After reading The Fellowship of the Ring, I didn’t think I’d stick with this series despite its indelible mark on the fantasy genre and literature in general. I found The Fellowship unnecessarily long, slow-moving, and incredibly hard to get through. At the end of each chapter, I felt frustrated with how little had happened.

But then, days and weeks after I finished, I kept thinking about the characters and their journey. I stand by my initial critiques — too much world-building (see: way too many names of things and people) + poor pacing (see: the first three chapters — the movie does this better) — but I was still curious about the goings-on of Middle-earth and could begrudgingly admit the journey is the destination, or however that quote goes.

So I ordered The Two Towers, thinking I’d probably do better with a physical copy over an ebook. I can confirm this was the right move. I can also confirm the second book moves along much more quickly than the first with plenty of exciting plot points. That said, I drastically preferred the first half (Book Three) over the second (Book Four). Book Three picks up with the fellowship companions that Frodo and Sam abandoned at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring while Book Four again resumes the journey with Frodo and Sam.

What I’ve come to realize is that I don’t like Frodo. Fair warning, many spoilers ahead.

Hear me out! Literally everyone else is so much more interesting (yeah, yeah, that’s probably the point or something). I know Gandalf is always saying Aragorn is the best tracker ever, but this book really proves it. Aragorn’s like, “See that single broken blade of grass in a huge trampled field? Yeah, the Orcs went that way and they carried two hobbits.” I mean, this guy could actually find a needle in a haystack. And he’s a talented composer of songs and poems alike?! Is there anything he can’t do???

Meanwhile, Legolas and Gimli SHINE. Legolas already served as my primary source of comedic relief with his prancing all over snow mounds and confusion with the slow progress of his group. The bromance between the Elf and Dwarf takes flight, culminating in the battle at Helm’s Deep, where every time they find each other again, they compare kill counts (a little dark, sure) and support one another like no one’s business. And anytime another character’s prejudice keeps them from inviting Gimli to their homes, Legolas is like, “Oh, nuh-uh. I’m not coming without my brave FRIEND, Gimli, for whom I would DIE.” I live for it.

Plus, y’know, Gandalf is resurrected (or never died?) so that’s kind of a big deal. Although he’s still hoarding secrets and off doing who-knows-what most of the time, hand-waving his aliveness away with vague explanations. How can an author be so verbose when describing every hill, hole, and river in any five-mile radius and yet leave the twist of a Wizard’s non-death to the imagination?

So yeah, Book Three — I’m here for it. This is the story I want to read. It’s most interesting when all the different characters are playing off each other. Then we get to Book Four, which has drastically fewer characters and, for the most part, straight traveling. It reminds me of my least favorite parts of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Honestly, traveling isn’t actually so bad, but we got so much of it in Books One and Two.

Let’s get to the root of my problems. First, I tend to get lost in Tolkien’s long descriptions. Second, I’m so tired of being told that Frodo is kind and pure and perfect. He acts fairly entitled and superior with Sam — who admittedly leans into the servant role — content to boss Sam around, criticize him (see: knot-tying), and never truly listen to his suggestions or concerns. Oddly, Frodo seems to have way more empathy for Smeagol than he does for long-time friend Sam, probably because he wants to look good to Gandalf. Meanwhile, Sam is literally out here sacrificing his life for Frodo but whatevs.

The last two chapters in particular drag. The fight scene with the spider feels drawn out, Frodo’s capture even more so. Why do we have to sit through so much unimportant Orc dialogue just to learn Frodo lives but they’re going to lock him up? I’m ranting now.

I wish Books Three and Four had been combined and the chapters alternated between both groups of characters — that would’ve kept the story moving. And I wish there were more (read: any) prominent female characters. Tolkien can introduce beings and societies like the Ents, but not strong female characters? We even get a quasi-explanation for the lack of female Ents and, y’all, buckle in. The Entwives and Entmaidens are missing. The men left them alone for a bit and now they’re gone. Just gone. Please tell me we pick this thread back up in the next book because what?!

Like, this is an extensive fantasy world and we can have entirely male populations (see: Orcs), but not any entirely non-male groups? I mean, Eowyn is introduced and she even gets to hold a position of power, but she’s there and gone again in the blink of an eye. Fingers-crossed we see her again. I’ll even take Galadriel again in all her beauty = perfection glory.

Sorry, look at me, ranting again. I did actually like this book, I swear! The prose is lyrical and timeless. The included poems and songs hit all the right notes. Boromir’s farewell is heart wrenching, affecting each of the characters in different yet profound ways. And we get to meet Faramir, who I found to be an absolute baller — decisive and intimidating, yet genuine and kind. Standout moments are meeting the Ents, the battle at Helm’s Deep, and Sam’s fumble in the end zone with Faramir. Oh also Smeagol is surprisingly sympathetic? Like I get where Frodo is coming from, but c’mon, just please also send a little of that understanding Sam’s way. He’s way less annoying than Pippin, at the very least!

So if like me, you finished the first book in the series and aren’t sure if you want to keep going, I’d recommend sticking with it! This is a series that only keeps getting better.",positive

I’m beyond thrilled to have finished Two Towers. My uncle said it was his least favorite, but I think it gives so much to the readers. Faramir for example is a character that I wasn’t overly impressed by in the movies. Or maybe I should say he didn’t make a big impression. I felt bad for him of course. But the book gives you not only so much more insight to his character, but the kingdom of Gondor and the men that hail from there. You just gain so much more, although my reading time was long on this, it really was a page turner. To me it was one of those books I’m so torn. I want to speed read through it. But then I also don’t want it to end.",positive

109,Audible Books & Originals,"The Two Towers: Lord of the Rings, Book 2",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"I read The Hobbit first. I loved it, but the more I reflect on it, its become one of my favorite books ever written. Fellowship was next, and it had its moments that I liked such as the party at Bag End, or the meeting with the Nazghul, but overall it was so boring that I would give it a 2.5 if half stars were allowed but since I'm nice and loved The Hobbit so much I rounded it up to 3. The Two Towers though?? Before I started I was always the most scared of this book; Fellowship is about the history of the Ring and planning to destroy it, Return of the King is about actually destroying it. What is so important in the middle to deserve its own tome of a story as well as its own 3 hour movie? I thought this would've been the most boring. But actually, no. It was slow yes, and maybe it only flew by because I listen to the audio at 2x speed, but this one flew by. Slow, but not BORING if you catch my drift. Really my biggest complaint is the structure, which I kind of understand: the first half is everything with Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Sarumon, King Theorin and Eomir (I believe were their names), The Battle of Helms Deep, etc, we never get Frodo and Sam and Gollum until the second half and then that half is ALL Frodo, Sam, and Gollum. I get it, it does make sense to do it that way but I feel like it could've been more exciting to cut back and forth throughout (which I'm assuming the film does, I haven't actually seen the films yet). I still don't think this is as good as The Hobbit but my lord, this is leaps and bounds better than Fellowship in my opinion.

120,Audible Books & Originals,"The Return of the King: Lord of the Rings, Book 3",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Two points to clarify about the most popular single-volume LOTR editions:

1) The 1991 single-volume Alan Lee-illustrated edition is the ""centenary"" edition, commemorating Tolkien's 100th birthday (cf. ""centenarian"") . The ""centennial"" edition won't be published until 2054, which will be the 100th anniversary of the original publication of Lord of the Rings. This is a very well designed and well printed/bound edition, built to last and beatufil. Its only fault is the absence of fold-out maps (it has the black and white maps printed in sections, often seen in paperback editions).

2) The reason for the broken type in the 1974 red leatherette ""Collector's Edition"" (and the occurrences of this number on the order of 1 or 2 characters on every 50th page or so) is more likely that the source text from which the negatives/plates were made and this edition printed was itself flawed and originally was some form of letterpress metal type, probably Monotype [a more 'modern' version of the old LinoType system], though depending on the date of that setting [up to mid-'60s, or even later] it may have been hand-composed. All metal type gets re-used, and becomes worn and some of it cracked/chipped over time. There were many books reprinted in this way through the early '80s (and a few publishers, such as Lindsay Books, of long out-of-print, mostly public-domain or 'gray rights' titles, still do this).

The problem is unlikely to have been caused by faults in photo-typesetting strips or process-camera negs in 1973 or so (when this LOTR Collector's Edition was first printed) since that process was a fully mature, climax technology by then, and quality control was simply outstanding (this was due to that extinct beast, the unionized master-printer, especially at Houghton Mifflin, a publisher with a very large academic textbook list, and an industry reputation for quality production; just look at any ten trade hardbacks circa 1973 and earlier, and compare any element of quality to any ten current titles and it's clear the the technology and practice of printing and book binding peaked long ago, and nothing of newer technology, especially computer technology has served the interest of producing better made books, quite the opposite. 2007 tech only makes it faster and cheaper, nothing else.

Remember also that it was the Allen & Unwin type-compositors who introduced virtually all the spelling and diction errors in both the 1st and 2nd editions, some of which have only finally been fixed in the 2004-05 50th Anniversary edition; and these were errors mostly such as 'dwarves' being ""corrected"" to 'dwarfs', 'elven' to 'elfin', and many others, primarily linguistic, along those lines; these would have been proper corrections with any author other than Tolkien, of course.)

As for the notion that photo-reproduction is at all like printing a Word document on a laser printer, then scanning it back into a computer as a JPEG or GIF image file, and finally printing it again, that is a facile and plainly inaccurate comparison. In short, unless one starts with a bitmap or similar low quality computer 'font', prints on low-brightness (<70) recycled paper via a cheap ink-jet printer, scans using a 75-by-75 dpi setting via low-end scanning hardware and software, and repeats printing as above, the result will certainly be nothing so poor as Jeff Sun describes in his review. Photo-reproduction via PC and peripherals or via process-camera, strips, and offset printing, can easily and does commonly achieve excellent results, provided the equipment is of first quality and the operator is skilled.

If anyone is obsessed enough to try this (as I clearly am), one fairly reliable way to tell whether a book is printed (at some stage) from some form of metal type is to use at least a 20x loupe and examine the vertical straight edges (particularly of upper N's, T's, L's, and E's) for irregularity. Metal type degrades in miniscule degrees after the first few hundred impressions, and will show this by cracking/splitting/chipping/warbling/bending and otherwise appearing NOT straight, sharp, and crisp (especially machine-set monotype/linotype which was all lead/tin, since it was melted down repeatedly; hand-set type has antimony and sometimes manganese in it, which makes it much harder to start and also casts more sharply; parts of letters break off but usually don't deform). It's a challenge to tell these apart, since photo-reproduction of letterpress can be hard to distinguish from original letterpress printing, if the latter is done by a highly skilled compositor and press operator. Some letterpress books show the impression of the type on the page, like a light embossing, from the force of the type striking the stock. Really good printing avoids this. So, if you have a book without this feature that does show feathering, breaks, waviness, etc. it may be either letterpress or photo-repro of LP, but if these traits are present it is almost certain metal type was used at some point in the life of the typesetting.

Two caveats to even to this: feathering alone does not definitely mean deformed metal type. Feathering,, or little veins and stream-like projects away from the character is often caused by excessive inking and watery ink, and also by cheap papers that are unsized (meaning a starch like substance is added during the paper's manufacture to prevent feathering and bleedthrough; newsprint is unsized and you can see how feathering works buy lightly touching a fountain pen to a piece of it for a minute or so). The other caveat is that some computer fonts, especially some high end ones for MAC typesetting systems, have been photographically captured/reproduced from books printed mostly before 1800, and their designers often deliberately retain some of the source type's imperfections (which are due mostly to the more primitive metallurgy of that era) to achieve a particular design effect. You might be surprised how much theory and psychology underlies type-design and typography; there is a lot. Need a dissertation topic?

This has become, I see now, a rant, and a really long one. First as a reader, then as a writer, then as apprentice in a letterpress print shop and bindery, I've always held the book as art-object or craft-work in very nearly as high esteem as the words contained within. I do think these issues are worth some ink, and I expect (or hope) that those interested in fine editions such as this so-called ""Collector's "" (Ugh! I so hate that term, it's like ""deluxe"" or ""premier"" and is mildly patronizing to the reader/buyer) edition of LOTR might also find at least some of the above ramble of interest and use. I do regard this red leatherette slipcased edition (ISBN 0-39-519395-8) as my favorite. It was this edition in which I first read LOTR, and though the Centenary hardcover and the HC 50th Anniversary editions (slipcased US and UK, different designs, both excellent) are on the whole and in most particulars better printed and bound, this edition is a nostalgia item for me. I also very much like the red binding, evocative as it is of the ""Red Book of Westmarch,"" the foil-stamping on the spine, of the White Tree of Gondor, (which must be by either Pauline Baynes or by Tolkien himself) is a delight, and the two color printing, in spite of the ocassional bad character and slightly inconsistent inking, makes me feel like I'm reading an incunabulum. All of these speak across from the old world, though perhaps very long after the Third Age had concluded. I recommend it, highly and without reservation, even to a casual collector, especially now since it has recently gone out of print(ca. 2003-2005, around the time the slipcased, black bonded-leather, US 50th Anniversary edition [ISBN 0-618-51765-0] was published), and is very unlikely to be reissued. It (the Red) listed for $75, and Amazon last sold new copies for $47.50 last January. Now however, fine, used copies are nearing the original list price for the new, and new copies are nearing $100, and very hard to find. Buy one now, as soon as you find one available fine or better.",positive

I still use CDs and prefer them over digital copies (I am dusty that way) and I highly recommend the Harper Collins version over Recorded Books.

Of the many Great Books which are part of the Western Cannon, like Lord of the Rings (LOTR) (as well as The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, and all the rest of Tolkien's many other magnificent works) are like unto far too many other truly profound works of Literary Art of the past: They have been quite deliberately ignored, shunned, loudly ridiculed and sadly under-rated, by the oh-so-snooty Literary and Academic institutional elites of both the USA and Europe.

Lord of the Rings is only just now (over slightly more than just the last decade) is being rightly recognized -- world-wide -- as a truly awesome Magnum Opus; among the very highest (If not THE very highest) body of work of English Literature ever written. Furthermore, LOTR by itself is only now seen on par with of the world's greatest and most developed (complex) epic national mythologies. In this case, a body of English myth written by a single genius over the course of but a single lifetime. (Tolkien began writing about Middle-earth in the trenches of WWI France in 1917.) In contrast, LOTR is quite unlike the great epic mythologies of the distant past: great mythic traditions which evolved by the participation of entire peoples over millennia. However, in this one exceptional case, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and his other mythic works, put together, are indeed the singular work of but one brilliant man's lifetime; he single handedly created something very much on par with the grand mythological (epic) tales of the ancient Western world; in this case quite deliberately for England. Yet, it should be stressed that LOTR was, sadly, rarely seen in this light during Tolkien's lifetime. (C.S. Lewis called it, ""Lightning out of a blue sky."")

Almost miraculously, Lord of the Rings and the rest of Tolkien's other writings, have finally become near-universally seen as well deserving quite close academic study and analysis; are among the best sources of creative inspiration across the various Fine Arts, world wide. Moreover, many of the world's top artists and artisans look to LOTR in particular, as a primary source of mythic inspiration; it has likewise spawned a mammoth, multi-billion dollar subdivision of art, literature, music and movie making: the so-called Fantasy genre.

Lord of the Rings, now, is held up as worthy of the very highest Academic, Artistic/Musical, Philosophical, and Literary institutions and the brightest individuals here in the USA, Europe, and all around the world: For its awesome, majestic beauty of the texts; its stunning imagery; its brilliant depth of meaning; and the rich myriad of deeply moving, profoundly thought-provoking ideas it holds. Thus, like other Great Works of Literature and epic myth, LOTR is filled with both exhilarating triumphs and disturbingly sorrowful tragedies; its timeless concepts, and truly life-altering wisdom; with all its deeply complicated elements, theme connections, and associations which certainly do not all become apparent upon a single casual reading, nor commonly with even several careful readings thereafter.

The Lord of the Rings alone has been translated into over 40 languages: these include French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Danish, Polish, Hebrew, Portuguese, Norwegian, Dutch, Flemish, Turkish, Polynesian, Mongolian, Swedish, Greek, Icelandic, Gaelic, Mandarin & Cantonese Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Swahili, Armenian, Ukrainian, Danish, Finnish, and Korean, to name but a few. Moreover, every translation has thusfar remained a top best-seller in each of their respective language editions. (It's worth noting that LOTR, like all of Tolkien's works, are banned throughout most Mohammedan lands, just as they were too in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia; a region which seems a very real Mordor -- a looming evil for well over the last 1,500 years. Likewise, a very orcish Iran also outright bans -- and openly hates -- Tolkien; quite a ringing endorsement.)

J.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973)
Beloved throughout the world as the creator of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion, and many other works, was a professor of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) at Magdalen College, Oxford; was a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College until his retirement in 1959. His chief interest was the linguistic aspects of the early English written tradition, but while he studied Great classic works of the past, he was creating a set of his own.

After reading LOTR,  The Silmarillion, Second Edition  and then  The Children of Hurin , are are both must-reads. Following that, the  Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth 1st (first) edition Text Only  is also quite worth reading too ...

Lastly, regarding the realm of the Fine Arts, there are a series of breathtaking downloadable MP3's, all by a National Danish classical musical ensemble, various outstanding soloists and a Danish chamber choir, whom are together combined with the amazing voice talents of Sir Christopher Lee; they create an outstanding work of classical-themed music, incorporating the Great English poetry and (previously unscored) song lyrics, from The Lord of the Rings; written of course by J.R.R.Tolkien. The best place to start, is with  Selected Songs and Poems from The Lord of the Rings: Leaving Rivendell  Beyond this, in the realm of Fine Drawings, one need look no further than the monumental work of (now ""Sir"") Alan Lee:  The Lord of the Rings Sketchbook  -- Who's brilliant ideas were used most extensively throughout the excellent, yet slightly flawed,  The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Special Extended Edition) ; by the multiple Academy Award-winning Director, (also now ""Sir"") Peter Jackson.

129,Audible Books & Originals,"The Return of the King: Lord of the Rings, Book 3",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"""The Lord of the Rings"" is usually found in a single volume, or in three volumes: 1) ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", 2) ""The Two Towers"", and 3) ""The Return of the King"". My recommended reading age is 13+ years old, and I recommend reading ""The Hobbit"" first.

When I was 15 years old in high school, I had to read ""The Hobbit"" for an English class. After reading that book, the teacher then let us borrow ""The Lord of the Rings"". Before I had started ""The Return of the King"", I had bought my own set of books. After I had read both books, I actually liked ""The Hobbit"" better than ""The Lord of the Rings"" at first - because ""The Hobbit"" was brighter: a fun, grand adventure with more humor, whereas ""The Lord of the Rings"" was darker: a serious, grim life and death struggle for world survival. But by the time I was about 16, the historical significance of ""The Lord of the Rings"" began to appeal more to me. This is especially true if you read Appendices A and B of ""The Lord of the Rings"", and also read ""The Silmarillion"". You begin to understand the rich history of Tolkien's Middle-Earth/ Beleriand creation. How ""The Silmarillion"" brings out the significant events of the First and Second Ages, while the events in ""The Lord of the Rings"" are the culmination of the Third Age...each Age lasting thousands of years and ending with an immensely significant event.

It was 25 years before I read ""The Lord of the Rings"" again, but Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Aragorn, Galadriel, Legolas, Gimli, and many more had become household names! I had matured over those years, and my tastes changed. I was no longer a big fantasy/science-fiction reader: instead I was reading military history. I didn't expect to still love ""The Lord of the Rings"" the way I did as a teenager. I was happily wrong! This is still an exciting book, but I discovered what I really love...it is allegory-type stories. J. R. R. Tolkien himself has said that ""The Lord of the Rings"" is not allegory, because he hated allegory where he felt the author is dictating to the reader what is in their story...and that any other interpretation is incorrect. Tolkien wanted a reader to apply their own experiences and tastes to influence what they were reading. OK, but in real history one can still get allegory if their own experiences and tastes allow it. How many can learn about World War II and not apply the basic allegorical interpretation that good triumphs over evil? I've heard of, and can understand, several allegorical interpretations of ""The Lord of the Rings"". Frodo is like Jesus Christ: bearing the greatest of burdens for world salvation while being tempted to stray from his purpose, and the weight of the ring is similar to Christ's cross . The One Ring is like the atomic bomb: the ultimate weapon that corrupts whoever uses it, despite even good intentions, into a power-hungry creature of evil. There's an ecological message with the Ents trying to protect trees; and also the natural beauty of various places throughout Middle-Earth, while evil beings try to destroy it all (including the use of mechanical and polluting progress). I also get out of ""The Lord of the Rings"" a sense of a military mission: that Frodo & Sam are behind enemy lines on a mission that could end a war, and that Frodo realizes that getting back home or even staying alive doesn't matter - just completion of the mission...that's also sacrifice, perseverance, & camaraderie so prevalent in the military history I've read. There's prejudice with years of animosity between elves and dwarves, and how small, kind gestures can begin to erase all those blighted years...also, how people or races can put aside differences to solve a common problem. There's the recognition of the small, common people (citizen soldiers) that perform the greatest, toughest, and most necessary duty in any war. There's world peace in peril and that something needs to be done before it's too late. There's avoiding the easier way out, and facing one's problems and seeing them through to a conclusion despite severe hardships.

I feel that Tolkien saw a little bit of himself in many of the good races of his world. The hobbits are like Tolkien because they love food, company, and talking about family. The ents are like Tolkien because of their unbounded love of trees. Gandalf the wizard is like Tolkien because of his exceptional intelligence and purpose of guiding others along the right path. Some men are like Tolkien because of their inner strength and gallantry, while other men show weakness by succumbing to evil...very realistic. But I believe he saw the beauty and enchantment of the elves in his wife, and why he loved both most dearly: that's why on their gravestone Luthien appears after his wife's name, and Beren appears after his name. The dwarves don't seem to resemble Tolkien, but they are present in much folklore, which is linked to his personal love of medieval languages.

""The Lord of the Rings"" is a masterpiece in my opinion, and it's size (over 1000 pages in any printed format) is pretty daunting, but give it a shot! It'll be time well spent. And get ready for adventure, terror, excitement, love, treachery, devotion, monumental historic events, unforgettable battles, military strategy, exotic languages & culture, etc. See what you get out of the book! I think most people will enjoy it and/or be moved by it. And who knows, maybe it'll become your favorite book too!",positive

131,Audible Books & Originals,The Hobbit,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Wow, this was amazing! I liked The Hobbit more than Lord of the Rings, because The Hobbit had a much more reasonable amount of setting description, imo. The setting descriptions were still fantastic and impressive in The Hobbit. I especially enjoyed the word paintings of the Misty Mountains goblin tunnels and the scary Mirkwood.

The character development of Bilbo was pretty good. He really grows as a person, and from reading his internal monologues, I find it easier to connect with and understand him, which I couldn’t do as well in the movies, since we don’t get a direct look into Bilbo’s mind on the silver screen. Thorin Oakenshield seems different in the book; he was overall politer and more considerate than the Thorin in the movies.

Yes, I already know that Tauriel and Legolas are not in the book, and that Tauriel is purely a movie character. But the addition of Tauriel is one of the rare instances where I appreciate the director/ scriptwriter’s artistic liberty. There was also not a single named female character in the book!

It was a delight to see Gollum. He was so creepy yet portrayed so vividly. Tolkien is very good at conveying characters in an evocative way, with dialogue and descriptions of their behaviors.

Furthermore, I enjoyed the humor throughout the book. It was so cute and humorous! The lightheartedness of these funny moments, stood in stark contrast with the darker parts of the story.

I’ve heard some people complain that the Lord of the Rings/ The Hobbit characters tend to be too flat and black-and-white, either all good or all bad. Well, that is in itself a black-and-white statement. I already mentioned the character development of Bilbo. Not only does he change and grow, he also shows both noble and less glamorous sides. Thorin is more complex than he may seem too, but I won’t spoil the plot here. In fact, I would argue that even Gandalf and the Elven king are not single-faceted characters; they have more than one side to them.

I actually got Beorn and Bard mixed up, due to the similarity in their names. Bard was more developed as a character in the movie than in the book, though. Radagast was only mentioned once in passing in the book, so I was glad that he made some significant appearances in the movie!

It was in addition nice to see the less noble sides of the elven race. Even elves can be petty, impulsive, rude, etc. I doubt that we would ever meet a benevolent troll, goblin, or orc, though.

One notable quote in this book, was where Tolkien said that there was one flaw in Bilbo’s plan, and you might have seen it and laughed at him for it. But if you were in his desperate situation, you might not have done half as well yourself. Wow, I loved Tolkien’s quote here, because it underscores what many folks who like to pick at “plot holes” miss. If you’re cool, collected, have no personal involvement in the situation, and have all the time in the world to think, of course you can think of some ingenious strategies that may render the entire journey, quest, or story unnecessary. But do you believe that a person deep inside that situation can think so clearly and come up with such a smart plan in such a short time (often just a few seconds)?

People who poke fun at “plot holes” can sometimes be unrealistic too. I’ve heard of many people say that Frodo and co should have ridden on the great eagles to go to Mount Doom. But in The Hobbit, you see that the eagles were not even willing to fly to Lake Town, lest the men shoot at them. If these great eagles can’t even bear to fly that distance, do you think they would be inclined to go all the way to Mount Doom? And would the eagles be willing to risk being attacked by Saruman or Sauron? Plus, great eagles though they are, Rivendell to Mount Doom is a pretty long distance. Would the eagles want to expend so much time and energy for them? It’s one thing to be in favor of a noble cause (like saving the world). But it’s quite another to offer to spend tons of time, energy, and resources to help people, especially if there’s a chance they can be killed by a dark wizard.

Furthermore, I think the point of having a fellowship of the ring, was not merely to dunk the ring into the fire at Mount Doom. It was also about building character for the adventurers, and having them learn to get along with people of other species. (Most notably, Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf become good friends.)

All in all, this was a wonderful, enjoyable book. I hope to read some of Tolkien’s other works, and especially want to learn more about Radagast.",positive

133,Audible Books & Originals,The Hobbit,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"Some may wonder if J.R.R. Tolkien's story, The Hobbit will still be worth reading now that the movie adaptation by Peter Jackson is complete. Others may want to know if its worth sticking this book within their reading list when compared to all the other great fantasy writers out there like R.A. Salvatore, William King, J.K. Rowling, or George R.R. Martin. I believe the answer is a humongous YES, but I will break this tale down and give out what I view are the pros and cons to delving into this novel; as well as occasionally comparing and contrasting the novel to the movie.
Characters: While Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf are well rounded characters, I personally feel that the dwarves are mostly lacking in individuality and personality. Balin, Dwalin, Oin, Gloin, Dori, Nori, Ori, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Fili, Kili, and Thorin Oakenshield feel like nothing more than foggy sketches to me. While the film has given the dwarves the necessary traits to make them stand out amongst each other, such as Bofur's stiff hat and Oin's ear trumpet, the book leaves out pretty much anything that would make the dwarves stand out from one another. An example:
""`Kili at your service!' said the one. `And Fili!' added the other; and they both swept off their blue hoods and bowed"" (10).
And that is pretty much it. We now know that Kili and Fili have blue hoods, and now the reader is left to add their own ideas to try and distinguish the dwarves from each other. While later on the dwarves do do things to separate themselves from each other, the issue never really goes away because by the time the dwarves do start to try and stand out from each other, they are pretty much all one dwarf already. I even tried to get around this issue (I knew before I reread this book that I had an issue with this in prior readings) I tried to use my Kindle to keep notes on who each of them were, but that eventually involved too many back and fourths which was beginning to ruin the story. Not only are the dwarves lacking, but they are fired at the reader so rapidly that their introductions into the tale feel like a tidal wave of characters, drowning the reader in quickly arriving dwarves. Maybe Tolkien did this overload on purpose to cause the reader to feel closer to Bilbo, for he receives the guests pretty much the same way as the reader does--character overload.
Other characters in the story are given much more description and stand out much better than the dwarves do, such as Gollum:
""Deep down here by the dark water lived old Gollum, a small slimy creature. I don't know where he came from, nor who or what he was. He was Gollum--as dark as darkness, except for two big round eyes in this thin face"" (63).
See, to me that sounds terrifying, and gives the mental eye much more to look at than just blue hoods. A huge flaw when connected to the dwarves, the characters that should be standing out, but luckily, the rest of the characters in the book feel and act alive. One would think though that a book about thirteen dwarves and a hobbit would have the dwarves actually feel solid, and not, background fluff.

Setting: Here we see one of the strong points for Tolkien, and that is Setting. Middle Earth feels alive within these pages, and maybe sometimes too alive. Not only does Tolkien write strong locations, but he really beats the reader over the head with it. I have read so many descriptions of trees that I may actually now be sick of them. In the epic Lord of the Rings this over description of setting is a bad thing, but while I originally hated it in The Hobbit as well, I have found that it is not as bad as I remembered it being here.
""...leading into a gloomy tunnel made by two great trees that leant together, too old and strangled with ive and hung with lichen to bear more than a few blackened leaves"" Tolkien writes about the entrance to Mirkwood (121). Descriptions like that really bring the reader into the story. If Tolkien had applied that same in depth writing to the dwarves, this would have been a five star tale instead of the four stars I am going to give it.

Plot: In the interest of trying to keep my review spoiler free, I'm going to be a bit vague. Regardless, the story is excellent. The reader will meet disgusting creatures, horrific monsters, and travel to far away lands. The beginning is a little slow because the narrator has to establish his voice and explain what Hobbits are, but once the story gets going it is a real page burner. The climatic ending is a little lackluster though, for the event that the whole plot builds to is rushed through in a few paragraphs, and an epic scene that probably could have taken up a few chapters is condensed into one, once again, here and gone in a blink of a few pages.

For those of you who have read the book and are going off to see the film, you will find many scenes and characters that do not appear in the book, or if they are mentioned in the book its like a sentence. For example, my favorite character in the movies, Azog, takes up one whole sentence in the book. I personally hated all the extra stuff that appeared in the movies at first, and honestly I refused to watch the films until recently just because I did not agree on The Hobbit being split into three, three hour films because to me it is just milking the series. After watching them a few times though, I have fallen in love with the movies as well, for other reasons. Each format has its strengths and weaknesses, but I honestly I have to go with the movies being slightly better than the book now, which is shocking because I rarely choose movies over books.

Anyway, I give this novel four beheaded goblins out of five. It is a great read, but it is held back by the fact that the dwarves appear to be an after thought in the book, and the epic ending felt like a ""blink and it is over"" scenario.",positive

135,Audible Books & Originals,The Hobbit,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Giving The Hobbit less than 5 stars is absurd. When one talks about Tolkien ""dilly-dallying and such"" one is referring to his complex style of writing. Quite frankly, Tokien is not ""less,"" he is ""more."" He demands that one pay more attention, he gives one more information. If one wishes to say that more isn't always better, then fine. The rest of us don't expect them to understand. Let me put it this way: It is like Champagne. People don't dislike Champagne, they merely don't understand it. These idiot reviewers ""Larry"", ""Curly"" and ""Moe"" don't prefer the taste of Champagne to 7UP, they simply can't taste it. Is it their limited capacity for intelligence? Is it upbringing? It doesn't really matter what it is, all that matters is that they can't ""taste"" The Hobbit. But those of us who can, can- and we love the taste. After all, we have no choice. These are people who would rather eat Aunt Jemima pancakes with fake syrup than have hot crepes rolled with fine preserves. Really, do the opinions of these people actually count? It is understood by many that an opinion is only an opinion- how untrue this is! In the legal world an opinion is something that is ruled and weighed to be best, to be most true. There _is_ such a thing as a good opinion, even the best opinion. And opinion can be right and an opinion can be wrong. I daresay that giving The Hobbit 3 stars is wrong. And why do I dare? Because if someone told us that cow manure tasted better than ice cream they would be wrong. The bottom line is this: Mozart is better than The Beetles; Ferraris are better than raced out Subarus and Ice Cream does, in fact, taste better than manure. If, like this idiot, you are a simpleton who can can neither hear, taste nor see then don't bother to post your opinions to the rest of us. Instead, take my advice and cozy yourself up with something you can understand like Harry Potter and let yourself float away to the world of un-imagination. You will be much happier and won't have to deal with the headaches of trying to figure out what Tolkien is trying to say, nor will you have to deal with the frustrations of not being able to see in full color and dimensions the Dwarves and Elves and Wizards they way that the rest of us can. I almost pity you, but then, you wasted 60 seconds of my life with degenerate reviews so on second thought, get out of my gene pool and stop breathing my air. It's people like you that make the rest of our lives so two-dimensional by preventing more work like The Hobbit from ever being created with your lack of understanding and abundance of stupidity.

P.S. The Hobbit is a great book, arguably the greatest, certainly the greatest in its own league. It was written by an adult and is absolutely suitable for adults. The fact that it may also be enjoyed and understood by children is only a further credit to Tolkien's genius. Don't let the altogether too commonly found ramblings that this is a book for children discourage you from reading it if you haven't already. While not everyone is capable of enjoying it, it is criminal not to at least expose everyone to this book for anyone who is capable of enjoying it who is denied the oppurtunity has been cheated of one of the finest intellectual pleasures of this past century. My advice to you is to read it slowly and thoroughly. It is an experience like nothing else that will never be quite as magical the second time around.

P.P.S. If you don't know what The Hobbit is about, in short, it is about Adventure. A great Adventure full of Swords and Magic; of Dwarves and of Elves and of Wizards and Hobbits; Good, Evil; Trolls and Goblins; Suspense, Excitement, Comedy and Tragedy; Music, Riddles and Poetry. All of this presented in one of the most unique styles of writing ever encountered; a style of writing that paints every detail of Tolkien's fantastic world in your mind as if you were there. Not a single word is wasted and every element of the story is to be enjoyed. If any of these things sound even remotely fascinating then read this book- you won't be disappointed.

P.P.P.S. Comments about the illustrated versions for those trying to decide between the two illustrated versions of The Hobbit done by Alan Lee and Michael Hague: I recommend the Michael Hague edition hands down. The illustrations seem to fit the book much more than Lee's. Lee's anything but poor, but Mague's are more merry, bright and rich. The characters appear heartier and the colors set a better mood. More simply put, when I look at Lee's illustrations I feel like I'm standing in the dining room of somebody's grandmother- wallpaper, china dolls, lace and all- they just seem old and dry. Hague's characters, the dragon especially, seem more believable- when I turn the page I don't get a feeling like what I'm looking at is out of place. Another difference with Hague is that I am confident that anybody would enjoy his illustrations, but with Lee I merely see why some people 'might prefer it.' Hague really does have that illustration feeling I expect to see in a book; Lee's look like they belong on a museum wall. Also, I feel that Hague took a more direct interpretation of the book while Lee seemed to illustrate as he liked to fit his own style without much less regard to the book. Still, before buying I suggest you sample the art on the internet just to be sure of your tastes. However, if you're uncertain then I am confident that you and especially your children will enjoy Hague.",positive
136,Audible Books & Originals,The Hobbit,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"*The Hobbit* is one of the most beloved books of all time. Though actually originally written as a children's story, it almost immediately transcended such a classification, and through the years many adults have read the delightful story of a small, but tough Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.

Most folks know the basic premise of the story. If not from reading it, then certainly they know part of it from the prologue to *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* movie, and likely went out to learn the rest of the tale. A wizard, Gandalf the Grey, goes and visits the son of an old Hobbit friend, and after spending time with him, surreptitiously marks Bilbo's door with a sign that is an advertisement of services for a professional burglar.

The dwarves that Gandalf was helping look for a burglar promptly knock on poor Bilbo's door, and up he finds himself enlisted in an adventure to slay a dragon and find lost gold. Initially the dwarves belittle Bilbo, and this just makes him all the more determined to prove them wrong about him, which attitude he does, to put it mildly, regret more than once on their quest. Eventually he finds the Ring and the adventures are many, but that is too much of a spoiler for this review. Suffice it to say, it is one grand adventure after another.

It is said that the Hobbit was published on the recommendation of the publisher's son, who heartily endorsed the tale. It also was published on the strong recommendation of Tolkien's friends, including C. S. Lewis. Tolkien was a man of a very exacting nature. The debt owed to Tolkien's close circle of family, friends, and a few close academic peers is incalculable. For their insistence that Tolkien merely ""publish it already"" ensured the book kept the whimsical tone it may otherwise have lost.

*The Hobbit* is often criticized, to be sure, for not having the extremely ""serious"" tone and ""complex"" plot lines of its sequel, *The Lord of the Rings*. While this criticism is perfectly fair, it also greatly misses the point. Yes, Tolkien included fantasy elements in the story derived from the epic fictional history of Britain that he was writing. But that was all that these were, small derivatives. There was not a concerted effort when he wrote the *children's* story, to include all of these. Indeed, while Tolkien had to go back and rewrite the section ""Riddles in the Dark"" to make the story of the Ring and Gollum coincide with the overall story of *The Lord of the Rings*, that is as far that he was able to go. He realized that to make the tone and story of *The Hobbit* match that of it's sequel would effectively make it no longer the fun story that everyone loved.

So the question is, what is *The Hobbit*? What kind of story is it? It is lighter, but with a sense of foreboding. It is the story of a fat, happy, contented age coming to a close in a devastating war that will change the face of the earth. It is the origin of a story that is an attempt to explain how a variety of myths can be true.

To this, many may object that *The Silmarillion* is the beginning of the story, but this is untrue. *The Silmarillion* is the beginning of *all* stories, and only concerns the events of the later periods of Middle-Earth very faintly, and near the end of that epic narrative. It is the Creation myth, one that connects with the Christian faith of the author surprisingly well.

In fact, the light-hearted tone of *The Hobbit* is the pefect bridge for the reader. It is the most ""modern"" in perspective, and introduces the reader to the peoples, geography, and events that they will find are connected from the First and Second Ages in *The Silmarillion* and the Third Age in *The Lord of the Rings*.

J. R. R. Tolkien didn't like allegory, as he himself attested, but he did try to do ""applicability"", which is really just a way of saying that he didn't directly do ""x = x"" in the story, but allowed his Christian worldview to mesh with ancient epics in an effort to reconcile the two differing myths, or as he later convinced Lewis, to separate the ""one, True Myth"" to which the other myths copy and pay homage.

Perhaps the most important link, however, to *The Lord of the Rings*, however, (besides the Ring itself, of course) is the importance of characters and the emphasis on certain truths and values. Among these are loyalty, the Providence of God, and the simultaneous righteousness and brutality of warfare.

Before entering the military after the outbreak of World War I, Tolkien and his closest friends, who made up the core of a club that was likely the inspiration for the later Inklings and other clubs Tolkien loved to found at the various colleges at which he taught, had this notion of the glory of war, and how they would find renown for their deeds. This is shown in the perspective of Bilbo and the other heroes at the end of the story. While they were happy to have won the battle against evil, they also felt the horrors of war quite keenly.

For the careful and patient reader, this book contains so many nuggets of truth for a ""children's"" book. It is most definitely *not* only a simple story. It is WELL worth your time.

150,Audible Books & Originals,Greenlights,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"I had a 12 hour drive to Florida ahead of me and I wanted to listen to a good book. I couldn’t decide but as soon as I brought up Audible, Matthew McConaughey's book, “Greenlights' ', was listed at the top of the biographies. I’ve read a number of good biographies, and I like Matthew McConaughey, primarily since he appeared in the movie Contact with Jodie Foster. ""Contact"" by Carl Sagan is one of my favorite books. His portrayal of the mysterious man of God, in that movie, was so good it launched his career. Apart from his good looks, he really sold the “Man of the Cloth'' to the audience. And maybe that’s because, after reading his book, in his real life McConaughey is a man of great spirituality. That said, you will not find his religion in any orthodox church. He is entirely unorthodox having created his spirituality in the church of life and penned his own belief system based upon the green light of a traffic signal. It’s all about how we avoid the reds and yellows and take the greens. This is what he based his premise for Greenlights…not disrupting the flow, but allowing what comes at you to continue. Compare that to the philosophy of “The Art of Racing in the Rain”, by Garth Stein, a book of tragic circumstance--that you must see in advance, that what manifests before you-- so as not to lose your grip on the road of life. The analogy to driving is there in both cases but in McConaughey's life, which is unlike most common people, after a few good turns and basket full of optimism, he was set up to avoid the red lights all together and thus blow though any yellows if it became necessary. Not that that’s a bad thing, it's just very uncommon. Most of us get traffic tickets.

Despite a well crafted read (or listen) I was disappointed that it appears McConaughey has never read “The Great Gatsby”. Whereas Gatsby’s “Green Light” is a little different, to not mention the most famous green light in literary history, in a book called Greenlights, is a tremendous faux pas. Despite his talents he does not appear to be well read. Had he known, he would have included it...or least explained why it doesn’t apply to his life. I blame the publisher. From my perspective, McConaughey deeply believes in the Green Light. “The orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter. Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.” Come on!! This is exactly the optimism of McConaughey’s “Greenlights”. Maybe it was a fear of copyright infringement, however it literally entered the public domain on 1 January, 2021. Perhaps they didn’t want to wait. But the absence of reference is critical to me.

Not to detract from McConaughey’s intellect. I was surprised that he is indeed a keen observer of life. He has enormous self awareness and introspection. So much introspection that he has been compelled to trek the world in search of the source for inspiration he finds in his dreams. Again, the common person does not have the means to go on these extended journeys of discovery on multiple continents. What’s amazing to me is he kept a journal and a scrap book for most of his life. He's traveled to Europe, Australia, Africa, South America, almost on a whim. He kept many journals as a deep record of his thoughts, feelings, and the inner workings of his soul. Anyone who reads it will be better for it. It makes me wish I had kept a journal. And because I’ve always been fond of bumper stickers he had me early with his call out to the importance of these early memes. We all have bumper stickers for our own lives...he just remembered to keep them...or write them down.

The other thing I really like about McConaughey, apart from definitely being a man of letters, is that he is a poet. Perhaps his profession has trained him to be this man of words. Or perhaps, his ability to use words, has aided him in his profession. And he has grown in the role so fully that he is now a master. So can there be any doubt that he’s written his own book? What’s doubly appealing, that, as an actor, he narrates his audio-book. I can tell you, the time I spent listening to his story while driving to Florida, in his words, through his voice and characterizations, was as entertaining as any of his movies. However you do miss his scrapbook of pictures in the audiobook version. Had I had it to do over, I would listen and read the book in front of me. Alas. it is doubtful I will give Greenlights a second read. In today’s world, reading one book, and making it through, is a high complement with so many classics to read and reread. Alas I will not reread, but perhaps use as a reference and I certainly recommend it.

I’m a fan of McConaughey, this book is for his fans, and will no doubt win some new ones. I will continue to be a fan and recommend this book to those who would like to see, feel, (and hear in the case of an audio-book) a man’s life that has been well considered and well lived. And he’s only 50. I’m going to start with 4-stars for Matthew. Deduct 1-star for missing the criticality of Gatsby’s Green Light, and then add 1-star back for his narration of the audio-book. Well done Matthew!",positive

Matthew McConaughy

5 Diamond Review
💎💎💎💎💎

Greenlights, written by Matthew McConaughy is one of the best autobiographies I have ever read and listened to. I ordered it first on Audible. I enjoyed the book so much, I ordered a hard copy as well. The actor narrated Greenlights himself and hands down he has spoiled me for every other book I will ever listen to. His flow while he narrates his book is flawless. It’s as if he just called me on the phone and decided to tell me his stories. He narrates his book with such ease of voice you feel like you are just listening to a friend talk. This book, his manner of reading it to us and his over all story is amazing. This did not feel like a memoir but like a motivational book. It does not sound like he’s reading anything. He does a great job keeping the book fluid and you can easily follow the timeline he has laid out. I listened to it twice before I moved on to the next audiobook. It will be a book I will listen to again.

He really just seems like a very down to earth and ‘normal’ person. I feel fame has not gone to his head. He is honest and brutal and captivating all at the same time. I have listened to it twice.

Let’s talk about the actual content of this book. Matthew McConaughy has lived an adventurous life. He has had the means to do things that he wants to do financially as an adult and fortitude as a child and I am fascinated with his choices. He doesn’t sugar coat his words. From describing his parent’s tumultuous relationship and in the end accepting it as the only way they knew how to love to recounting memories of going to Australia or Africa. His stories are funny, sad, nail biters and anything in-between.

I am enthralled with his great story telling ability. I am also impressed with his life. I believe that he is a ‘down to earth’ type man who accepts all people for who they are and what they can personally offer of themselves under whatever circumstance. He seems to always be open to learning something new. He does not seem to have the attitude that he knows ‘it’ all already. He seems to be the type of person who makes a commitment and he keeps it at all costs. He lives his life on his own terms and I absolutely appreciate that.

He includes pictures and side notes with his tales and it really is fun to look at the pictures of him throughout his life. He takes the red lights and turns them green in his life. He is a progressive thinker and I admire that. Even if something seems to not be going right, he waits for the situation to produce something positive.

Matthew McConaughy is true to himself and who he is as a person. He does not come across as arrogant or cocky. He tells his stories with gusto and with every lesson in life that he grew up with. He has chosen adventures that teach him something. He has followed his life journey with a passion. He isn’t stuck in a inflexible mind frame. As we read we can understand his thought process and some of what really makes him tick as a human being. He allows himself to adapt as he grows as a person. He is not rigid or regimented. He throws himself into his work when he works 200% and he allows himself to relax when he needs to.

He draws on his past, present and future while he weaves his narrative. I am equally impressed with the people he surrounds himself with. Including his wife. He picked right. He describes her in a way that makes me believe that she is just as down to earth as he is. She was not impressed with his name and fame. She made him work for their relationship. I love the fact that even though he is a successful actor, he acts like a ‘normal’ person in situations he is faced with. He traveled around the country in an airstream, taking up residence in rv parks and campgrounds, and making friends with people all along the way. He doesn’t seem to think he is special just because he is an actor. However he knows he is special for just being human and he values other people in the same way.

Of course, this is all my opinion from reading and listening to this book – he could be full of it. But I don’t think so. Although if he is, it’s okay – he really sells it and makes it believable and entertaining.

Again, I give the book, both hard bound and audio, five diamonds. I recommend it for everyone.",positive

That line - which I won't spoil for you - was my very own ""launchpad line"". My world could hardly be more different, but I had a hunch that there was something in this book for me.

I was right.

This book is a reckoning of McConaughey's life so far. From modest beginnings to the pinnacle of success as an actor, I found it to be a life lived with purpose. The introspection to illuminate that purpose. The deliberation to seek it. And the awareness to course-correct.

There's as much to learn from his story, as from the truths and maxims he has distilled from it. The prose rivals the poems.

It's also hilarious, endlessly quotable, and one of those books you'll get more out of on every re-read. Definitely recommended!",positive
153,Audible Books & Originals,Greenlights,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"Greenlights is a remarkable first book from an already renowned artist. Kind of a mashup of Anthony Bourdain with Ernest Hemingway, McConaughey tells stories with the aplomb of accomplished raconteur. Part memoir, part life guide and part ethic Greenlights is worth reading for many beyond McConaughey’s fan base; basically anyone who likes a good man’s man adventure story.

Born into the lower middle class in East Texas, McConaughey looks back nostalgically at a childhood few would envy. His parents divorced and remarried each other twice, he was subject to corporal punishment and money was always an issue. Yet he doesn’t complain about disadvantage. In fact he honors his parents despite their shortcomings. He adheres to a philosophy of choosing to recalibrate what seems like the inevitable until it turns into a green light or way forward in life.

After a rite of passage involving brawling with a barroom bouncer, McConaughey pursued acting with the drive and hard work ethic that was instilled into him. Finding early success, he choose to live in a way directly opposite to the Hollywood scene. Traveling the country with his dog, going off on expeditions to the middle of Africa and South America, McConaughey sees livin (drop the g to indicate it’s always a verb) as more than just the material success and creature comforts many of us settle on.

Finally, after years of womanizing, McConaughey settled into a successful monogamous relationship and fulfilled his life long ambition of being a father. Nearly simultaneously he chose to walk away from lucrative rom-coms to focus on something more artistic. Initially successful in winning an Oscar for the Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey admits that he hasn’t achieved the popular success he envisioned. But that is all grist for the mill, experiments in livin that are ongoing.

If this is the kind of man you would like to read about, Greenlights will be an enjoyable and inspirational read. It’s rare that a successful actor has such a distinctive off air personality. But if you’re turned off by physical conflict, wild adventures and a man who brags about rarely showering alone than Greenlights is not for you.

Personally, while not finding all parts of McConaughey’s biography admirable, I found enough of him to be so different than what Hollywood typically churns out that the book was worth reading. Recommended to all who feel they’re similarly traveling in unmapped regions and want to gather around the campfire to hear a fellow wanderer’s tales.",positive

157,Audible Books & Originals,Greenlights,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I knew I needed to read this memoir. Didn’t know why though? But I think I do now. Just finished it. I didn’t grow up with a mentor. A baby needs it’s mother. A boy needs his father. I don’t blame my own for not being there. He was later in life... and that counts for a hell of a lot. Never felt comfortable around men growing up. Didn’t feel a part of the club. Had an incredibly strong mother though. She filled both roles best she could. Did a damn fine job considering. I found myself attaching to characters in films. Actors. They were the only teachers I could learn from that didn’t ask questions at the end of the lesson. I could be a silent student of how a man should conduct himself. I probably built my entire structure of self from a collage of characters in films circa 1983-2003. Of course I had NO IDEA who I was until I was 35. And let me tell you.... I didn’t like the guy that I “thought” I was. I was all the darkness and brood of all of my favorite lost, troubled characters with tiny remnants of light shining through the more redeeming, shiny honorable ones. Of course it would only make sense that I would need another actors book to lead me to the next ascension of my “manhood”. He made it basic with his approach. I’m going to tell you this story. You’re going to read along. You’re either going to connect the dots and apply... or simply turn the page and move on. I realized that I seriously lack the hard work and conviction to truly climb my mountaintop. Let me tell you... I have some high peaks set for myself. With absolutely NO climbing experience. Want to soar through the clouds like a hawk but I’m scared of heights. Of course I’ve learned a few tricks along the way. I’ve lived a damn fine life by some standards. A calamitous train wreck by others. Earned my scars. Tattooed my place like only a beating chest man can. But deep down inside I still feel like a boy. A boy in a rudderless sailboat. Seasick. Vertigoed. Virgo-ed. (See what I did there;) Back to the book. I read of a man that I had little interest in. Matthew McConaughey. Always seemed abit too cleancut for me. A bit too All-American. The quarterback. The outdoorsey, fisherman. Cool southern drawl with a laissez faire attitude. Crossbred with a stoned surfer So-Cal vibe. Nah, not for me. I like my actors to be a little rougher around the edges. Razor edges at that. Near death even. *im working on changing that appeal* But his work in True Detective especially perked my ears and eyes. Maybe there’s something more to this Hollywood cowboy. Speaking of Hollywood~ I lived there for 9 years and 8 months. I’m proud of that. Not so proud of my lack of productivity whilst living there but that’s another story for another time. Anyhow, the reason I write this is that I can’t say enough about “Greenlights”. I laughed, I cried, I thought a lot about my life and how it went all wrong. I mean... i don’t want anyone else’s life. I want my own. I just want to taste the sweet, cold mountain air of that damned peak I wish to summit. I just don’t have the tools yet. But I’m acquiring them. This year has been hell for many. But it’s been healing for me. I’ve let go of some serious flaws. Really worked on letting go of that boyish mindset. (While keeping some of the fun parts;) I guess the main truth that I took away from the read was that I have to be MY OWN HERO. The lead of MY MOVIE. Rooting for ME to conquer the mountain. Stop being a silent observer. Waiting for the perfect time. The time is NOW. J K LIVIN. Maybe for those of you that need the same thing in your lives.... That nudge in the right direction. This book can help put things into perspective. It’s written by a man who wants to help his fellow man. Yes, a man that’s lived an extraordinary life. But his story didn’t start out extraordinary.

Holy bananas Colleen Hoover just demolished me. Completely and 100% blew me away…not that I’m surprised or anything because she never ceases to amaze me but…OMG! Let the book hangover commence because this one is going to be a doozy to recover from. I was pulled in from the beginning and giving the angsty ride of my life...and I loved every second of it!

Elizabeth Tate Collins...where do I begin with Tate. I freakin adored her...I couldn’t help myself. I can’t even tell you the exact moment when it happened or what pushed me over the edge…she took me by storm. Tate really is a force to be reckoned with. She’s so freaking smart…already a nurse at the age of 23 and pursuing her master’s degree in nursing…she’s driven, focused and determined…genuine, kind and caring…but she’s not a pushover. I loved her sense of humor…she’s sweet, funny and sassy. She’s got her own little quirks but I just found them more adorable. I liked her attitude and I think, as usual, the key for me was that I was totally emotional connected to her. Everything she felt…I felt. I related to her in some ways, but that wasn’t even the half of what drew me to her. Tate is a very compelling heroine…she’s just one of these extremely relatable girls that is easy to fall in love with…and it’s easy to see why Miles did as well..

‘Something strange is going on in my chest. A flutter, flutter kind of thing. I hate it, because I know what it means. It means my body is really starting to like Miles.
I just hope my brain never catches up.'

Miles Mikel Archer...oh Jesus Lord in heaven this boy, where do I even begin. He stole my heart…held my heart...he crushed my heart...and then he healed my heart. As closed off and emotionally detached as Miles was, I was still incredibly drawn to him...and that's saying something considering I am an emotional reader. I think it's because the glimpses of emotion that we get in the beginning from him are like moments of gold...I clung to those because they were just...so amazing! Knowing how much those affected me...how could I not want more?!? I swear…the moment he stroked Tate’s foot and cracked a smile I was DONE FOR people. Just done. I know…I sound crazy, but that boy melted my heart and he continued to do so for the remaining 80% of the book. Oh Miles…Miles Miles Miles…every time I thought I had no more feels left to give…he painfully extracted them from my body…every time I thought he cannot be more perfect (yes…even with his walls!)…he proved me wrong with his words and actions. Miles is very understated...he’s sexy but it’s not shoved in your face and he doesn’t act like a conceited @#% hat. He’s successful but he doesn’t brag about it or let it go to his head. He’s sweet, kind and thoughtful…but its like he doesn’t want anyone to know. But Tate knows…

‘I’ve always been a sucker for the quiet types of guys. Primarily because most guys talk too much, and it’s painful having to suffer through every single thought that goes through their heads. Miles makes me wish he were the opposite of the quiet type, though. I want to know all the thoughts that pass through his head. Especially the one thought that’s in there right now, hiding behind that unwavering, stoic expression.’

Hmm...how do I describe Miles and Tate...hot...sensual...electric...passionate...just YES! How can it not be? Their relationship is based of one thing...sex. Now…before we get crazy, it’s not erotica, it’s tasteful but it’s still sexy as hell. Heck…everything about Miles and Tate was sexy and addictive…I truly could not get enough of them. I thrived off of Miles and Tate together...they are just that amazing. You could see even in the littlest things how happy and complete he made her and as much as he tried to fight it, I could tell she was chipping away at that hardened shell. It was hard though…seeing the impact of his decisions and what that did to Tate…it hurt my heart, but…I never once questioned her decisions. I was waiting for that point when I would get frustrated or angry with what Tate was doing…it didn’t come. I got it…because I understood her feelings for him…I would have done the same thing! Truly, the thought of her walking away from him killed me more than the angst they were experiencing.

‘He brings his hands up and slides them through my hair, brushing his thumbs across my cheeks. He inhales a shaky breath while looking down at my mouth. “You make it so hard to breathe.”
He punctuates his sentence with his kiss, bringing his lips over mine. Every remaining part of me that had yet to melt in his presence is now liquefied like the rest of me. I try to recall a time when a man’s mouth felt this good against mine. His tongue slides across my lips, then dips inside, tasting me, filling me, claiming me.
Oh….my.
I.
Love.
His.
Mouth.’

Tate and Miles are so…unique. I loved that we got both of their POV’s…I love the way both of their POV’s are presented…and I’m being intentionally vague on that because I don’t want to spoil things because that was part of the surprise for me. I wasn’t expecting to get both but it was honestly genius and a totally different approach. I guess…the best way for me to describe without giving too much away is that I fell in love with Miles twice…which is probably why he got to me so deeply. You get to see two very different sides to him, both of them are amazing and wonderful (hence…the falling in love) but that’s where my struggle began. Now…before I go on, we’ve established, I love Miles…I love everything I know about him and every second I learned more I fell more…I love the good, the bad and the ugly…I felt like a part of my heart broke with him…I shed tears for him…flaws and all he is still perfect in my eyes. So…here’s the problem…I was so connected with Tate and feeling her pain…so I was getting double duty pain…with her and for him…it sometimes felt like I was being ripped in two. The struggle is real…

‘A kiss is so much easier than what we’re doing. When you kiss, you can close your eyes. You can kiss away the thoughts. You can kiss away the pain, the doubt, the shame. When you close your eyes and kiss, you protect yourself from the vulnerability.
This isn’t us protecting ourselves.
This is confrontation. This is a standoff. This is eye-to-eye combat. This is a dare, from me to Miles, from Miles to me. I dare you to try to stop this, we’re both silently screaming.’

I could babble on and on all day about these two…but that’s not all there is. There are two other very important men in Tate’s life and I thoroughly enjoyed the relationships she had with them. First…her brother Corbin…he is the typical older brother, super protective, loving to a fault and no one is good enough for his little sister. I liked their closeness…at a time when Tate needed someone, he was there for her in his own way and they had a very easy relationship…except when it comes to Tate’s dating life, but I thought it was cute that he was so caring and wanted what was best for her. In all honesty…if it wasn’t for Corbin…there would be no Tate and Miles…so it’s really all his fault. Then we have Cap….his real name is Samuel but it just looks weird calling him that cause…well, he’s Cap. He’s an 80 year old man that turned into one of Tate’s closest friends and I don’t think I could have loved their relationship more if I wanted to. He was this little injection of comedic relief, his timing was perfect and there is no other word for Cap besides awesome.

‘“What do you think would make a man never want to experience love again?”
Cap doesn’t answer my question for at least five floors. I eventually look at him, and he’s looking right at me, his eyes narrowed, producing even more wrinkles between them. “I suppose if a man lived through the ugliest side of love, he might never want to experience it again.”
I contemplated his answer, but it doesn’t help much. I don’t see how love could get ugly enough for a person to just shut himself off from it completely.’

Of course the writing is absolutely flawless…it’s Colleen Hoover, there was never any doubt in my mind. I’m in awe of her. I literally don’t feel like I’m reading when I read her books…it’s an experience…I live it with the characters. I immerse myself in her stories and I think it’s genuinely impossible not to walk away from them a changed human. Every sentence blends perfectly…the flow is smooth…I’m just effortlessly pulled in. It’s torture to stop reading and you never want the journey to end. I liked that this book was a little different from some of her others…but it still had that CoHo vibe to it – her tone is still there, the characters still have that special edge that make them classically hers, but it was just a little more mature. Seriously, the one common thing with all of her books is the level of emotion that she pours into them…especially this one. Every time I think there is no way she can out do it…can make me cry again…can angst my heart out more…can create characters that I can love to bits and pieces…and yet she does. Every. Single. Time. It’s brilliant wrapped in genius dipped in amazing…shot straight through my brain and into my heart.

‘She’s absolutely beautiful. Her hope is beautiful. The smile on her face is beautiful. The tears streaming down her cheeks are beautiful.
Her
love
is
beautiful.’

I am a self professed clinger…and I’m struggling to let go of Miles and Tate but…I can’t deny…Ugly Love is a perfect standalone. Do I think Corbin deserves a book? Your darn tootin’…that boy is a man whore and I LOVE my man whores…he is a recipe for awesome in the making when combined with Colleen’s brain…but that still doesn’t change that I couldn’t have asked for anything better than the way Miles and Tate’s story ended. It was perfection…big red bow and all. I laughed…I cried…I loved…it was beautiful and ugly and everything I wanted and I will never look at water the same way again.",positive

Colleen Hoover is a genius, plain and simple. I’ve read Slammed/Point of Retreat/This Girl and Maybe Someday/Maybe Not and I’ve loved them all, but after reading Ugly Love I can easily say that this was my favorite CoHo book that I’ve read so far! This woman has such a way with words, her writing is just a joy to read, even when she’s tearing your heart out. I don’t know how she does it, she doesn’t use big fancy words or complicated prose, these are just ordinary everyday words but the way she puts them all together is simply magical. It’s hard for me to describe, but if you’ve read any CoHo books I think you know what I’m talking about. All of her stories are so unique and amazing but one thing they all have in common is Colleen Hoover’s gift with words. I know exactly what I’ll be getting when I pick up one of her books in terms of writing and quality, but I am always surprised with the direction her stories take. It’s always an incredible adventure and I love going along for the ride.

I loved how this book was narrated, it’s told from dual POVs, alternating every other chapter between Tate and Miles. The thing that made this book unique is that Tate’s chapters were set in the present day and (with the exception of the last few chapters) all of Miles’ chapters were set 6 years earlier. So we essentially get two separate love stories that are both wonderful and beautiful that come back together in such a great way. I loved getting Miles’ backstory in the form of these flashback chapters, first off they were so amazingly written, they just flowed like poetry and I found myself lost in these simple words:

‘My new favorite flavor is Rachel. My new favorite thing is Rachel. I want Rachel for my birthday. I want Rachel for Christmas. I want Rachel for graduation. Rachel, Rachel, Rachel. I’m gonna fall in love with you anyway, Rachel.’

Secondly, in Tate’s chapters Miles really is an enigma and without his current day POV you really don’t have much clue what’s going on behind that wall he’s put up:

‘Still no smile, though. Jesus Christ, this man. Does he now realize that facial expressions are supposed to accompany speech?’

But reading his flashback chapters really helped understand what Miles’ potential to love was. Before you find out what happened to him in the past that caused him to be so closed off you get to see what a huge heart he has and his great capacity for love. This book was just as much Miles and Rachel’s love story as it was Miles and Tate’s story, you’d think that as a reader you’d have ill feelings towards the “other woman” because you know you should be rooting for Tate but there’s none of that. I felt Miles and Rachel’s story just as fully as I did him and Tate.

Colleen Hoover’s characters are always so well written, they are well developed, incredibly detailed and 100% relatable. I totally loved Tate, she was a riot and she said and did things that I could see myself doing in those situations and I connected with her right away. I loved her inner musings as she tried to figure Miles out or tried to soak up any little scrap of hope he threw her way:

‘“You look pretty, Tate.” I want to plaster those four words on a billboard and require myself to pass it on my drive to work every day. I would never take another day off work again.’

There were some times when Miles would do something where Tate totally should have walked away, but I think she reacted how many women would react and I know that she didn’t give up completely on Miles because she knew what was happening between them was real even though he would never admit it. Miles intrigued me from the start and from their first meeting where she witnessed his very private breakdown I knew that I was in for a doozy when his past was revealed. I knew he must have endured some horrible event(s) that caused him to swear off any form of love, and wow was he dedicated to his rules:

“Don’t ask about my past,” he says firmly. “And never expect a future.”

I’ve never seen a character hold so steadfastly to rules like he did. We got to see moments, tiny glimpses of actions or a slipped word that gave us some hope but just as quickly as we grasped that hope he snatched it right back. I was so sad for him and falling so in love with him at the same time (much like Tate, only with the added bonus of seeing what a wonderful guy he was six years earlier when he was still full of life and love) and I just wanted to hug him. My heart completely broke for him as his full past is finally revealed, and I will say that what actually happened was not at all what I was expecting. But I love how once we hit that point the story shifts to all present day and it’s seamless and I love how it put my heart back together again and wrapped up in a totally believable and satisfying way.

In addition to Tate and Miles I loved all of the secondary characters. I’ve already mentioned Rachel and I did really love her. I also loved Corbin and his friendship with Miles and his protectiveness of his sister. I also liked seeing Ian and Miles’ relationship both in the past and in the present day. My favorite secondary character however was Cap, I LOVED Cap! I love how Colleen Hoover can throw in a quirky random character like this and make you totally fall in love with them and have them end up being so important to the overall story.

I read this book over the course of a few hours spread out the day, I simply could not put it down. I struggled though because I wanted to read as fast as I possibly could to find out what happens next but at the same time I wanted to slow down to savor every single word on the page! In the end speed won out but I think I highlighted half the book with passages I wanted to always remember! I’m going to have to re-read this book someday because I don’t think one time is enough for something written as well as this was. I’m sad I don’t have more time with Miles and Tate but I am so glad that I was able to spend one wonderful afternoon/evening in their world with them and I know I will never forget this amazing, beautiful, ugly love story! 5+++ stars!

And boy does she know how to write it because there was not one second during this book that I didn't have my heart bleeding in a table somewhere. Bleeding, you say, this can't be good, right? Oh, but it is so right because Hoover knows how to gut you, draw and quarter you, and then slowly sew you back together again. I know going into a Hoover book that it won't be pretty, but I do it anyway because in the end, she makes the story well worth the ride.

Blurb from Goodreads:
Never ask about the past.
Don’t expect a future.
When Tate Collins meets airline pilot Miles Archer, she knows it isn’t love at first sight. They wouldn’t even go so far as to consider themselves friends. The only thing Tate and Miles have in common is an undeniable mutual attraction. Once their desires are out in the open, they realize they have the perfect set-up. He doesn’t want love, she doesn’t have time for love, so that just leaves the sex. Their arrangement could be surprisingly seamless, as long as Tate can stick to the only two rules Miles has for her. They think they can handle it, but realize almost immediately they can’t handle it at all.
Hearts get infiltrated.
Promises get broken.
Rules get shattered.
Love gets ugly

Imagine a tragedy so terrible it makes you never want to put yourself out there for love again. Now imagine having someone enter your life that you try your hardest not to love because there is no way on this earth you could ever love again. Now scramble your brain. Yup, that's pretty much this book.

Tate moves to San Fransisco to live with her brother and go to school. What she doesn't expect is to be attracted to her brother's very hot, very closed off, and totally not willing to love next door neighbor. But who is capable of ignoring matters of the heart? I loved this character. She is starts off as a strong and very well rounded. She knows what she wants, and does what she needs to have at least a little part of it. And, like many NA characters, she can't ignore what her heart feels. I found her very relatable and realistic. Does she have weaknesses, she sure does. Her weakness is not being able to stay away from someone who she feels such a great connection to she just knows there must be a way to break through. But you can't change someone unless they want to change, right? One thing that bothers me about Tate is that she does show more weakness during the book than I would have liked. Yet, I understood the need for her to have this weakness. And as much as I wanted to chastise her for it. one cannot go lightly into such deep affairs of the heart and not show weakness at some point.

Enter Miles. Sexy, swoon worthy, pilot Miles Archer has a lifetime of tragedy behind him at only 24 years old. And he won't open his heart to anyone. He's a mystery that Tate can't figure out, as much as she wants to. But Miles has his rules: he won't talk about the past and he has no intention of creating any kind of future. He's straight forward and to the point about it. At first, this made me mad at him. Had it not been for his chapters, I'm pretty sure I would have thrown this book up against the wall a number of times with the anger he caused me. But it isn't that Miles in incapable of love, it's that he doesn't want his heart to get hurt. He's closed and unpredictable, and his mystery was something I wanted to crack wide open. He reminded me a bit of Christian Grey. I know I know, don't punch me, why on earth would I ever compare Hoover to James? Well, I'm not, I'm just saying that some of the qualities you see in Christian are there with Miles. But in the end, his reasons for being who he is are sad and powerful. Miles was one of the most heartbreaking characters I have ever had the chance to get to know.

Hoover has this way of flaying you open, making your heart bleed out all over the place until you have almost nothing left to give. And then, in one foul swoop, she redeems herself and sews you back together, little piece by agonizing piece. Her words are powerful. She writes like a musician, creating lyrics that drag you along, even if you feel like you don't want to go. Her words are a powerful tool and weapon against her readers for sure. And with each book she writes, she gets better and better at showing us how broken people can really be. But she also shows us how they are capable of mending and healing and becoming whole again.

This book is definitely a bit more racey then her past stuff. Darker and different than what you have seen from her in the past. While most of Hoovers books have focused on the story behind the plot, this one really jumps into the sexy. But the sexy is the whole point of this story. Because without the sexy, there would be no connection formed with Tate and Miles. And then their story would have gone nowhere at all. Friends with benefits takes on a whole new meaning when you watch Tate and Miles together. Their attraction is undeniable, but there is so much more underneath, so much more depth to their experiences together. And that just makes the book that much more engrossing.

There is one word I use whenever I describe Hoover's books. One word that always ends up in my status updates on Goodreads. Because there is only one word that can show exactly how Hoover's books make me feel. And that word is INTENSE. The intensity of her writing, her plot lines, the connections between her characters cause a physical ache in my heart. I'm not much of a crier when it comes to reading, but Hoover always seems to be able to pull the tears from me.

Tough Critic Book Reviews summed this book up perfectly, so I will quote her: ""This is definitely a story about loss, but more importantly an excruciatingly painful story about love"" And excruciatingly painful it is. This is a nonstop, un-put-downable book that will leave your heart aching in ways you never thought possible. Just when I think Hoover can't make a story any better than she has in the past, she surpasses what she did before. I don't know how she does it, but I don't care. All I know is that I cannot wait to see what she gives us next.",positive

165,Audible Books & Originals,Ugly Love,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"This is the first book I have read by Colleen Hoover and I enjoyed every second of it. I am always receiving recommendations from book tok, bookstagram, or book YouTube accounts. Collen Hoover is always recommended and that is the reason I went on to buying multiple books of hers. I decided to start with Ugly Love to be officially introduced to her.

I loved Miles and Tate. I knew he endured grief in the past without it even being talked about at the beginning. I enjoyed seeing his and Tates relationship develop. Personally me I don't believe you can make someone fall in love with you. That is what Tate was doing from the beginning because she liked Miles head on at the beginning regardless of when they set there rules as.

But, I was happy to see him start to open up. However, I hated how he treated Tate at times because he would lead her on and then switch up. I do like that the both of then had ambition as well within there careers which reminds me of myself 🤩.

I can say I wasn't fond of the way Miles chapters were written. It was a poem to a certain extent and I understand what Collen was doing I just wasn't that big on the structure. It was amazing to see his background and what broke him. Not to mention to see a hero in the book let out his emotions was astonishing because men are always taught to be strong and hold everything in. Miles did it, but was finally able to let it go. That is why I was happy for him at the end to find love with Tate and become a father for the second time.

I give the book a 4.5/5 for reasons known. It was great chemistry between the charaters, a good plot, and represented grief well. But, I had issues with the pace of the book and at times the relationship forming between Miles and Tate. That was really about it.

I recommended anybody to read this book! It was great and I look forward to now reading other books by Colleen 🤗.",positive

167,Audible Books & Originals,Ugly Love,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Okay, wow wow wow.

First of all, the way that @colleenhoover illustrated Miles's happiness through the literal layout of the words on the pages was so remarkable and unique. It made the end that much more fulfilling (spoiler? but is it?)

Based on the description of the book, I went into this thinking it was going to be a spicy, light-hearted, friends-to-lovers type of romance. I did not expect the level of depth and heartache.

Tate's experience prioritizing time spent with Miles over her own desires and boundaries was so relatable - I wish I would have read this in my early 20s. There were slight hints of Lily from It Ends With Us, but not at all as dark or heavy. Miles - man. I definitely crushed on Miles. Well done, CoHo, well done.",positive
168,Audible Books & Originals,Ugly Love,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Damn this story was so emotional. I felt SO many things while reading this. There were things I loved but also things I didn’t like about this book. One thing for certain was that I couldn’t put it down and now that I’ve finished this, I’m really attached to this couple lol. I feel like I’ve been through the wringer with them.

I loved Tate so much, but for so much of this book I wanted her to find someone who would love and cherish her the way she deserved. The chemistry between her and Miles and the intensity of their relationship was brilliantly written. But the way he kept breaking her heart made me want her to find someone else so badly. But I was riveted by the dynamic between these two-so much that I could not stop reading.

The thing I did not like so much about this book was the amount of time dedicated to Mile’s backstory and describing his love and infatuation for his “first love” Rachel. I know this part of his history is important to the story, but I felt it was just too much. Every other chapter (although these chapters were brief) was about how deeply he was in love with Rachel -almost to the point of obsession. This all leads to a horrific tragedy which tears him and Rachel apart. This is what brings him to his present situation of not being able to love again. And poor Tate bears the brunt of this.

The way it all plays out was gut wrenching and heartbreaking. The ending and conclusion was fantastically done. I don’t think I could have asked for a better ending.",positive

170,Audible Books & Originals,"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I love fantasy; ever since I was a kid, stories set in creative worlds featuring varied groups of characters fighting to save the world, overcome evil, or even resolve some political matter have always captivated me. As such, I've read many fantasy novels over the years...and doing so has made me notice a rather unfortunate trend: the genre as a whole often relies too heavily on the same cliches and plots, which makes many of the stories presented seem tired, predictable, and overdone. As a result of this, I decided to take a break from fantasy; one can only read the same story so many times before getting fed up. I started ""A Game of Thrones"" very tentatively, partially because of the all the hype around the series and partially due to my own wariness regarding fantasy novels. My fears were completely unfounded; ""A Game of Thrones"" is a breath of fresh air for the genre, and is easily one of the best books I've read in recent years. Spoilers follow.

The novel contains three story lines. The first and most heavily focused on is that of the Kingdom of Westeros, its political structure, the ruling family's potentially reputation-destroying secret, and the beginning of conflict after the king dies. The second plot is that of the Wall and the constant struggle of the Night Watch to defend Westeros against the wildlings and more sinister creatures that reside beyond the Kingdom's border. The third takes place away from Westeros and follows the story of Daenerys, the last of the Targaryen family, and the start of her rise to power. The first story is clearly the main plot, while the second and third receive a little less attention, yet are no less important to the overall story.

The story presented here isn't that which is typically found in your common fantasy fare. This is not a tale of sword and sorcery, wizards and heroes enacting the traditional yarn of Good versus Evil, or of an impoverished farm boy discovering that he comes from a lofty background and is destined for greatness. Instead, this is largely about politics and political intrigue with a dash of magic and the unknown thrown in to give the novel a unique flavour. Perhaps the most noticeable element of the plot when compared to other fantasy books is the lack of magic; it does exist in Martin's world and he indicates that it can be a very powerful force, yet its role in this particular book is very small. This makes the few instances where it does appear very significant. Martin has said that he based ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" on the War of the Roses, and as such, more attention is given to the politics and the crisis of succession when Westeros' king dies. This makes for a story that avoids the traditional fantasy cliches while still having a distinctly fantasy feel.

The primary focus may be on political intrigue, but the book is hardly boring or overly mired solely in scheming. With all this political conflict come battles, fights, beheadings, and conquest, and Martin writes all of them exceedingly well and believably. This is a very gritty world that Martin has created, and he certainly doesn't shy away from showing how brutal life can be for his characters. Both rape and violence are present and are portrayed in a much blunter, starker light than in most novels. If there is a battle, you will see characters suffer gruesome ends, and the spoils of conquest are not glossed over. Yet, the use of such elements doesn't come off as gratuitous nor do they seem unnecessary; instead, they serve to characterize the world in which the characters go about their lives. Indeed, this is a dangerous place with far-reaching consequences and risks. It certainly puts a darker spin on the plot, but as someone who quickly bores of overly optimistic characters and stories, this darker, grittier fantasy very much appeals to me and gives the book a certain edge that sets it apart from others.

Accompanying this dangerous, sometimes terrifying world is the idea that no one is safe...and that includes main characters. Martin doesn't hesitate to take characters you've grown close to throughout the book and run them through the wringer, sometimes going as far as to kill them off. One of the main point of view characters is beheaded toward the end of the book, not because he is a terrible person or because he is in some way marked as being a ""bad"" character. On the contrary, he's the most honest, reasonable character in the book, and it's his own honesty that leads to his demise. This is the point that makes you realize that ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" will pull no punches or give anyone immunity based solely on whether they are a positive or negative character, a primary character or a background character. When characters, regardless of their role in the story, enter into a conflict, whether it's physical in the form of a fight or battle or more complicated through scheming and deceit, you genuinely fear for their safety. While the traditional fantasy novel may put the main character through trials and hardships, you know he'll make it through in the end, but that's not the case here. The reader is always on edge, worrying for their favourite characters or rooting for the demise of their most hated, but you never know how it's really going to play out. It's a completely different reading experience from most books out there, putting a real sense of danger into the book's events and a feeling of suspense into the story.

Another standout aspect of ""A Game of Thrones"" is the world building. Martin has not only created an intriguing world of politics, kings, deceit, battles, conquest, magic, and gritty reality, he has done it in a masterful manner. It's become something of a pet peeve of mine when authors are so proud of the world they've built that they dump pages and pages of their world's landscape, history, government, culture, etc on the reader in the middle of the story; it's a heavy-handed, clunky way of developing the backdrop of a novel. Martin manages to keep his world richly detailed while avoiding info-dumping by slipping in brief descriptions of how Westeros works in dialogue or when the subject in question appears. He doesn't appear to be in a hurry to reveal everything and instead lets things unfold in their own time. He knows his world from front to back, and he knows when it is appropriate to explain something and when it isn't.

The character setup of ""A Game of Thrones"" is also pretty different. Instead of having one protagonist whose story is the focus of the book, we get 8 different characters that provide 8 unique points of view. The perspective switches in every chapter, so we often see one event thoroughly told from two or three different characters. This is a great way to keep the story from getting stale or repetitive, as all of the characters have a distinct voice or bias and no character ever receives two chapters back to back. On the downside, however, it can be a little frustrating to be enjoying the perspective of one character, only to turn the page and see that you'll be finishing the issue at hand through the eyes of a different figure. That aside, having 8 point of view characters works very well for the novel because it keeps each chapter fresh and allows the reader to thoroughly get to know multiple characters rather than just one.

What is particularly great about Martin's characters is, as I said above, that they're completely distinct. They're so well fleshed out and have so many realistic motivations, feelings, and actions that it could be easy to forget that they are fictional characters rather than real people. While some characters may seem to fall into a broad archetype of character, pretty much none of the characters can be summed up on one or two words. Equally as impressive, whether you'll like or dislike a character will be dependent on how well they or part of their personality resonates with you personally, instead of whether they are ""good"" or ""bad."" Even the characters that seem to be cast in a more negative light have positive personality traits that make them likable and relatable. It also seems that what one reader appreciates about one character, another reader may dislike. The characters in ""Game of Thrones"" are so well fleshed out and realized that they sometimes seem as realistic as flesh-and-blood people, and like real people, your reactions to and liking of the characters will be based almost entirely on their complex personalities.

The secondary and side characters also receive a lot of care. Although we don't get to know them as intimately as the point of view characters, we still often see enough of them to get a sense of who they are. There are a lot of side characters in the novel, with possibly hundreds of names being tossed around depending on whose point of view the chapter is told through...so you do have to pay attention to who is who. Most characters, however, appear fairly frequently and are distinct enough that it's easy to keep them straight. And those who aren't seen as often tend to come with a little reminder of who they are when they do show up. Even though there are a lot of secondary and side characters, they are given a lot of thought, making for a rich variety of figures to populate the novel's setting.

To reiterate what I mentioned earlier, no one is safe. This can make for some emotional reading when the characters are so unique and well thought out. It must always be remembered that anything can happen to the characters and any chapter could be their last. Characters can meet their end very quickly or very slowly, and there's really no way of predicting if a figure will survive or not.

As a side note, despite the length of ""A Game of Thrones,"" it is only the first book of a long series. This means that while this novel contains its own well-told story, it also does a lot of setting up for the overarching plot and leaves more questions than it answers at its conclusion. If you begin to read this series, you will likely become hooked on it and rush out to get the second book after you finish this one.

Overall, ""A Game of Thrones"" is one of the best books I've read in recent years. It bucks the trends and cliches of modern fantasy novels and offers up something that is unique, but still contains the mystical flavour of the genre. The world presented is violent and gritty with a no-one-is-safe policy that leads for some edgy, often tense reading. The characters are wonderfully developed and fleshed out so well that they could easily be real people, and the different points of view throughout the novel offer unique perspectives on the story's events. This is perhaps the first book I've read in a long time about which I can't come up with something I don't like, aside from a couple characters...but, as I said earlier, not liking certain characters for aspects of their complex personalities is part of what makes the novel so, well, likeable. Five stars happily given for the above and for reviving my interest in fantasy.",positive
171,Audible Books & Originals,"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"First off, I'm a heavy duty fan of GRRM. I've read over a 100 different fantasy authors in my time (started at 12; I'm now 32). Took about 5 years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic and cliched.
So, when I came back to fantasy at the end of 1999, I read the usual: Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then someone told me about GRRM and man, that was the kicker!
Here are the reasons to choose GRRM. I've also listed the reasons not to choose him to make it fair b/c I know their are certain personalities who won't like this series:
WHY TO READ GRRM
(1) YOU ARE TIRED OF FORMULAIC FANTASY: good lad beats the dark lord against impossible odds; boy is the epitome of good; he and all his friends never die even though they go through great dangers . . . the good and noble king; the beautiful princess who falls in love with the commoner boy even though their stations are drastically different . . . you get the idea. After reading this over and over, it gets old.
(2) YOU ARE TIRED OF ALL THE HEROES STAYING ALIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDER CONSTANT DANGER: this gets even worse where the author kills a main hero off but that person comes back later in the story. Or, a hero does die but magic brings him back.
This sometimes carries to minor characters where even they may not die, but most fantasy authors like to kill them off to show that some risked the adventure and perished.
(3) YOU ARE A MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFF: this story was influenced by the WARS OF THE ROSES and THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR.
(4) YOU LOVE SERIOUS INTRIGUE WITHOUT STUPID OPPONENTS: lots of layering; lots of intrigue; lots of clever players in the game of thrones. Unlike other fantasy novels, one side, usually the villain, is stupid or not too bright.
(5) YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BIASED OPINIONS AND DIFFERENT TRUTHS: GRRM has set this up where each chapter has the title of one character and the whole chapter is through their viewpoint. Interesting tidbit is that you get their perception of events or truths. But, if you pay attention, someone else will mention a different angle of truth in the story that we rarely see in other novels. Lastly and most importantly, GRRM doesn't try to tell us which person is right in their perception. He purposelly leaves it vague so that we are kept guessing.
(6) LEGENDS: some of the most interesting characters are those who are long gone or dead. We never get the entire story but only bits and pieces; something that other fantasy authors could learn from to heighten suspense. Additionally, b/c the points of views are not congruent, we sometimes get different opinions.
(7) WORDPLAY: if you're big on metaphors and description, GRRM is your guy. Almost flawless flow.
(8) LOTS OF CONFLICT: all types, too; not just fighting but between characters through threats and intrigue.
(9) MULTILAYERED PLOTTING; SUB PLOTS GALORE: each character has their own separate storyline; especially as the story continues and everyone gets scattered. This is one of the reasons why each novel is between 700-900 pages.
(10) SUPERLATIVE VARIED CHARACTERS: not the typical archetypes that we are used to in most fantasy; some are gritty; few are totally evil or good; GRRM does a great job of changing our opinions of characters as the series progress. This is especially true of Jaime in book three.
(11) REALISTIC MEDIEVAL DIALOGUE: not to the point that we can't understand it but well done.
(12) HEAPS OF SYMOBLISM AND PROPHECY: if you're big on that.
(13) EXCELLENT MYSTERIES: very hard to figure out the culprits; GRRM must have read a lot of mystery novels.
(14) RICHLY TEXTURED FEMALE CHARACTERS: best male author on female characters I have read; realistic on how women think, too.
(15) LOW MAGIC WORLD: magic is low key; not over the top so heroes can't get out of jams with it.
REASON TO NOT READ GRRM
(1) YOU LIKE YOUR MAIN CHARACTERS: GRRM does a good job of creating more likeable characters after a few die. But, if that isn't your style, you shouldn't be reading it. He kills off several, not just one, so be warned.
(2) DO NOT CARE FOR GRITTY GRAY CHARACTERS: if you like more white and gray characters, this may unsettle you. I suggest Feist or Goodkind or Dragonlance if you want a more straight forward story with strong archetypes.
(3) MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEWS TURN YOU OFF: if you prefer that the POVS only go to a few characters, this might be confusing for you.
(4) SWEARING, SEX: there's a lot of it in this book just as there is in real life.
(5) YOU DEMAND CLOSURE AT THE END OF EVERY BOOK: this isn't the case for all stories in the series. Some are still going on; some have been resolved; others have been created and are moving on.
(6) IF YOU WANT A TARGET OR SOMEONE TO BLAME: this can be done to some extent but not as much. This is b/c he doesn't try to make anyone necessarily good or evil.
(7) ARCHETYPES: some readers like archetypal characters because it's comfortable; we like the good young hero (sort of like Pug in Feist's THE RIFTWAR SAGA); it's familiar and we sometimes like to pretend we're this upcoming, great hero. You wont' get much of this in GRRM with the exception of one or two characters.
(8) LENGTH: you don't want to get into a long fantasy epic series. In that case, look for shorters works as this is biiig.
(9) PATRIARCHY: men are most of the main characters with lots of power (one female exception). ....",positive
172,Audible Books & Originals,"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I am writing this review as an individual who watched Game of Thrones on HBO before picking up the book series, so with that in mind you may or may not find my review helpful/useful. I will also try to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible.

As a fan of the tv series, I came into this book knowing what to expect; I was told that Season 1 and Book 1 are very similar, and that is most certainly true. But do you know what? I still loved the book. I’ll do list format for the book’s good and bad points (in my opinion and in no particular order) to make this a little more organized.

--
GOODS:

DIALOGUE/WRITING - George RR Martin has a way with words. His descriptions of the various locations and lands and kingdoms of Westeros, from Winterfell to King’s Landing to Vaes Dothrak, have flawless flow. I love descriptive writing, and there is always a fine line between not describing something enough to give the reader a good picture and going overboard to the point where it gets boring to read through paragraphs of superfluous text. This is especially true in the fantasy genre, where the lands and people and words and customs are all…well, fantastical. This book finds that balance, with evocative, beautiful language that puts you right in that setting and right in the thick of the action. Hell, the descriptions of food always made me hungry even if they were serving something that I would never actually eat! As for the dialogue, if you are a fan of the show’s dialogue, or clever dialogue in general, you will enjoy this book. There are a good number of memorable and poignant quotes throughout the book, my favorite being “When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die,” an apt summary for sure. Bottom line, when you pick up this book, be prepared to engross yourself and be swept away to a foreign land.

VOICES/POINTS OF VIEW - Notable about this book, and all the books in the series, is that it is constantly switching from various characters points of view (POVs, as I’ll refer to them from now on). And by various, I mean roughly 7-8 characters. As difficult as this is to pull off, Martin does a great job. It’s an effective way to see what is going on in multiple locations at roughly the same time while keeping us invested. I applaud his decision to present us the information this way as it gives us a greater connection with the characters and more insight into various situations as we see how they are impacting the character that we are viewing it through. Not to mention, Martin manages to keep each of the individual POVs unique enough that you don’t need to flip back to see who’s narrating. Each character has distinct personality traits and ways of thinking/speaking that distinguish them from the others. Sansa is lady-like, a romantic and naive. Arya is fiery, resourceful and a fighter. Tyrion is shrewd, astute and full of quick-witted jibes. And so on and so forth. It is also worth noting that each character, even if a few of them are in the same place at the same time, sees different things and different people and analyzes situations in different ways, so each chapter gives you new information in some way or another. It’s very cleverly done and just as frustrating when you realize “UGH this character doesn’t know what was revealed to me, the reader, in THIS CHARACTER’S chapter” which is a great way of keeping you hooked.

CHARACTERS: HEROES VS VILLAINS - Getting inside the characters heads, you start to understand their motives and the ways that they think. So you get to decide for yourself what motives are justified and who you believe in or who you’re rooting for. But then again, just because one character appears to be the “hero” of the story, doesn’t mean they’ll necessarily get a happy ending. If you’re looking for a feel-good story about about good conquering evil, this probably isn’t for you. If you’re looking for a story with deep, cunning characters who you can’t always trust, who are shades of grey versus black and white, then you’ll find this book a compelling read.

DEPTH - Martin has done his homework and has developed rich histories for each of the characters and their houses. Hell, the Appendix of the book has small blurbs about each house, its history, its sigil, its words/slogan and the relevant members of the house. It’s always available for you to flip back and read if you find yourself confused, which can happen. Having watched the tv series, I was less confused about the various Houses and characters coming into the book, which helped a lot. Yet I still found myself learning new information from the Appendix. It’s a great tool and shows the author’s dedication to his characters and their backgrounds. I was impressed by how richly developed everything was, even though this is only the first book in the series.

NO TEENAGE DIARY DESCRIPTIONS ABOUT SEX - This book has sex in it. Quite a bit, too. I can see how this would be off-putting to some readers. Personally, I don’t mind it much. What I appreciated was that the descriptions of sex weren’t long, drawn out, excessively pornographic or mushy-gushy. I appreciated not having to wade through pages upon pages of “his fingers brushed against my fingers and my heart fluttered, he looked at me and I admired his beautiful eyelashes” or other mushy teenage romance dialogues that frankly bore the poop out of me. On the other hand, you’re not reading through pages and pages of detailed erotica either. It’s written very matter-of-factly, very bluntly and to-the-point and only went into a bit more description when it was warranted. Again, I imagine this isn’t for everyone, so you may consider this a negative. The way it was presented throughout the book, however, I felt warranted a checkmark in the “Good” category.

FEMALE CHARACTERS - Some of the best depictions of female characters I have read. I was very impressed. The female characters are at all ends of the spectrum in this book, from feminine to tough to conniving. In a book where you’d assume the male characters take front and center, the female characters are just as fascinating, if not moreso in some cases.

X-RAY - I have the Kindle version of this book. The X-Ray features really helps you keep track of the book’s many characters and remind you who someone is if you forget, which is SUPER helpful. I used the features many times throughout the book and it definitely aided my understanding and allowed me to further appreciate the depth of the characters and the story.

--
BADS:

MULTIPLE POVs SLOW DOWN THE ACTION - The constant cutting back and forth between different characters and settings, while well done, also has the side effect of slowing down some of the action. You end a chapter on a cliffhanger as the one character’s POV learns something horrifying or experiences something shocking. But then the next chapter jumps to a character who is in a completely different setting and you have to wait until you get to a chapter of a character who is in place where the cliffhanger first happened. It slows down the action a bit, which can get a little frustrating. If it really bothers you to read a cliffhanger and then wait a few chapters to see a reaction or resolution to that cliffhanger, then this book might frustrate you more than entertain you. Not to mention, if you find one character’s voice/writing style/actions particularly boring, you might find it tiresome to have to wade through those chapters to get to the “good stuff.” I know I personally had that problem in a few instances.

TYPOS - I have the Kindle version of this book, and it had quite a number of typos. Not on every page or anything, but more than I would have liked. A few of them sort of interrupted the flow of the story while I was reading, but for the most part they aren’t a huge deal. Just a little annoying.

LENGTH - Not gonna lie, flipping through the Table of Contents and realizing there are 72 chapters was a little daunting. And if you have a really busy schedule, you might find the length a little scary too. I’m very glad I stuck it out and plowed through, though!

173,Audible Books & Originals,"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"If you're going to consider reading `The Song of Ice and Fire' series, then be prepared for an investment. These books aren't for casual readers, but rather slower and more methodical ones. Requiring a great deal of your time, attention to detail, and the memorization of various characters' political and social associations. The amount of content the book contains is equal to the level of commitment you are willing to give. This may sound intimidating to some people, but Games of Thrones is able to deliver a very deep story targeting a mature audience because of this, though this also means the book's level of comprehension and adult content may become a deal-breaker to some people. Persevere and you'll enjoy one of the best fantasy epics in quite some time.

As I previously said, the narrative of A Game of Thrones can be quite cumbersome to comprehend at the very beginning, and the faint synopsis doesn't exactly paint a very big picture of what's to come. So I've decided to provide a brief synopsis of my own.

With the murder of King Robert Baratheon's Hand `Jon Aryn', his Majesty himself has requested that his old friend Eddard Stark, head of House Stark take up the role at his side in King's Landing to help him properly govern the realm. Of course taking up this honorable task would mean Eddard, `Ned' must leave the sanctity of Winterfell and his family. But he soon realizes that treachery and deception have consumed the nobility, no one can be trusted, everyone is trying to seize power by any means necessary; particularly the cunning Lannister family. The book doesn't just follow the character Ned, but rather a large collection of personas, some intertwine with the central story arc involving Ned, others involve their own. Daenerys Targaryen, one of the last of the feared House Targaryen, is forced into a marriage with a savage Dothraki warlord in order to gain in army for the means of reconquering her rightful throne. The last major story arc involves Ned's bastard son `Jon Snow' and his indoctrination in the enigmatic `Night's Watch', where desertion is punishable by death.

While the plot of A Game of Thrones is truly an epic piece of fiction-writing, it would be nothing if the characters weren't believable. George R. R. Martin has established himself as a very strong character-driven author, one who focuses on the problems of these people and how they affect them. While there are characters which are not affiliated with Eddard Stark, the majority of the major characters can be allocated into the two major noble families: the Starks and the Lannisters. The Starks characterize honor, duty, diligence, and integrity, making them the primary protagonists. They're opposed by the ambitiously materialistic Lannister family, who seem like Martin's equivalent of the Borgia's. Though if there's a weakness in the characterization department, it would be that not enough is done with characterizing the Lannister family. The Stark family makes up the bulk of the story's protagonists, but they aren't exactly perfect. They can be rude, selfish, jealous, and even bratty at times, they're delightfully flawed characters. With the exception of the great character `Tyrion Lannister', we're given very little insight into the life of the family aside from their obvious immoral tendencies. The Lannisters, while morally vague, come off feeling much less defined. I really wish more could have been done with them when compared to the excellently characterized Stark family.

In a seemingly endless miasma of betrayal and deceit, the only beacon of hope comes in the form of family. The Starks, particularly the Stark children felt like the real heart of the book for me. Their precious innocence helps invest the reader in the story even further, especially since they're among the victims in this malicious game that the adults are playing. It only reinforces the insurmountable stakes and that nobody is truly safe or completely innocent.

Even the world itself feels like a character that helps ground the reader in the author's fiction. Martin's `Seven Kingdoms' are vividly brought to life with intricate detail that makes it really pop off the pages. Its geography, political structure, and the dominant noble houses are all elaborated upon in surreal detail that really gives the reader a feeling of place. Less reliance on more fantastical elements like elves and dwarves gives Martin's world a pinch of reality that most authors tend to avoid. With the exception of the `White Walkers' and the extinct dragons, all mystical aspects are kept at an all-time low, favoring words and steel over mysticism and spells. The outcome is a fantasy world that surprisingly, comes off as genuinely plausible. The Seven Kingdoms feels like a realm that very much could have existed. It's an interesting divergence from the typical high fantasy settings.

There's going to be the inevitable comparison between Martin's work and the legacy left behind by Tolkien as the great forefather of fantasy writing. The notion of comparing the two is entirely misguided, simply because Martin's writing is completely different from Tolkien's in nearly every angle. Tolkien emphasized the ongoing struggle between good and evil, the thrill of high adventure in a fantastical world, and the triumph of great heroes over terrible villains who would do the world harm. Martin on the other hand is much less black and white with his delivery. There are obvious characters you can label as `dishonorable', while others stand atop a pedestal as paragons of altruism. But are these characters truly evil for trying to secure the benefit of their family and future generations to come? And are these characters considered good if they're ensuring the stability of the realm by dishonest methods? Martin chose to forgo typical fantasy conventions of magic and obvious morality in the favor of characters who feel genuinely believable in all the most despicable ways. They're not the great heroes Tolkien illustrated; they're morally ambiguous human beings. That's the defining characteristic which separates these two giants of fantasy, the selfless heroes and the morally grey humans. Comparing these two juggernauts is completely irrelevant, for Martin isn't trying to replicate Tolkien but rather make his own beast.

Yet, I never like to jump on a bandwagon and proclaim with the rest of the world that a novel is absolutely perfect. Of course these critiques are personal ones and admittedly border on flat-out nitpicking. The first is the absolutely insane overabundance of minor characters. I'm not referring to the central characters that the various chapters shift between; they're all perfectly characterized and fascinating. I'm referring to the endless onslaught of characters that overcrowd the book, but serve little importance in the greater scheme of things. Every story arc is jam-packed with so many characters that range from semi-important to useless. I usually wouldn't mention this, but with a book of this magnitude it really became an issue with me, though it may not for other people. The second issue is the lack of a proper climax to the story. I'm all for having an intriguing plot over a mindless slog of action scenes, but with a book of this size, it would have been nice to have it end with a bang. It's little things like these that stand out when the rest of the book is just so good.

When Hollywood absolutely bastardized the final Harry Potter novel by splitting it into two movies in order to fill their glutinous craving for money; I became somewhat of a skeptic to segmenting visual adaptations of popular literature. Creating a television show made me raise an eyebrow, ""instead of making a movie they're going to milk it with a whole season of episodes"" I thought. After reading A Game of Thrones, I realized that making a television show out of the book isn't just a good idea, it's absolutely mandatory. This book and its sequels have so much content in them that a movie would never do the plot and its various characters justice. It's the perfect source material for an epic fantasy television series, which is great considering we don't exactly have many of those.

A Game of Thrones is the start of something special. The beginning chapter of an epic tale that needs to be read by everyone of age who can truly appreciate its complexity. Read the book first before you watch the show, only then can you truly appreciate George R. R. Martin's natural talent for weaving such incredible stories.",positive

A Song of Ice and Fire, by George R. R. Martin consists of:
1. A Game of Thrones (to be aired as the HBO series Game of Thrones on April 17, 2011)
2. A Clash of Kings
3. A Storm of Swords
4. A Feast for Crows
5. A Dance with Dragons (via Martin's ""Not a Blog"" LiveJournal, he has 3 POV chapters left to finish at the time of this writing.)
6. The Winds of Winter (forthcoming)
7. A Dream of Spring (forthcoming)

What's all the fuss?

This series is the progenitor of a new wave of literature which combines elements of epic fantasy, dark fantasy, and intellectual literary fiction. The idea was to create a true world (in all its color, grit, mystery, politics, realism and so on) through cultured prose, and yet still have all the elements of escapist fantasy; the idea was to create real people with real drama, and insert them into a fantastic reality; the idea was to reinvent the fantasy genre from cliché hack-and-slash/sword-and-sorcery to something original, passionate, and enthralling.

Martin succeeded in these goals, and inspired others to follow in a similar vein: The Malazan Book of the Fallen, The Kingkiller Chronicles, The Prince of Nothing, The Gentleman Bastard, The First Law, etc.

Why so good?

1. Exceptional writing: Martin is a literary master. His prose doesn't just ""work,"" it really inspires. His vocabulary is learned yet approachable. The text inserts me directly into this medieval kingdom. Imagery runs rampant with details galore. Just a very well written story.

2. Believable characters: Grey characters! Real, believable characters with unique dialogue, motivations, and reactions populate this entire series. Martin develops interesting personalities with his talent for voice. These characters come alive within just a few pages of reading their chapters. People change! What a concept!

3. Risk: This is a world of blades and steel, arrows and leather. People die in war. This is a story of politics, intrigue, and betrayal. People are assassinated. Main characters may serve as a central window into the chief plotline, but that certainly doesn't mean that they are safe from harm. Pain and death MEAN something, and Martin loves to make us feel.

4. History: Martin has spent years living in this world, and the history is so rich that the immersion is instant. It's almost disorienting. The details that he has planned out and the meticulousness of the layers within the story are so natural that you cannot help but be in awe.

5. Tactful use of fantasy elements: No ""magic missile"" spells or ""jelly-legs"" jinxes here. There are strong fantasy elements, but they are used in tactful, and oftentimes subtle, ways. The supernatural is seen as superstition by most of the characters in the story, and so when something akin to ""magic"" does show up, it is unique and potent.

6. Details matter: Watch the description of a character, even if you don't know the character's name; they'll show up later. Actually think about what people say; you may be able to find out the answer to a question far before the characters do. Dreams and prophecies may be vague, but they are actually vital! Martin has also acknowledged his use of the unreliable narrator (in fact, he has to use it, in order to make the POV chapters believable); find the inconsistencies between what happens and what characters think, and see the story from a different perspective!

7. Engaging plot: All three main plotlines are exotic and entertaining: the fight for power over Westeros' throne, the exile of the last Targaryen queen, and the threat of the Others in the north. Filled with cliffhangers chapter after chapter, mysteries that need solving, epic moments of badassery, horrible moments of dread, cool one-liners and philosophical quotes, raunchy sex, and violent death, the story is brimming with awesome.

Why doesn't everyone like this series, then?

Virtually every one- or two-star review I have seen (amazon, goodreads, etc.) can be boiled down to one of three categories:
1. ""The Fantasy Lover"" (a.k.a. ""Sex is Nasty"" Syndrome)
a. ""Ew, it's so gross and disgusting and tragic and there's so much sex and violence and swearing! Where is my damsel being rescued by the handsome, heroic prince? Why do people die? I felt like `washing in industrial cleanser' to get this filth away from me! Fantasy should only be about romantic ideals and have nothing to do with reality... and the good guys should always win!""
b. To you, I say, stop being such a prude. The writing is excellent and appropriate to its content, and the idea is to explore the connection between fantasy and reality. Fantasy does not have an ""end purpose"" in mind, and you are simply being obstinate about originality and progress. People are not black and white and neither is life; people die, and people are maimed, and people have sex, and people go to the bathroom, and people are raped, and sometimes, the `bad guys' win; however, I think escapist fantasy may be even MORE engaging when combined with those aspects of reality... and that is an opinion enjoyed by millions of people.

2. ""The Whiner"" (a.k.a. ""The Author is My Bitch"" Syndrome)
a. ""It's been five years since the last book, and Martin is fat and old, and he has his fingers in so many pies, and he doesn't care about the series anymore, and he's just trying to milk it, and why can't he finish it already, and I could have the next book written by now, and and and and and....""
b. To you, I say, no, the author is not your slave. Your buying his books did not indenture him into servitude, nor did it oblige a contract. He writes when he writes, and you read when he's done. Complaining about it [timing, his other projects, etc.] makes you look pathetic, silly, and a tad bit unstable. It's like trying to intimidate a world-renowned TV chef to finish his/her magnum opus because you just want lunch on your TV tray, damnit! How full of yourself do you have to be?
c. Also, the books do not deserve a one star rating simply because they aren't coming out as fast as you want.

3. ""The Pragmatist"" (a.k.a. ""But Reading Takes So Much Time!"" Syndrome)
a. ""The first book is 800 pages, and they just get longer from there; there's no end in sight for the series and no single book tells a full story; there's too much exposition with too much `backstory'; the plot is so slow!""
b. To you, I say... well, this might actually be a valid concern for some people. The story IS huge... but in case you didn't see the genre description, it is EPIC fantasy, and Martin has himself described it as having a ""cast of thousands."" The advantages of longer books are that characters can develop into fully fleshed out beings and that a fictional world can become, in some part, real. It's also a huge story in terms of scope - the synopsis states it simply enough: ""...where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime....""

Minor Spoilers on Individual Books:

A Game of Thrones
A brilliant first book, this begins each of the three main plots. For the first plot, the main house we deal with here is the Starks, the house ""in charge"" of the North. For the second plot, we are introduced to the naiveté of Daenerys (Duh-NAIR-iss) and for the third, we get to see the shabby condition of the Night's Watch. Though each plot develops independently, it is easy to see how they interconnect. The characters really drive this piece, and it is a true trip for anyone, new or old, to the genre. A 5 star book if there ever was one.

Obliviously, I not only recommend this specific book, but the entire series. All the best, and happy reading!",positive
175,Audible Books & Originals,"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"A long journey with no end in sight. I'll try to avoid much plot beyond was it needed to be mentioned and focus more on the strengths and failings of each book.

The first of a planned trilogy turned two trilogies turned to seven, possibly eight books, A Game of Thrones begins as one story but ends somewhere else entirely. Following the usurping of the ""mad king"" King Robert Baratheon has sits upon the Iron Throne uncomfortably (as if there was any other way to sit upon a seat made entirely of swords melted together) caring more to hunt, whore and drink than rule. His wife, unbeknown to him, has birthed three children with her own brother and claimed them as Robert's. When his Hand (either the Hand speaks with the voice of the King, or, the King s***s and the Hand wipes) dies suddenly he heads north to Winterfell to induct his childhood friend and partner in rebellion, Neddard Stark to take the position.

Soon the Stark family is divided, Ned's Bastard is sent to The Wall, a massive 700 foot high block of ice that damns the north from the rest of Westeros, as his wife will not have him around without Ned and he can't take him with to court. The two youngest children stay behind while Ned takes his eldest son and two daughters (the older of whom is to marry Robert's heir, Joffery) to Kings Landing to rule.

Soon it is obvious that Robert's wife Cerci has plotted to kill Robert, take Ned stark, claim the thrown for her incest born son and rule as Queen until he comes of age. This is when the story takes flight.

Though it seems to start as a tale of ""winter coming"" (winter being less a season and more like a minor ice-age that hits every other generation or so and my last for years or decades) it quickly turns into a power struggle pulling all the lands off all the world in.

We also meet Danny, the youngest daughter of the ""Mad King"" whose brother attempts to sell her as a wife to gain an army of horse lords to take back the Iron Throne. This ends poorly for the conceded fool, but Danny learns she has the true blood-of-the-dragons in her, she cannot be burned by fire and by the end of the book she has hatched three baby dragons from believed fossilized eggs.

Elsewhere Robert's brothers Renly and Stannis each prepare to claim the throne as word of Joffery's bastard status is spread, as well Robb Stark, the eldest son calls his father's bannermen to lead an assault against the Lannisters. Which leads us to the next novel.

In A Clash of Kings, Martin tells the story of the war of the seven kingdoms. It seems every lord wants to proclaim himself king (new ones pop up every day, it is noted) and they are both marching on Kings Landing, and against each other.

It's here that one of the strongest characters, Tyrion Lannister, twins Cerci and Jamie's younger sibling, a dwarf despised by his family and hated by his father for ""killing"" his mother when he came into the world. Tyrion is well read and educated and early on unaware of the incest between his twin siblings. After being accused in the first book of trying to kill one of the Stark sons, Tyrion has bought his way home with a sellsword and wildlings under his employ and upon finding his father in battle against Robb, is sent to Kings Landing to be Hand to Joffery. Here we see how smart Tyrion is as he outwits both his sister and Stannis at every turn and ultimately saves them all from invasion and secures Joffery's throne a bit longer.

Unlike Game of Thrones, Clash of Kings tells a less character driven story. Many new characters and locations are introduced, which, on first reading can be confusing. Though the first book would have you think the Starks are the focus of these books, you find out fast that anyone can die and there's no clear option for who the reader should perceive as good or bad, or even the better of all other options. As well it seems like Danny has been left with little to do but wonder the dessert, plot revenge, raise her dragons and suffer.

A Storm of Swords may easily be the best book of the series. Bracing, swift and epic (one of the longest of the series at over 1000 pages) it focuses almost squarely on the central characters, advances the plot lines in a satisfying manner and sweeps you into the one real page turning of the series.

Sansa Stark has been un-betrothed to the bastard king Joffery, who is to marry of all people, Renly's widow (a supposed 16 yr old virgin widow.) However, Sansa is swiftly and forcibly (for both) wed to Tyrion the imp, no with half a nose and a full face scar from battle. Tyrion has never seemed to have it out for the Starks like his Sister and Father and is actually as kind to the stiff and horrified Sansa (not quite 13 years old) until they are both accused of murder. Sansa his whisked away by her Aunts new husband and assumes the role of his bastard daughter to hide. Tyrion is locked up and condemned.

Meanwhile Robb Stark learns a hard lesson about breaking vows and he and his mother suffer dearly. Arya, the youngest sister has been captured for ransom, Jon Snow lives and returns from behind the wall with the wildings only to be stuck trying not to take sides in the war as Stannis comes to the aid of the wall and demands to be treated like King even though he's yet to claim the throne. Danny buys 8000 slave warriors trading one of her dragons, then turns them on there masters, sacks the city and heads out to build her army and free slaves on her way to Kings Landing to take back the throne.

Which all leads to the low-point of the series, A Feast for Crows... exactly what we, the readers, may feel we got. Not to say that it's all bad, just a poor choice in publishing. Crows is actually only half of the novel, the other half is the first half of A Dance with Dragons. Confused? Due to length issues Martin took have the character chapters and put them in Feast and saved the other half of the chapters for Dance, but didn't publish them together. Instead he doubled the length of Dance over five years, having the events of that novel and Feast meet in the middle and then run congruent again for the second half.

The result is Feast is almost entirely the story of Kings Landing and the Lannisters with a few chapters on Greyjoy's and Arya and little else. Then in Dance you get the same time frame, but every-one elses stories. Some of it is not only redundant information including sections of chapters reprinted verbatim. In one case a character you know dies in Feast, has several chapters in Dance as the congruent story lines would have him still alive at the early points in the book.

A Game of Thrones (could be titled La Morte D'Eddard) is a strong opening novel about the misfortunes that befall the Stark family which sets up the great war which is the framing for the other books to come.

A Clash of Kings: An epic but often impersonal war story saved by the tales of Tyrion Lannister as he serves as Hand to the King and chief outwiter of his wicked sister, Cerci. Many new characters and locations can make the book a bit hard to follow but the set-up brings us...

A Storm of Swords: The series high point, epic and moving, it fleshes out characters in events in a meaningful way and draws the reader into a real page-turner.

At this point there is clear divide in the structure and writing. Martin begins to write a moment by moment of every character, never does he seem to be able to say, ""A few weeks later"" instead we must get every detail of every moment of everyday. I skipped entire pages of prose with Martin rambling on and on without progressing story or developing character.

A Feast for Crows: This half-entry in the series can drag miles long, completely ignoring the major plot lines of Jon Snow, Danney and Tyrion it leaves us almost entirely at the hands of the Lannisters.

A Dance with Dragons: Finally some life back into the series, tells the events of the characters left out of Feast but sometimes rehashing already known information or lacking suspense as Feast provided spoilers for Dance. Martin sets us up to endure the long winter at last.",positive
176,Audible Books & Originals,"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I finished reading Game of Thrones this morning and I thought a review of the book was in order, despite having mentioned it already on several occasions. Be warned there are spoilers present! So without further delay, here is how George R. R. Martin made me into a fan of epic fantasy:

1. He altered my preconceived notions of what an epic fantasy is supposed to be. In my head, all epic fantasy was simply a retelling of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. It all contained elves and wizards and dragons. Magic played a big role. Ambitious quests were the order of the day. And it was almost always good versus evil. Game of Thrones broke all the rules in this respect. The ""dwarf"" was so through a birth defect. There were no wizards. While magic was hinted at, we see almost none in the book. There were no quests. Nor was there a clear good or evil. (Joffrey seems evil, but he's really just a kid trying to be a man.) From the moment I started reading the book, it was not at all what I expected. And that was refreshing.

2. His characters were among the most complex people I've come across in science fiction and fantasy (Connie Willis has equally complex characters in her novels.) These are not characters who necessarily behave the way their position dictates. A fighter isn't always brave. A lady isn't always meek. An old man isn't always wise and a young boy isn't always a child. The burdens of the leaders of men weigh heavily upon them and that comes through in the book. By the end of the book, I began to feel like I knew some of the characters so well that I could guess at their reactions to a situation and be pleased to find that I was usually right. They feel like friends to me, not caricatures.

3. His world-building is masterful without being intrusive. There is enough of the world and its background to give you a good understanding of the time and place of the events, without taking you out of the story. And yet, there is enough hinted at but not said to leave you wondering. For instance: how on Earth did they build that wall? The society is a complex one (after all, it is a melding of seven kingdoms, each with its own rich history) but it is presented clearly in the narrative at times and places that are appropriate to the story. Unlike Tolkien, Martin doesn't step out of the story to give a lengthy history (except, perhaps, once toward the end of the book when Bran is learning about the early days of his people). The laws in this universe are self-consistent and add value to the story as a whole.

4. He makes you forget you are reading epic fantasy. Instead, from almost the very beginning, you feel like you are integrated into the lives of people in a world that is different from our own, but still recognizable. That there are tropes of epic fantasy becomes incidental. What matters is the story, the characters, and how it all plays out. I think the same is true of Connie Willis' Blackout/All Clear and it is a rare writer that can make you forget the genre in which you are reading, but fall so deeply into a story as to feel as if you've become part of it.

5. He dangles the magic just far enough of your reach to make its effect all the more worthwhile. I call this the Superman-effect. Whenever I watch various incarnations of Superman, I am always looking forward to when and how he will use his powers. But in skilled story-telling, it is few and far-between, even though we want to see it more. Martin hints at powers both great and terrible throughout the novel. There are the direwolves, the Stark's have taken. There is something special about them. There was Bran's remarkable dream during his coma. But really, we only see a remarkable display of magic or effect in two places: first when the wight's attack Jon and the Lord Commander in Castle Black on the Wall. And later, at the very end of the novel when the three dragons are born in a remarkable funeral pyre. Such judicious use of magic, sprinkled tantalizingly throughout the novel but coated thickly only twice had a profound effect on me as a reader.

6. He spins a remarkable tale. There was not a single point in the book where I thought to myself, this is getting a little slow; I really wish I could skip on and find out about so-and-so. Each time I thought it might happen (usually in scenes from Sansa's point of view) I found to my surprise that I was captured by the story being told, by the subplots unfolding, and by the vast tapestry being laid out before me. More often than not, I had to force myself to stop reading or I would have trouble getting up for work the next morning.
He tells a gritty story with an honesty I haven't seen much of in science fiction and fantasy. The grittiness of the world is part of what attracted me to it. These were not tales involving the angelic elves of Rivendell. These were tales of men at war, men who were greedy and rapacious. These were tales of women who were cruel. These were tales of men who strove for honor but didn't always live up to the name. In short these were the tales of ourselves as we really and truly are, not saints, not sinners, but somewhere in that vast purgatory in between. James Morrow in his novel Only Begotten Daughter, as well as in his Godhead Trilogy, is the only one who comes to mind at telling so brutal and honest a tale.

7. He isn't afraid to take risks, up to and including killing off major characters. It was one thing to see Sansa's direwolf, Lady, to be killed by Ned at the order of the King. It was quite another to see Eddard Stark beheaded after living his life for 8/10th of the book. It was almost as difficult to see Khal Drogo's demise, sad and pathetic as it was. Or King Robert's for that matter. It was difficult to see Bran paralyzed, Sansa abused by Joffrey, and Arya begging in the streets. Difficult: but that is life. Nothing can be counted on by yourself in this world that Martin has created and for the reader, that means that no one person is special, despite what they might think of themselves. It leaves plenty of room for surprise and emotion.

Even the most perfect story can't please everyone 100%. If there were any minor flaws in the story, there are two that I would call to attention:

1. I felt that the phrase ""play this game of thrones"" was used a little too much. At least, it stood out to me more than any other phrase in the book. Even ""Winter is coming"" was tempered and used to elevate the mystery of these long winters. But hearing the phrase ""game of thrones"" repeated again and again by the various players didn't ring true to my ears. Once or twice, maybe, but beyond that it felt like the reader was being beat over the head with it.

2. I can only imagine the frustration of the reader who read this book hot off the presses-only to find so many loose-ends untied, with the story ending essentially at a climax-and perhaps with no idea when or if there would be a sequel. In my case, at least, I was able to downloadA Clash of Kings to my Kindle the moment I finished reading Game of Thrones.

I rarely give out a 5-star review and if you look at novels I've ranked with 5-stars, you'll find that it is a very select class. But Game of Thrones has now joined them. And I'm so glad there are more books to discover in this world.

(This review originally appeared on my website: [...])",positive
177,Audible Books & Originals,"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"It's been ages since I originally purchased this book on my Kindle. I saw the size of the book and when I got my Kindle it was one of the first purchases I made. I figured it would be better to carry it on that slim device than to lug around the rather large book. I wanted to read the book prior to the premier of the show but... well that didn't happen. So my goal shifted; I wanted to read the first book before the second season began and that also didn't happen. Well, I gave it a try at least. I began reading this book in April just after I moved to Virginia and didn't have a job. I would spend my mornings putting out job applications and then by late afternoon I'd sit back and read a little. But the size of this book overwhelmed me, not that I haven't read anything of this size before, but for some reason the slow moving percentage on my Kindle wasn't being very helpful. Then I got my temp job and this book was put down.

Back and forth over the past five months I went. I would read a new book, put it down, then read 50 pages of Game of Thrones. Not only that but with trying to maintain a regularly updated book blog with ramblings about books I've read it's hard to just guarantee a number of days to read this huge book. However, I finished a book and went back to GoT for my few chapter read through and realized I was actually pretty darn close to being finished. Only, like, 200 pages left! So I read it in a flash and loved every moment of it then sat back and wondered why I hadn't just read it in one go to begin with.

Nonetheless, let's talk about the book for the very few people out there who haven't read it. Because, it seems, I am the last person in the world who got around to starting this series. If you've seen the show it's a lot like the book; they did a very good job at portraying the characters and many of the scenes in my opinion. Still, this book is long so obviously it has much more detail and scenery than the show does. If you've seen the show but have not read the book I'd suggest doing so!

While I wasn't keen on carrying around a copy of the book because it was so large I do wish, in a way, that I had that opportunity so that I could flip back and forth between the maps and family trees. It would have helped as the cast of the book is huge and the families are very wide spread and detailed. I have forever had issues of remembering people's names, book characters included, and had it not been for the fact that I had already watched the tv show and had faces to place with the names I probably would have been more lost as to who was who and how they were connected.

The story is good, the imagery is good, the description is good. This book is good. If you have a fascination with anything remotely like Tudor history, Arthurian legend or the long, detailed writing in Lord of the Rings then A Song of Ice and Fire is perfect for you. Dragons, princesses, secrets and swords fill its pages and often times left my head spinning. This book has a touch of fantasy but it doesn't go overboard. You aren't stuck feeling like you just slipped into the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy or Hogwarts. It's slipped in so casually that you find yourself, whilst reading the book, to just accept what they are speaking of and not think twice about if dragons exist or the dead can rise and kill.

Martin may put a little too much emphasis into certain details but I suspect they all come around to meaning something and he certainly helps you to picture the world he has created. It reads like some fantastic part of history yet the characters are certainly living and breathing at your ear, over your shoulder, while you go from page to page. Often times I'll read books by authors who have long since left this earth and I'm left feeling melancholy. ""Why don't people write like this anymore? Why don't they put detail into their books and write so beautifully?"" and I think I've discovered that there are authors who write in such ways and Martin is one of them. It's refreshing to be able to read a book so beautifully written and with such perfect detail that is current and published within my lifetime. Could it have been shortened down at some points? Certainly. Every other chapter I found at least a few pages that I could have gone without but what are you going to do? It's not like I didn't already know this was going to be a long book when I began it.

It does have its fair share of sex scenes, incest, and rape so be forewarned of that those of you who like to avoid such plot. But it's relevant to the story, or so it seems... most of the time, so it's kind of worth talking about. Martin leaves a lot of tidbits of information through out the book which you can pick apart in your own time and wonder what it all could mean. Apparently, it's a Thing fans of the series like to do and I can understand why they would when it spans such long periods of time between publications of books. In that regard, I'm glad I waited to pick up the books so that I won't have to wait forever for each book to come out. Granted, when A Song of Ice and Fire was first published I was ten and this was way beyond my reading comprehension but at least now I can take my time, play catch up, and maybe once I'm completely caught up with the books I can join the countless others who eagerly await the next book in the series.

I think what I liked best about the books was that the characters grow and change while you read. Often times you are able to witness how the surrounding events will alter a person or you are simply given privy to details otherwise unnoticed. I started the book with a dead set group of characters whom I liked and ones I disliked but by the end of the book that list had shuffled a little bit. Some of the characters I disliked at first (Sansa, for example) I had begun to like a little more by the end. While I have many other books I have to get through before I start A Clash of Kings I will be happy when I have that opportunity and look forward to it. There are many people out there who love this book and consider it a work of art, the best thing they had ever read, and swear by it. There are others who refuse to speak nothing but negative things about the book - it just did not work for them. For me, I liked it, I enjoyed it, and while I may not be standing on my office's roof proclaiming to the people waiting for their lunches that they must read this book - I still will quietly refer friends to it who are looking for a good tale.",positive

179,Audible Books & Originals,"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I was recommended this book by a friend who said it would be like Tolkien's adventures. However, since I have heard this comparison so often now, I maybe should start my praise by explaining why this book is TOTALLY DIFFERENT from anything J. R. R. Tolkien has ever written. In fact, the only thing Tolkien has in common with this are the presence of strong characters, a somewhat medieval setting, and that a vast and epic world is described. But these are pretty much hallmarks of much of the fantasy genre in general and can hardly be used to distinguish authors. Unlike ""the Lord of the Rings"", ""The Hobbit"", or ""The Children of Húrin"" for that matter, the world of ""A Game of Thrones"" depends much less on magic. Yes, the world that is described contained dragons long ago, but they are gone now. There is talk of giants, but nobody has ever seen them and they may be only rumours. There may be ""The Others"", but again it is unclear whether they really exist or still have any power and they are mostly referred to in curses, much the same way we would say ""To hell with you"" not knowing whether a hell actually exists. The main characters are all clearly human, look human, behave as humans, have human flaws and human strengths. Unlike in Tolkien's books there are no prominent wizards, hobbits, orks, elves, dwarfs, or demons dominating the story line. Secondly, the characters in ""A Game of Thrones"" are neither perfect heroes nor evil to the bone villains. Everybody has their understandable motives and behaves logically from their perspective, although, of course, the goals and ends of the various characters clash causing the wars and conflicts and intrigues to happen that make the book so captivating to read. Unlike Tolkien's adventures, ""A Game of Thrones"" is not about the battle between good and evil, black and white, light and darkness. This makes the whole storyline appear enormously realistic, as the world here is so much more like our own. Also the language is totally different between Tolkien's stories and this book. Whereas Tolkien uses his beautiful poetic language, George R. R. Martin is extremely blunt. Some of the words he uses, I have never seen in a printed book, and if I were to repeat them here in this review, I am sure Amazon would be deleting my entire text. Also the description of cruelty, rape, and war is very graphic in this book. Again, this makes it much more a realistic book, as in our own world these things are (unfortunately) much more common than selfless knights singing poems to their beloved elven girlfriend. However, also ""A Game of Thrones"" plays extensively with language, even though in a very different, more subtle way than Tolkien did. For instance, the names of the characters are often slightly modified variants of existing names (Petyr instead of Peter, Catelyn instead of Catherine, Eddard instead of Edward etc.) and many terms that are used are either invented or ancient versions of existing words (mayhaps instead of perhaps, import instead of importance, turncloak instead of turncoat etc.). This gives the text an interesting effect, providing us with a warm familiarity with the world on the one hand (we often feel at home here), while at the same time we appear to be in a strange, different place. What I, personally, also like is the way how the story is told. The many chapters are rather short but always told from the perspective of a particular main character. Therefore, the reader understands their motives, understands what is driving them to do or not do whatever they are doing, understands why they love or hate or despise other characters and how this influences their actions. And because the perspective out of which the story is told constantly changes, there is no ""absolute truth"", no ""right angle"", no ""good and evil""; only competing interests of all too human players. I will not mention details from the book as I do not want to spoil anyone's fun who has not read it yet. But I will say so much that George R. R. Martin has no problem killing off beloved characters. And unlike in Tolkien's books, dead characters do not come back to life (""Hello Gandalf""). Also this introduces a grim reality into the story. Playing the game of thrones can be deadly.

To me this was the best fantasy story I have read in a long time. I have already started the second book (also great!) and there will be at least five more to come. Given the writing style and the type of story, ""A Game of Thrones"" reads much more like the historical novels from Bernard Cornwell than anything Tolkien has ever written. Which is not to say that Tolkien is not great. I love Tolkien's books (!) but they are very different and I feel the customer should know this before the purchase, particularly as this comparison is made again and again and again for reasons I do not understand. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who likes good fantasy with deep non-stereotypic characters, sad (sometimes really sad!) turns in the story, and a realistic (sometimes too realistic) world with all the cruelties of war, battle, and conquest. Amazon limits me to give a maximum of five stars. I would rather like to give six, seven, or hundred.",positive
180,Audible Books & Originals,"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I love fantasy; ever since I was a kid, stories set in creative worlds featuring varied groups of characters fighting to save the world, overcome evil, or even resolve some political matter have always captivated me. As such, I've read many fantasy novels over the years...and doing so has made me notice a rather unfortunate trend: the genre as a whole often relies too heavily on the same cliches and plots, which makes many of the stories presented seem tired, predictable, and overdone. As a result of this, I decided to take a break from fantasy; one can only read the same story so many times before getting fed up. I started ""A Game of Thrones"" very tentatively, partially because of the all the hype around the series and partially due to my own wariness regarding fantasy novels. My fears were completely unfounded; ""A Game of Thrones"" is a breath of fresh air for the genre, and is easily one of the best books I've read in recent years. Spoilers follow.

The novel contains three story lines. The first and most heavily focused on is that of the Kingdom of Westeros, its political structure, the ruling family's potentially reputation-destroying secret, and the beginning of conflict after the king dies. The second plot is that of the Wall and the constant struggle of the Night Watch to defend Westeros against the wildlings and more sinister creatures that reside beyond the Kingdom's border. The third takes place away from Westeros and follows the story of Daenerys, the last of the Targaryen family, and the start of her rise to power. The first story is clearly the main plot, while the second and third receive a little less attention, yet are no less important to the overall story.

The story presented here isn't that which is typically found in your common fantasy fare. This is not a tale of sword and sorcery, wizards and heroes enacting the traditional yarn of Good versus Evil, or of an impoverished farm boy discovering that he comes from a lofty background and is destined for greatness. Instead, this is largely about politics and political intrigue with a dash of magic and the unknown thrown in to give the novel a unique flavour. Perhaps the most noticeable element of the plot when compared to other fantasy books is the lack of magic; it does exist in Martin's world and he indicates that it can be a very powerful force, yet its role in this particular book is very small. This makes the few instances where it does appear very significant. Martin has said that he based ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" on the War of the Roses, and as such, more attention is given to the politics and the crisis of succession when Westeros' king dies. This makes for a story that avoids the traditional fantasy cliches while still having a distinctly fantasy feel.

The primary focus may be on political intrigue, but the book is hardly boring or overly mired solely in scheming. With all this political conflict come battles, fights, beheadings, and conquest, and Martin writes all of them exceedingly well and believably. This is a very gritty world that Martin has created, and he certainly doesn't shy away from showing how brutal life can be for his characters. Both rape and violence are present and are portrayed in a much blunter, starker light than in most novels. If there is a battle, you will see characters suffer gruesome ends, and the spoils of conquest are not glossed over. Yet, the use of such elements doesn't come off as gratuitous nor do they seem unnecessary; instead, they serve to characterize the world in which the characters go about their lives. Indeed, this is a dangerous place with far-reaching consequences and risks. It certainly puts a darker spin on the plot, but as someone who quickly bores of overly optimistic characters and stories, this darker, grittier fantasy very much appeals to me and gives the book a certain edge that sets it apart from others.

Accompanying this dangerous, sometimes terrifying world is the idea that no one is safe...and that includes main characters. Martin doesn't hesitate to take characters you've grown close to throughout the book and run them through the wringer, sometimes going as far as to kill them off. One of the main point of view characters is beheaded toward the end of the book, not because he is a terrible person or because he is in some way marked as being a ""bad"" character. On the contrary, he's the most honest, reasonable character in the book, and it's his own honesty that leads to his demise. This is the point that makes you realize that ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" will pull no punches or give anyone immunity based solely on whether they are a positive or negative character, a primary character or a background character. When characters, regardless of their role in the story, enter into a conflict, whether it's physical in the form of a fight or battle or more complicated through scheming and deceit, you genuinely fear for their safety. While the traditional fantasy novel may put the main character through trials and hardships, you know he'll make it through in the end, but that's not the case here. The reader is always on edge, worrying for their favourite characters or rooting for the demise of their most hated, but you never know how it's really going to play out. It's a completely different reading experience from most books out there, putting a real sense of danger into the book's events and a feeling of suspense into the story.

Another standout aspect of ""A Game of Thrones"" is the world building. Martin has not only created an intriguing world of politics, kings, deceit, battles, conquest, magic, and gritty reality, he has done it in a masterful manner. It's become something of a pet peeve of mine when authors are so proud of the world they've built that they dump pages and pages of their world's landscape, history, government, culture, etc on the reader in the middle of the story; it's a heavy-handed, clunky way of developing the backdrop of a novel. Martin manages to keep his world richly detailed while avoiding info-dumping by slipping in brief descriptions of how Westeros works in dialogue or when the subject in question appears. He doesn't appear to be in a hurry to reveal everything and instead lets things unfold in their own time. He knows his world from front to back, and he knows when it is appropriate to explain something and when it isn't.

The character setup of ""A Game of Thrones"" is also pretty different. Instead of having one protagonist whose story is the focus of the book, we get 8 different characters that provide 8 unique points of view. The perspective switches in every chapter, so we often see one event thoroughly told from two or three different characters. This is a great way to keep the story from getting stale or repetitive, as all of the characters have a distinct voice or bias and no character ever receives two chapters back to back. On the downside, however, it can be a little frustrating to be enjoying the perspective of one character, only to turn the page and see that you'll be finishing the issue at hand through the eyes of a different figure. That aside, having 8 point of view characters works very well for the novel because it keeps each chapter fresh and allows the reader to thoroughly get to know multiple characters rather than just one.

What is particularly great about Martin's characters is, as I said above, that they're completely distinct. They're so well fleshed out and have so many realistic motivations, feelings, and actions that it could be easy to forget that they are fictional characters rather than real people. While some characters may seem to fall into a broad archetype of character, pretty much none of the characters can be summed up on one or two words. Equally as impressive, whether you'll like or dislike a character will be dependent on how well they or part of their personality resonates with you personally, instead of whether they are ""good"" or ""bad."" Even the characters that seem to be cast in a more negative light have positive personality traits that make them likable and relatable. It also seems that what one reader appreciates about one character, another reader may dislike. The characters in ""Game of Thrones"" are so well fleshed out and realized that they sometimes seem as realistic as flesh-and-blood people, and like real people, your reactions to and liking of the characters will be based almost entirely on their complex personalities.

The secondary and side characters also receive a lot of care. Although we don't get to know them as intimately as the point of view characters, we still often see enough of them to get a sense of who they are. There are a lot of side characters in the novel, with possibly hundreds of names being tossed around depending on whose point of view the chapter is told through...so you do have to pay attention to who is who. Most characters, however, appear fairly frequently and are distinct enough that it's easy to keep them straight. And those who aren't seen as often tend to come with a little reminder of who they are when they do show up. Even though there are a lot of secondary and side characters, they are given a lot of thought, making for a rich variety of figures to populate the novel's setting.

To reiterate what I mentioned earlier, no one is safe. This can make for some emotional reading when the characters are so unique and well thought out. It must always be remembered that anything can happen to the characters and any chapter could be their last. Characters can meet their end very quickly or very slowly, and there's really no way of predicting if a figure will survive or not.

As a side note, despite the length of ""A Game of Thrones,"" it is only the first book of a long series. This means that while this novel contains its own well-told story, it also does a lot of setting up for the overarching plot and leaves more questions than it answers at its conclusion. If you begin to read this series, you will likely become hooked on it and rush out to get the second book after you finish this one.

Overall, ""A Game of Thrones"" is one of the best books I've read in recent years. It bucks the trends and cliches of modern fantasy novels and offers up something that is unique, but still contains the mystical flavour of the genre. The world presented is violent and gritty with a no-one-is-safe policy that leads for some edgy, often tense reading. The characters are wonderfully developed and fleshed out so well that they could easily be real people, and the different points of view throughout the novel offer unique perspectives on the story's events. This is perhaps the first book I've read in a long time about which I can't come up with something I don't like, aside from a couple characters...but, as I said earlier, not liking certain characters for aspects of their complex personalities is part of what makes the novel so, well, likeable. Five stars happily given for the above and for reviving my interest in fantasy.",positive
181,Audible Books & Originals,"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"First off, I'm a heavy duty fan of GRRM. I've read over a 100 different fantasy authors in my time (started at 12; I'm now 32). Took about 5 years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic and cliched.
So, when I came back to fantasy at the end of 1999, I read the usual: Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then someone told me about GRRM and man, that was the kicker!
Here are the reasons to choose GRRM. I've also listed the reasons not to choose him to make it fair b/c I know their are certain personalities who won't like this series:
WHY TO READ GRRM
(1) YOU ARE TIRED OF FORMULAIC FANTASY: good lad beats the dark lord against impossible odds; boy is the epitome of good; he and all his friends never die even though they go through great dangers . . . the good and noble king; the beautiful princess who falls in love with the commoner boy even though their stations are drastically different . . . you get the idea. After reading this over and over, it gets old.
(2) YOU ARE TIRED OF ALL THE HEROES STAYING ALIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDER CONSTANT DANGER: this gets even worse where the author kills a main hero off but that person comes back later in the story. Or, a hero does die but magic brings him back.
This sometimes carries to minor characters where even they may not die, but most fantasy authors like to kill them off to show that some risked the adventure and perished.
(3) YOU ARE A MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFF: this story was influenced by the WARS OF THE ROSES and THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR.
(4) YOU LOVE SERIOUS INTRIGUE WITHOUT STUPID OPPONENTS: lots of layering; lots of intrigue; lots of clever players in the game of thrones. Unlike other fantasy novels, one side, usually the villain, is stupid or not too bright.
(5) YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BIASED OPINIONS AND DIFFERENT TRUTHS: GRRM has set this up where each chapter has the title of one character and the whole chapter is through their viewpoint. Interesting tidbit is that you get their perception of events or truths. But, if you pay attention, someone else will mention a different angle of truth in the story that we rarely see in other novels. Lastly and most importantly, GRRM doesn't try to tell us which person is right in their perception. He purposelly leaves it vague so that we are kept guessing.
(6) LEGENDS: some of the most interesting characters are those who are long gone or dead. We never get the entire story but only bits and pieces; something that other fantasy authors could learn from to heighten suspense. Additionally, b/c the points of views are not congruent, we sometimes get different opinions.
(7) WORDPLAY: if you're big on metaphors and description, GRRM is your guy. Almost flawless flow.
(8) LOTS OF CONFLICT: all types, too; not just fighting but between characters through threats and intrigue.
(9) MULTILAYERED PLOTTING; SUB PLOTS GALORE: each character has their own separate storyline; especially as the story continues and everyone gets scattered. This is one of the reasons why each novel is between 700-900 pages.
(10) SUPERLATIVE VARIED CHARACTERS: not the typical archetypes that we are used to in most fantasy; some are gritty; few are totally evil or good; GRRM does a great job of changing our opinions of characters as the series progress. This is especially true of Jaime in book three.
(11) REALISTIC MEDIEVAL DIALOGUE: not to the point that we can't understand it but well done.
(12) HEAPS OF SYMOBLISM AND PROPHECY: if you're big on that.
(13) EXCELLENT MYSTERIES: very hard to figure out the culprits; GRRM must have read a lot of mystery novels.
(14) RICHLY TEXTURED FEMALE CHARACTERS: best male author on female characters I have read; realistic on how women think, too.
(15) LOW MAGIC WORLD: magic is low key; not over the top so heroes can't get out of jams with it.
REASON TO NOT READ GRRM
(1) YOU LIKE YOUR MAIN CHARACTERS: GRRM does a good job of creating more likeable characters after a few die. But, if that isn't your style, you shouldn't be reading it. He kills off several, not just one, so be warned.
(2) DO NOT CARE FOR GRITTY GRAY CHARACTERS: if you like more white and gray characters, this may unsettle you. I suggest Feist or Goodkind or Dragonlance if you want a more straight forward story with strong archetypes.
(3) MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEWS TURN YOU OFF: if you prefer that the POVS only go to a few characters, this might be confusing for you.
(4) SWEARING, SEX: there's a lot of it in this book just as there is in real life.
(5) YOU DEMAND CLOSURE AT THE END OF EVERY BOOK: this isn't the case for all stories in the series. Some are still going on; some have been resolved; others have been created and are moving on.
(6) IF YOU WANT A TARGET OR SOMEONE TO BLAME: this can be done to some extent but not as much. This is b/c he doesn't try to make anyone necessarily good or evil.
(7) ARCHETYPES: some readers like archetypal characters because it's comfortable; we like the good young hero (sort of like Pug in Feist's THE RIFTWAR SAGA); it's familiar and we sometimes like to pretend we're this upcoming, great hero. You wont' get much of this in GRRM with the exception of one or two characters.
(8) LENGTH: you don't want to get into a long fantasy epic series. In that case, look for shorters works as this is biiig.
(9) PATRIARCHY: men are most of the main characters with lots of power (one female exception). ....",positive
182,Audible Books & Originals,"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I am writing this review as an individual who watched Game of Thrones on HBO before picking up the book series, so with that in mind you may or may not find my review helpful/useful. I will also try to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible.

As a fan of the tv series, I came into this book knowing what to expect; I was told that Season 1 and Book 1 are very similar, and that is most certainly true. But do you know what? I still loved the book. I’ll do list format for the book’s good and bad points (in my opinion and in no particular order) to make this a little more organized.

GOODS:

DIALOGUE/WRITING - George RR Martin has a way with words. His descriptions of the various locations and lands and kingdoms of Westeros, from Winterfell to King’s Landing to Vaes Dothrak, have flawless flow. I love descriptive writing, and there is always a fine line between not describing something enough to give the reader a good picture and going overboard to the point where it gets boring to read through paragraphs of superfluous text. This is especially true in the fantasy genre, where the lands and people and words and customs are all…well, fantastical. This book finds that balance, with evocative, beautiful language that puts you right in that setting and right in the thick of the action. Hell, the descriptions of food always made me hungry even if they were serving something that I would never actually eat! As for the dialogue, if you are a fan of the show’s dialogue, or clever dialogue in general, you will enjoy this book. There are a good number of memorable and poignant quotes throughout the book, my favorite being “When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die,” an apt summary for sure. Bottom line, when you pick up this book, be prepared to engross yourself and be swept away to a foreign land.

VOICES/POINTS OF VIEW - Notable about this book, and all the books in the series, is that it is constantly switching from various characters points of view (POVs, as I’ll refer to them from now on). And by various, I mean roughly 7-8 characters. As difficult as this is to pull off, Martin does a great job. It’s an effective way to see what is going on in multiple locations at roughly the same time while keeping us invested. I applaud his decision to present us the information this way as it gives us a greater connection with the characters and more insight into various situations as we see how they are impacting the character that we are viewing it through. Not to mention, Martin manages to keep each of the individual POVs unique enough that you don’t need to flip back to see who’s narrating. Each character has distinct personality traits and ways of thinking/speaking that distinguish them from the others. Sansa is lady-like, a romantic and naive. Arya is fiery, resourceful and a fighter. Tyrion is shrewd, astute and full of quick-witted jibes. And so on and so forth. It is also worth noting that each character, even if a few of them are in the same place at the same time, sees different things and different people and analyzes situations in different ways, so each chapter gives you new information in some way or another. It’s very cleverly done and just as frustrating when you realize “UGH this character doesn’t know what was revealed to me, the reader, in THIS CHARACTER’S chapter” which is a great way of keeping you hooked.

CHARACTERS: HEROES VS VILLAINS - Getting inside the characters heads, you start to understand their motives and the ways that they think. So you get to decide for yourself what motives are justified and who you believe in or who you’re rooting for. But then again, just because one character appears to be the “hero” of the story, doesn’t mean they’ll necessarily get a happy ending. If you’re looking for a feel-good story about about good conquering evil, this probably isn’t for you. If you’re looking for a story with deep, cunning characters who you can’t always trust, who are shades of grey versus black and white, then you’ll find this book a compelling read.

DEPTH - Martin has done his homework and has developed rich histories for each of the characters and their houses. Hell, the Appendix of the book has small blurbs about each house, its history, its sigil, its words/slogan and the relevant members of the house. It’s always available for you to flip back and read if you find yourself confused, which can happen. Having watched the tv series, I was less confused about the various Houses and characters coming into the book, which helped a lot. Yet I still found myself learning new information from the Appendix. It’s a great tool and shows the author’s dedication to his characters and their backgrounds. I was impressed by how richly developed everything was, even though this is only the first book in the series.

NO TEENAGE DIARY DESCRIPTIONS ABOUT SEX - This book has sex in it. Quite a bit, too. I can see how this would be off-putting to some readers. Personally, I don’t mind it much. What I appreciated was that the descriptions of sex weren’t long, drawn out, excessively pornographic or mushy-gushy. I appreciated not having to wade through pages upon pages of “his fingers brushed against my fingers and my heart fluttered, he looked at me and I admired his beautiful eyelashes” or other mushy teenage romance dialogues that frankly bore the poop out of me. On the other hand, you’re not reading through pages and pages of detailed erotica either. It’s written very matter-of-factly, very bluntly and to-the-point and only went into a bit more description when it was warranted. Again, I imagine this isn’t for everyone, so you may consider this a negative. The way it was presented throughout the book, however, I felt warranted a checkmark in the “Good” category.

FEMALE CHARACTERS - Some of the best depictions of female characters I have read. I was very impressed. The female characters are at all ends of the spectrum in this book, from feminine to tough to conniving. In a book where you’d assume the male characters take front and center, the female characters are just as fascinating, if not moreso in some cases.

X-RAY - I have the Kindle version of this book. The X-Ray features really helps you keep track of the book’s many characters and remind you who someone is if you forget, which is SUPER helpful. I used the features many times throughout the book and it definitely aided my understanding and allowed me to further appreciate the depth of the characters and the story.

--
BADS:

MULTIPLE POVs SLOW DOWN THE ACTION - The constant cutting back and forth between different characters and settings, while well done, also has the side effect of slowing down some of the action. You end a chapter on a cliffhanger as the one character’s POV learns something horrifying or experiences something shocking. But then the next chapter jumps to a character who is in a completely different setting and you have to wait until you get to a chapter of a character who is in place where the cliffhanger first happened. It slows down the action a bit, which can get a little frustrating. If it really bothers you to read a cliffhanger and then wait a few chapters to see a reaction or resolution to that cliffhanger, then this book might frustrate you more than entertain you. Not to mention, if you find one character’s voice/writing style/actions particularly boring, you might find it tiresome to have to wade through those chapters to get to the “good stuff.” I know I personally had that problem in a few instances.

TYPOS - I have the Kindle version of this book, and it had quite a number of typos. Not on every page or anything, but more than I would have liked. A few of them sort of interrupted the flow of the story while I was reading, but for the most part they aren’t a huge deal. Just a little annoying.

LENGTH - Not gonna lie, flipping through the Table of Contents and realizing there are 72 chapters was a little daunting. And if you have a really busy schedule, you might find the length a little scary too. I’m very glad I stuck it out and plowed through, though!

183,Audible Books & Originals,"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"If you're going to consider reading `The Song of Ice and Fire' series, then be prepared for an investment. These books aren't for casual readers, but rather slower and more methodical ones. Requiring a great deal of your time, attention to detail, and the memorization of various characters' political and social associations. The amount of content the book contains is equal to the level of commitment you are willing to give. This may sound intimidating to some people, but Games of Thrones is able to deliver a very deep story targeting a mature audience because of this, though this also means the book's level of comprehension and adult content may become a deal-breaker to some people. Persevere and you'll enjoy one of the best fantasy epics in quite some time.

As I previously said, the narrative of A Game of Thrones can be quite cumbersome to comprehend at the very beginning, and the faint synopsis doesn't exactly paint a very big picture of what's to come. So I've decided to provide a brief synopsis of my own.

With the murder of King Robert Baratheon's Hand `Jon Aryn', his Majesty himself has requested that his old friend Eddard Stark, head of House Stark take up the role at his side in King's Landing to help him properly govern the realm. Of course taking up this honorable task would mean Eddard, `Ned' must leave the sanctity of Winterfell and his family. But he soon realizes that treachery and deception have consumed the nobility, no one can be trusted, everyone is trying to seize power by any means necessary; particularly the cunning Lannister family. The book doesn't just follow the character Ned, but rather a large collection of personas, some intertwine with the central story arc involving Ned, others involve their own. Daenerys Targaryen, one of the last of the feared House Targaryen, is forced into a marriage with a savage Dothraki warlord in order to gain in army for the means of reconquering her rightful throne. The last major story arc involves Ned's bastard son `Jon Snow' and his indoctrination in the enigmatic `Night's Watch', where desertion is punishable by death.

While the plot of A Game of Thrones is truly an epic piece of fiction-writing, it would be nothing if the characters weren't believable. George R. R. Martin has established himself as a very strong character-driven author, one who focuses on the problems of these people and how they affect them. While there are characters which are not affiliated with Eddard Stark, the majority of the major characters can be allocated into the two major noble families: the Starks and the Lannisters. The Starks characterize honor, duty, diligence, and integrity, making them the primary protagonists. They're opposed by the ambitiously materialistic Lannister family, who seem like Martin's equivalent of the Borgia's. Though if there's a weakness in the characterization department, it would be that not enough is done with characterizing the Lannister family. The Stark family makes up the bulk of the story's protagonists, but they aren't exactly perfect. They can be rude, selfish, jealous, and even bratty at times, they're delightfully flawed characters. With the exception of the great character `Tyrion Lannister', we're given very little insight into the life of the family aside from their obvious immoral tendencies. The Lannisters, while morally vague, come off feeling much less defined. I really wish more could have been done with them when compared to the excellently characterized Stark family.

In a seemingly endless miasma of betrayal and deceit, the only beacon of hope comes in the form of family. The Starks, particularly the Stark children felt like the real heart of the book for me. Their precious innocence helps invest the reader in the story even further, especially since they're among the victims in this malicious game that the adults are playing. It only reinforces the insurmountable stakes and that nobody is truly safe or completely innocent.

Even the world itself feels like a character that helps ground the reader in the author's fiction. Martin's `Seven Kingdoms' are vividly brought to life with intricate detail that makes it really pop off the pages. Its geography, political structure, and the dominant noble houses are all elaborated upon in surreal detail that really gives the reader a feeling of place. Less reliance on more fantastical elements like elves and dwarves gives Martin's world a pinch of reality that most authors tend to avoid. With the exception of the `White Walkers' and the extinct dragons, all mystical aspects are kept at an all-time low, favoring words and steel over mysticism and spells. The outcome is a fantasy world that surprisingly, comes off as genuinely plausible. The Seven Kingdoms feels like a realm that very much could have existed. It's an interesting divergence from the typical high fantasy settings.

There's going to be the inevitable comparison between Martin's work and the legacy left behind by Tolkien as the great forefather of fantasy writing. The notion of comparing the two is entirely misguided, simply because Martin's writing is completely different from Tolkien's in nearly every angle. Tolkien emphasized the ongoing struggle between good and evil, the thrill of high adventure in a fantastical world, and the triumph of great heroes over terrible villains who would do the world harm. Martin on the other hand is much less black and white with his delivery. There are obvious characters you can label as `dishonorable', while others stand atop a pedestal as paragons of altruism. But are these characters truly evil for trying to secure the benefit of their family and future generations to come? And are these characters considered good if they're ensuring the stability of the realm by dishonest methods? Martin chose to forgo typical fantasy conventions of magic and obvious morality in the favor of characters who feel genuinely believable in all the most despicable ways. They're not the great heroes Tolkien illustrated; they're morally ambiguous human beings. That's the defining characteristic which separates these two giants of fantasy, the selfless heroes and the morally grey humans. Comparing these two juggernauts is completely irrelevant, for Martin isn't trying to replicate Tolkien but rather make his own beast.

Yet, I never like to jump on a bandwagon and proclaim with the rest of the world that a novel is absolutely perfect. Of course these critiques are personal ones and admittedly border on flat-out nitpicking. The first is the absolutely insane overabundance of minor characters. I'm not referring to the central characters that the various chapters shift between; they're all perfectly characterized and fascinating. I'm referring to the endless onslaught of characters that overcrowd the book, but serve little importance in the greater scheme of things. Every story arc is jam-packed with so many characters that range from semi-important to useless. I usually wouldn't mention this, but with a book of this magnitude it really became an issue with me, though it may not for other people. The second issue is the lack of a proper climax to the story. I'm all for having an intriguing plot over a mindless slog of action scenes, but with a book of this size, it would have been nice to have it end with a bang. It's little things like these that stand out when the rest of the book is just so good.

When Hollywood absolutely bastardized the final Harry Potter novel by splitting it into two movies in order to fill their glutinous craving for money; I became somewhat of a skeptic to segmenting visual adaptations of popular literature. Creating a television show made me raise an eyebrow, ""instead of making a movie they're going to milk it with a whole season of episodes"" I thought. After reading A Game of Thrones, I realized that making a television show out of the book isn't just a good idea, it's absolutely mandatory. This book and its sequels have so much content in them that a movie would never do the plot and its various characters justice. It's the perfect source material for an epic fantasy television series, which is great considering we don't exactly have many of those.

A Game of Thrones is the start of something special. The beginning chapter of an epic tale that needs to be read by everyone of age who can truly appreciate its complexity. Read the book first before you watch the show, only then can you truly appreciate George R. R. Martin's natural talent for weaving such incredible stories.",positive

A Song of Ice and Fire, by George R. R. Martin consists of:
1. A Game of Thrones (to be aired as the HBO series Game of Thrones on April 17, 2011)
2. A Clash of Kings
3. A Storm of Swords
4. A Feast for Crows
5. A Dance with Dragons (via Martin's ""Not a Blog"" LiveJournal, he has 3 POV chapters left to finish at the time of this writing.)
6. The Winds of Winter (forthcoming)
7. A Dream of Spring (forthcoming)

What's all the fuss?

This series is the progenitor of a new wave of literature which combines elements of epic fantasy, dark fantasy, and intellectual literary fiction. The idea was to create a true world (in all its color, grit, mystery, politics, realism and so on) through cultured prose, and yet still have all the elements of escapist fantasy; the idea was to create real people with real drama, and insert them into a fantastic reality; the idea was to reinvent the fantasy genre from cliché hack-and-slash/sword-and-sorcery to something original, passionate, and enthralling.

Martin succeeded in these goals, and inspired others to follow in a similar vein: The Malazan Book of the Fallen, The Kingkiller Chronicles, The Prince of Nothing, The Gentleman Bastard, The First Law, etc.

Why so good?

1. Exceptional writing: Martin is a literary master. His prose doesn't just ""work,"" it really inspires. His vocabulary is learned yet approachable. The text inserts me directly into this medieval kingdom. Imagery runs rampant with details galore. Just a very well written story.

2. Believable characters: Grey characters! Real, believable characters with unique dialogue, motivations, and reactions populate this entire series. Martin develops interesting personalities with his talent for voice. These characters come alive within just a few pages of reading their chapters. People change! What a concept!

3. Risk: This is a world of blades and steel, arrows and leather. People die in war. This is a story of politics, intrigue, and betrayal. People are assassinated. Main characters may serve as a central window into the chief plotline, but that certainly doesn't mean that they are safe from harm. Pain and death MEAN something, and Martin loves to make us feel.

4. History: Martin has spent years living in this world, and the history is so rich that the immersion is instant. It's almost disorienting. The details that he has planned out and the meticulousness of the layers within the story are so natural that you cannot help but be in awe.

5. Tactful use of fantasy elements: No ""magic missile"" spells or ""jelly-legs"" jinxes here. There are strong fantasy elements, but they are used in tactful, and oftentimes subtle, ways. The supernatural is seen as superstition by most of the characters in the story, and so when something akin to ""magic"" does show up, it is unique and potent.

6. Details matter: Watch the description of a character, even if you don't know the character's name; they'll show up later. Actually think about what people say; you may be able to find out the answer to a question far before the characters do. Dreams and prophecies may be vague, but they are actually vital! Martin has also acknowledged his use of the unreliable narrator (in fact, he has to use it, in order to make the POV chapters believable); find the inconsistencies between what happens and what characters think, and see the story from a different perspective!

7. Engaging plot: All three main plotlines are exotic and entertaining: the fight for power over Westeros' throne, the exile of the last Targaryen queen, and the threat of the Others in the north. Filled with cliffhangers chapter after chapter, mysteries that need solving, epic moments of badassery, horrible moments of dread, cool one-liners and philosophical quotes, raunchy sex, and violent death, the story is brimming with awesome.

Why doesn't everyone like this series, then?

Virtually every one- or two-star review I have seen (amazon, goodreads, etc.) can be boiled down to one of three categories:
1. ""The Fantasy Lover"" (a.k.a. ""Sex is Nasty"" Syndrome)
a. ""Ew, it's so gross and disgusting and tragic and there's so much sex and violence and swearing! Where is my damsel being rescued by the handsome, heroic prince? Why do people die? I felt like `washing in industrial cleanser' to get this filth away from me! Fantasy should only be about romantic ideals and have nothing to do with reality... and the good guys should always win!""
b. To you, I say, stop being such a prude. The writing is excellent and appropriate to its content, and the idea is to explore the connection between fantasy and reality. Fantasy does not have an ""end purpose"" in mind, and you are simply being obstinate about originality and progress. People are not black and white and neither is life; people die, and people are maimed, and people have sex, and people go to the bathroom, and people are raped, and sometimes, the `bad guys' win; however, I think escapist fantasy may be even MORE engaging when combined with those aspects of reality... and that is an opinion enjoyed by millions of people.

2. ""The Whiner"" (a.k.a. ""The Author is My Bitch"" Syndrome)
a. ""It's been five years since the last book, and Martin is fat and old, and he has his fingers in so many pies, and he doesn't care about the series anymore, and he's just trying to milk it, and why can't he finish it already, and I could have the next book written by now, and and and and and....""
b. To you, I say, no, the author is not your slave. Your buying his books did not indenture him into servitude, nor did it oblige a contract. He writes when he writes, and you read when he's done. Complaining about it [timing, his other projects, etc.] makes you look pathetic, silly, and a tad bit unstable. It's like trying to intimidate a world-renowned TV chef to finish his/her magnum opus because you just want lunch on your TV tray, damnit! How full of yourself do you have to be?
c. Also, the books do not deserve a one star rating simply because they aren't coming out as fast as you want.

3. ""The Pragmatist"" (a.k.a. ""But Reading Takes So Much Time!"" Syndrome)
a. ""The first book is 800 pages, and they just get longer from there; there's no end in sight for the series and no single book tells a full story; there's too much exposition with too much `backstory'; the plot is so slow!""
b. To you, I say... well, this might actually be a valid concern for some people. The story IS huge... but in case you didn't see the genre description, it is EPIC fantasy, and Martin has himself described it as having a ""cast of thousands."" The advantages of longer books are that characters can develop into fully fleshed out beings and that a fictional world can become, in some part, real. It's also a huge story in terms of scope - the synopsis states it simply enough: ""...where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime....""

Minor Spoilers on Individual Books:

A Game of Thrones
A brilliant first book, this begins each of the three main plots. For the first plot, the main house we deal with here is the Starks, the house ""in charge"" of the North. For the second plot, we are introduced to the naiveté of Daenerys (Duh-NAIR-iss) and for the third, we get to see the shabby condition of the Night's Watch. Though each plot develops independently, it is easy to see how they interconnect. The characters really drive this piece, and it is a true trip for anyone, new or old, to the genre. A 5 star book if there ever was one.

Obliviously, I not only recommend this specific book, but the entire series. All the best, and happy reading!",positive
185,Audible Books & Originals,"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"A long journey with no end in sight. I'll try to avoid much plot beyond was it needed to be mentioned and focus more on the strengths and failings of each book.

The first of a planned trilogy turned two trilogies turned to seven, possibly eight books, A Game of Thrones begins as one story but ends somewhere else entirely. Following the usurping of the ""mad king"" King Robert Baratheon has sits upon the Iron Throne uncomfortably (as if there was any other way to sit upon a seat made entirely of swords melted together) caring more to hunt, whore and drink than rule. His wife, unbeknown to him, has birthed three children with her own brother and claimed them as Robert's. When his Hand (either the Hand speaks with the voice of the King, or, the King s***s and the Hand wipes) dies suddenly he heads north to Winterfell to induct his childhood friend and partner in rebellion, Neddard Stark to take the position.

Soon the Stark family is divided, Ned's Bastard is sent to The Wall, a massive 700 foot high block of ice that damns the north from the rest of Westeros, as his wife will not have him around without Ned and he can't take him with to court. The two youngest children stay behind while Ned takes his eldest son and two daughters (the older of whom is to marry Robert's heir, Joffery) to Kings Landing to rule.

Soon it is obvious that Robert's wife Cerci has plotted to kill Robert, take Ned stark, claim the thrown for her incest born son and rule as Queen until he comes of age. This is when the story takes flight.

Though it seems to start as a tale of ""winter coming"" (winter being less a season and more like a minor ice-age that hits every other generation or so and my last for years or decades) it quickly turns into a power struggle pulling all the lands off all the world in.

We also meet Danny, the youngest daughter of the ""Mad King"" whose brother attempts to sell her as a wife to gain an army of horse lords to take back the Iron Throne. This ends poorly for the conceded fool, but Danny learns she has the true blood-of-the-dragons in her, she cannot be burned by fire and by the end of the book she has hatched three baby dragons from believed fossilized eggs.

Elsewhere Robert's brothers Renly and Stannis each prepare to claim the throne as word of Joffery's bastard status is spread, as well Robb Stark, the eldest son calls his father's bannermen to lead an assault against the Lannisters. Which leads us to the next novel.

In A Clash of Kings, Martin tells the story of the war of the seven kingdoms. It seems every lord wants to proclaim himself king (new ones pop up every day, it is noted) and they are both marching on Kings Landing, and against each other.

It's here that one of the strongest characters, Tyrion Lannister, twins Cerci and Jamie's younger sibling, a dwarf despised by his family and hated by his father for ""killing"" his mother when he came into the world. Tyrion is well read and educated and early on unaware of the incest between his twin siblings. After being accused in the first book of trying to kill one of the Stark sons, Tyrion has bought his way home with a sellsword and wildlings under his employ and upon finding his father in battle against Robb, is sent to Kings Landing to be Hand to Joffery. Here we see how smart Tyrion is as he outwits both his sister and Stannis at every turn and ultimately saves them all from invasion and secures Joffery's throne a bit longer.

Unlike Game of Thrones, Clash of Kings tells a less character driven story. Many new characters and locations are introduced, which, on first reading can be confusing. Though the first book would have you think the Starks are the focus of these books, you find out fast that anyone can die and there's no clear option for who the reader should perceive as good or bad, or even the better of all other options. As well it seems like Danny has been left with little to do but wonder the dessert, plot revenge, raise her dragons and suffer.

A Storm of Swords may easily be the best book of the series. Bracing, swift and epic (one of the longest of the series at over 1000 pages) it focuses almost squarely on the central characters, advances the plot lines in a satisfying manner and sweeps you into the one real page turning of the series.

Sansa Stark has been un-betrothed to the bastard king Joffery, who is to marry of all people, Renly's widow (a supposed 16 yr old virgin widow.) However, Sansa is swiftly and forcibly (for both) wed to Tyrion the imp, no with half a nose and a full face scar from battle. Tyrion has never seemed to have it out for the Starks like his Sister and Father and is actually as kind to the stiff and horrified Sansa (not quite 13 years old) until they are both accused of murder. Sansa his whisked away by her Aunts new husband and assumes the role of his bastard daughter to hide. Tyrion is locked up and condemned.

Meanwhile Robb Stark learns a hard lesson about breaking vows and he and his mother suffer dearly. Arya, the youngest sister has been captured for ransom, Jon Snow lives and returns from behind the wall with the wildings only to be stuck trying not to take sides in the war as Stannis comes to the aid of the wall and demands to be treated like King even though he's yet to claim the throne. Danny buys 8000 slave warriors trading one of her dragons, then turns them on there masters, sacks the city and heads out to build her army and free slaves on her way to Kings Landing to take back the throne.

Which all leads to the low-point of the series, A Feast for Crows... exactly what we, the readers, may feel we got. Not to say that it's all bad, just a poor choice in publishing. Crows is actually only half of the novel, the other half is the first half of A Dance with Dragons. Confused? Due to length issues Martin took have the character chapters and put them in Feast and saved the other half of the chapters for Dance, but didn't publish them together. Instead he doubled the length of Dance over five years, having the events of that novel and Feast meet in the middle and then run congruent again for the second half.

The result is Feast is almost entirely the story of Kings Landing and the Lannisters with a few chapters on Greyjoy's and Arya and little else. Then in Dance you get the same time frame, but every-one elses stories. Some of it is not only redundant information including sections of chapters reprinted verbatim. In one case a character you know dies in Feast, has several chapters in Dance as the congruent story lines would have him still alive at the early points in the book.

A Game of Thrones (could be titled La Morte D'Eddard) is a strong opening novel about the misfortunes that befall the Stark family which sets up the great war which is the framing for the other books to come.

A Clash of Kings: An epic but often impersonal war story saved by the tales of Tyrion Lannister as he serves as Hand to the King and chief outwiter of his wicked sister, Cerci. Many new characters and locations can make the book a bit hard to follow but the set-up brings us...

A Storm of Swords: The series high point, epic and moving, it fleshes out characters in events in a meaningful way and draws the reader into a real page-turner.

At this point there is clear divide in the structure and writing. Martin begins to write a moment by moment of every character, never does he seem to be able to say, ""A few weeks later"" instead we must get every detail of every moment of everyday. I skipped entire pages of prose with Martin rambling on and on without progressing story or developing character.

A Feast for Crows: This half-entry in the series can drag miles long, completely ignoring the major plot lines of Jon Snow, Danney and Tyrion it leaves us almost entirely at the hands of the Lannisters.

A Dance with Dragons: Finally some life back into the series, tells the events of the characters left out of Feast but sometimes rehashing already known information or lacking suspense as Feast provided spoilers for Dance. Martin sets us up to endure the long winter at last.",positive
186,Audible Books & Originals,"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I finished reading Game of Thrones this morning and I thought a review of the book was in order, despite having mentioned it already on several occasions. Be warned there are spoilers present! So without further delay, here is how George R. R. Martin made me into a fan of epic fantasy:

1. He altered my preconceived notions of what an epic fantasy is supposed to be. In my head, all epic fantasy was simply a retelling of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. It all contained elves and wizards and dragons. Magic played a big role. Ambitious quests were the order of the day. And it was almost always good versus evil. Game of Thrones broke all the rules in this respect. The ""dwarf"" was so through a birth defect. There were no wizards. While magic was hinted at, we see almost none in the book. There were no quests. Nor was there a clear good or evil. (Joffrey seems evil, but he's really just a kid trying to be a man.) From the moment I started reading the book, it was not at all what I expected. And that was refreshing.

2. His characters were among the most complex people I've come across in science fiction and fantasy (Connie Willis has equally complex characters in her novels.) These are not characters who necessarily behave the way their position dictates. A fighter isn't always brave. A lady isn't always meek. An old man isn't always wise and a young boy isn't always a child. The burdens of the leaders of men weigh heavily upon them and that comes through in the book. By the end of the book, I began to feel like I knew some of the characters so well that I could guess at their reactions to a situation and be pleased to find that I was usually right. They feel like friends to me, not caricatures.

3. His world-building is masterful without being intrusive. There is enough of the world and its background to give you a good understanding of the time and place of the events, without taking you out of the story. And yet, there is enough hinted at but not said to leave you wondering. For instance: how on Earth did they build that wall? The society is a complex one (after all, it is a melding of seven kingdoms, each with its own rich history) but it is presented clearly in the narrative at times and places that are appropriate to the story. Unlike Tolkien, Martin doesn't step out of the story to give a lengthy history (except, perhaps, once toward the end of the book when Bran is learning about the early days of his people). The laws in this universe are self-consistent and add value to the story as a whole.

4. He makes you forget you are reading epic fantasy. Instead, from almost the very beginning, you feel like you are integrated into the lives of people in a world that is different from our own, but still recognizable. That there are tropes of epic fantasy becomes incidental. What matters is the story, the characters, and how it all plays out. I think the same is true of Connie Willis' Blackout/All Clear and it is a rare writer that can make you forget the genre in which you are reading, but fall so deeply into a story as to feel as if you've become part of it.

5. He dangles the magic just far enough of your reach to make its effect all the more worthwhile. I call this the Superman-effect. Whenever I watch various incarnations of Superman, I am always looking forward to when and how he will use his powers. But in skilled story-telling, it is few and far-between, even though we want to see it more. Martin hints at powers both great and terrible throughout the novel. There are the direwolves, the Stark's have taken. There is something special about them. There was Bran's remarkable dream during his coma. But really, we only see a remarkable display of magic or effect in two places: first when the wight's attack Jon and the Lord Commander in Castle Black on the Wall. And later, at the very end of the novel when the three dragons are born in a remarkable funeral pyre. Such judicious use of magic, sprinkled tantalizingly throughout the novel but coated thickly only twice had a profound effect on me as a reader.

6. He spins a remarkable tale. There was not a single point in the book where I thought to myself, this is getting a little slow; I really wish I could skip on and find out about so-and-so. Each time I thought it might happen (usually in scenes from Sansa's point of view) I found to my surprise that I was captured by the story being told, by the subplots unfolding, and by the vast tapestry being laid out before me. More often than not, I had to force myself to stop reading or I would have trouble getting up for work the next morning.
He tells a gritty story with an honesty I haven't seen much of in science fiction and fantasy. The grittiness of the world is part of what attracted me to it. These were not tales involving the angelic elves of Rivendell. These were tales of men at war, men who were greedy and rapacious. These were tales of women who were cruel. These were tales of men who strove for honor but didn't always live up to the name. In short these were the tales of ourselves as we really and truly are, not saints, not sinners, but somewhere in that vast purgatory in between. James Morrow in his novel Only Begotten Daughter, as well as in his Godhead Trilogy, is the only one who comes to mind at telling so brutal and honest a tale.

7. He isn't afraid to take risks, up to and including killing off major characters. It was one thing to see Sansa's direwolf, Lady, to be killed by Ned at the order of the King. It was quite another to see Eddard Stark beheaded after living his life for 8/10th of the book. It was almost as difficult to see Khal Drogo's demise, sad and pathetic as it was. Or King Robert's for that matter. It was difficult to see Bran paralyzed, Sansa abused by Joffrey, and Arya begging in the streets. Difficult: but that is life. Nothing can be counted on by yourself in this world that Martin has created and for the reader, that means that no one person is special, despite what they might think of themselves. It leaves plenty of room for surprise and emotion.

Even the most perfect story can't please everyone 100%. If there were any minor flaws in the story, there are two that I would call to attention:

1. I felt that the phrase ""play this game of thrones"" was used a little too much. At least, it stood out to me more than any other phrase in the book. Even ""Winter is coming"" was tempered and used to elevate the mystery of these long winters. But hearing the phrase ""game of thrones"" repeated again and again by the various players didn't ring true to my ears. Once or twice, maybe, but beyond that it felt like the reader was being beat over the head with it.

2. I can only imagine the frustration of the reader who read this book hot off the presses-only to find so many loose-ends untied, with the story ending essentially at a climax-and perhaps with no idea when or if there would be a sequel. In my case, at least, I was able to downloadA Clash of Kings to my Kindle the moment I finished reading Game of Thrones.

I rarely give out a 5-star review and if you look at novels I've ranked with 5-stars, you'll find that it is a very select class. But Game of Thrones has now joined them. And I'm so glad there are more books to discover in this world.

(This review originally appeared on my website: [...])",positive
187,Audible Books & Originals,"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"It's been ages since I originally purchased this book on my Kindle. I saw the size of the book and when I got my Kindle it was one of the first purchases I made. I figured it would be better to carry it on that slim device than to lug around the rather large book. I wanted to read the book prior to the premier of the show but... well that didn't happen. So my goal shifted; I wanted to read the first book before the second season began and that also didn't happen. Well, I gave it a try at least. I began reading this book in April just after I moved to Virginia and didn't have a job. I would spend my mornings putting out job applications and then by late afternoon I'd sit back and read a little. But the size of this book overwhelmed me, not that I haven't read anything of this size before, but for some reason the slow moving percentage on my Kindle wasn't being very helpful. Then I got my temp job and this book was put down.

Back and forth over the past five months I went. I would read a new book, put it down, then read 50 pages of Game of Thrones. Not only that but with trying to maintain a regularly updated book blog with ramblings about books I've read it's hard to just guarantee a number of days to read this huge book. However, I finished a book and went back to GoT for my few chapter read through and realized I was actually pretty darn close to being finished. Only, like, 200 pages left! So I read it in a flash and loved every moment of it then sat back and wondered why I hadn't just read it in one go to begin with.

Nonetheless, let's talk about the book for the very few people out there who haven't read it. Because, it seems, I am the last person in the world who got around to starting this series. If you've seen the show it's a lot like the book; they did a very good job at portraying the characters and many of the scenes in my opinion. Still, this book is long so obviously it has much more detail and scenery than the show does. If you've seen the show but have not read the book I'd suggest doing so!

While I wasn't keen on carrying around a copy of the book because it was so large I do wish, in a way, that I had that opportunity so that I could flip back and forth between the maps and family trees. It would have helped as the cast of the book is huge and the families are very wide spread and detailed. I have forever had issues of remembering people's names, book characters included, and had it not been for the fact that I had already watched the tv show and had faces to place with the names I probably would have been more lost as to who was who and how they were connected.

The story is good, the imagery is good, the description is good. This book is good. If you have a fascination with anything remotely like Tudor history, Arthurian legend or the long, detailed writing in Lord of the Rings then A Song of Ice and Fire is perfect for you. Dragons, princesses, secrets and swords fill its pages and often times left my head spinning. This book has a touch of fantasy but it doesn't go overboard. You aren't stuck feeling like you just slipped into the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy or Hogwarts. It's slipped in so casually that you find yourself, whilst reading the book, to just accept what they are speaking of and not think twice about if dragons exist or the dead can rise and kill.

Martin may put a little too much emphasis into certain details but I suspect they all come around to meaning something and he certainly helps you to picture the world he has created. It reads like some fantastic part of history yet the characters are certainly living and breathing at your ear, over your shoulder, while you go from page to page. Often times I'll read books by authors who have long since left this earth and I'm left feeling melancholy. ""Why don't people write like this anymore? Why don't they put detail into their books and write so beautifully?"" and I think I've discovered that there are authors who write in such ways and Martin is one of them. It's refreshing to be able to read a book so beautifully written and with such perfect detail that is current and published within my lifetime. Could it have been shortened down at some points? Certainly. Every other chapter I found at least a few pages that I could have gone without but what are you going to do? It's not like I didn't already know this was going to be a long book when I began it.

It does have its fair share of sex scenes, incest, and rape so be forewarned of that those of you who like to avoid such plot. But it's relevant to the story, or so it seems... most of the time, so it's kind of worth talking about. Martin leaves a lot of tidbits of information through out the book which you can pick apart in your own time and wonder what it all could mean. Apparently, it's a Thing fans of the series like to do and I can understand why they would when it spans such long periods of time between publications of books. In that regard, I'm glad I waited to pick up the books so that I won't have to wait forever for each book to come out. Granted, when A Song of Ice and Fire was first published I was ten and this was way beyond my reading comprehension but at least now I can take my time, play catch up, and maybe once I'm completely caught up with the books I can join the countless others who eagerly await the next book in the series.

I think what I liked best about the books was that the characters grow and change while you read. Often times you are able to witness how the surrounding events will alter a person or you are simply given privy to details otherwise unnoticed. I started the book with a dead set group of characters whom I liked and ones I disliked but by the end of the book that list had shuffled a little bit. Some of the characters I disliked at first (Sansa, for example) I had begun to like a little more by the end. While I have many other books I have to get through before I start A Clash of Kings I will be happy when I have that opportunity and look forward to it. There are many people out there who love this book and consider it a work of art, the best thing they had ever read, and swear by it. There are others who refuse to speak nothing but negative things about the book - it just did not work for them. For me, I liked it, I enjoyed it, and while I may not be standing on my office's roof proclaiming to the people waiting for their lunches that they must read this book - I still will quietly refer friends to it who are looking for a good tale.",positive

189,Audible Books & Originals,"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I was recommended this book by a friend who said it would be like Tolkien's adventures. However, since I have heard this comparison so often now, I maybe should start my praise by explaining why this book is TOTALLY DIFFERENT from anything J. R. R. Tolkien has ever written. In fact, the only thing Tolkien has in common with this are the presence of strong characters, a somewhat medieval setting, and that a vast and epic world is described. But these are pretty much hallmarks of much of the fantasy genre in general and can hardly be used to distinguish authors. Unlike ""the Lord of the Rings"", ""The Hobbit"", or ""The Children of Húrin"" for that matter, the world of ""A Game of Thrones"" depends much less on magic. Yes, the world that is described contained dragons long ago, but they are gone now. There is talk of giants, but nobody has ever seen them and they may be only rumours. There may be ""The Others"", but again it is unclear whether they really exist or still have any power and they are mostly referred to in curses, much the same way we would say ""To hell with you"" not knowing whether a hell actually exists. The main characters are all clearly human, look human, behave as humans, have human flaws and human strengths. Unlike in Tolkien's books there are no prominent wizards, hobbits, orks, elves, dwarfs, or demons dominating the story line. Secondly, the characters in ""A Game of Thrones"" are neither perfect heroes nor evil to the bone villains. Everybody has their understandable motives and behaves logically from their perspective, although, of course, the goals and ends of the various characters clash causing the wars and conflicts and intrigues to happen that make the book so captivating to read. Unlike Tolkien's adventures, ""A Game of Thrones"" is not about the battle between good and evil, black and white, light and darkness. This makes the whole storyline appear enormously realistic, as the world here is so much more like our own. Also the language is totally different between Tolkien's stories and this book. Whereas Tolkien uses his beautiful poetic language, George R. R. Martin is extremely blunt. Some of the words he uses, I have never seen in a printed book, and if I were to repeat them here in this review, I am sure Amazon would be deleting my entire text. Also the description of cruelty, rape, and war is very graphic in this book. Again, this makes it much more a realistic book, as in our own world these things are (unfortunately) much more common than selfless knights singing poems to their beloved elven girlfriend. However, also ""A Game of Thrones"" plays extensively with language, even though in a very different, more subtle way than Tolkien did. For instance, the names of the characters are often slightly modified variants of existing names (Petyr instead of Peter, Catelyn instead of Catherine, Eddard instead of Edward etc.) and many terms that are used are either invented or ancient versions of existing words (mayhaps instead of perhaps, import instead of importance, turncloak instead of turncoat etc.). This gives the text an interesting effect, providing us with a warm familiarity with the world on the one hand (we often feel at home here), while at the same time we appear to be in a strange, different place. What I, personally, also like is the way how the story is told. The many chapters are rather short but always told from the perspective of a particular main character. Therefore, the reader understands their motives, understands what is driving them to do or not do whatever they are doing, understands why they love or hate or despise other characters and how this influences their actions. And because the perspective out of which the story is told constantly changes, there is no ""absolute truth"", no ""right angle"", no ""good and evil""; only competing interests of all too human players. I will not mention details from the book as I do not want to spoil anyone's fun who has not read it yet. But I will say so much that George R. R. Martin has no problem killing off beloved characters. And unlike in Tolkien's books, dead characters do not come back to life (""Hello Gandalf""). Also this introduces a grim reality into the story. Playing the game of thrones can be deadly.

To me this was the best fantasy story I have read in a long time. I have already started the second book (also great!) and there will be at least five more to come. Given the writing style and the type of story, ""A Game of Thrones"" reads much more like the historical novels from Bernard Cornwell than anything Tolkien has ever written. Which is not to say that Tolkien is not great. I love Tolkien's books (!) but they are very different and I feel the customer should know this before the purchase, particularly as this comparison is made again and again and again for reasons I do not understand. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who likes good fantasy with deep non-stereotypic characters, sad (sometimes really sad!) turns in the story, and a realistic (sometimes too realistic) world with all the cruelties of war, battle, and conquest. Amazon limits me to give a maximum of five stars. I would rather like to give six, seven, or hundred.",positive
190,Audible Books & Originals,Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"I see no reason to write an overly detailed review of this book. Others have beaten me to the punch. So I'll give you a quick overview and then add my reasons for why I think many people need to read this, and why even those who don't might find it quite useful in their own lives.

David Goggins is a retired Navy SEAL who is legendary for his determination, will-power and ability to edure pain. Now, before you throw up your hands, adopt an English accent, and exclaim, ""Och, not another bloody book by a bloody SEAL!"" let me assure you that CAN'T HURT ME is most definitely n o t like all the others you may have read. The Chris Kyles and Marcus Lattrells and what-not were telling war stories and to some extent, making extended commercials for their own branch of the military. Goggins is not. In fact, when it comes to his deployed-in-a-war-zone days, he doesn't write enough to fill out a paragraph, much less a page. He talks about his military training extensively, but only with the larger focus of the book in mind. Which is as follows.

Goggins grew up in an abusive family. His dad was a physically and emotionally abusive hustler who treated him like a slave. He ended up living with his mom and taking comfort in food -- lots of food, so that he eventually became grossly and immensely fat. As one of the only blacks in an all-white school, he was also subjected to terrible racism. By the time he was in his late teens, early 20s, his life was a kind of morbid joke, with his job being to empty traps left in restaurants which were full of dead rats. He had no self-respect and no future. To compress a very complicated story into a few sentences, Goggins eventually came to the conclusion that he must stop seeking out the easy path in life, must ""find comfort in being uncomfortable,"" and constantly seek to challenge himself in every aspect of life. This led him to the SEALs, whose training he had to go through several times due to injuries and illness -- a remarkable feat in itself given the mental and physical brutality of the training. Once a SEAL, however, Goggins continued to find ways to become uncomfortable by seeking out the toughest trainings he could sign up for, including the Rangers and the Delta Force, and by entering marathons and later, the masochistic enterprise known as the ultra-marathon. Eventually he competed in even more punishing activities such as trying to become the Guinness Book of World Records holder in the category of chin-ups (which sounds like my idea of hell.) But the thing which distinguishes him from everyone else is the fact that he did most of this with some severe congenital defects he didn't even know he had at the time. This discovery truly blew his mind and got him asking, ""What if -- ?"" He began to realize that we are largely prisoners of our own perceptions, and are capable of so much more than we think, but we habitually underestimate our potential and settle for what he calls ""the 40%."" His goal for himself, and his goal for you, is to reach 100%. The fact that this may not be possible is irrelevant to him. It's the striving, the discomfort, the pain that he seeks, not because it will get him to the goal but because it is the goal. Seeing what one can endure expands what one can achieve. As writers from Marcus Aurelius to Ernst Jünger have noted, ""the obstacle is the way.""

CAN'T HURT ME is important not for its recitation of all the blisters and sweat and torn ligaments Goggins has endured, or for his achievements as a sailor or an athlete, but for the way he approaches the central questions regarding the difficulties we all face in life. Goggins has plenty of reason to play the vicitim, but chose another path, the path of self-ownership. It really is very simple. For example, when he discusses his obesity, he does not blame his father, racism or society: he blames himself. His mantra in every aspect of his life is that we own our own skin and our own decisions and too often, we use our traumas to justify things like laziness, apathy, cowardice, drug abuse, and alcoholism. Overcoming this self-sabotage requires being brutally honest with oneself. ""Don't call yourself overweight,"" he all but shouts at the reader. ""Say what you really are -- a fat f***!"""" Carl von Clausewitz called this, ""The appreciation of the situation."" Goggins calls it a self-audit. He audits himself regularly, especially when he fails at something, but also when he is successful, too. He encourages a mind-set of brutal honesty with an emphasis on the brutal. He is very frank that he ""gets his strength from a very dark place,"" and his ethos illustrates that, as does this book. He isn't a shiny, happy person. He isn't interested in fame. He doesn't have many friends. Even when he writes about the SEALs, he offers criticism -- something you won't see much if any of in other books by former members. Some readers may be offput by this very darkness, especially in an era in which whining and entitlement (something he especially despises) are now rampant everywhere. But that is why I consider this book important. It comes at a time when many are beginning to suspect that the victim mentality they've been told to sharpen their entire lives is actually an albatross, weighing them down, stranding them in weakness, unhappiness, and failure.

CAN'T HURT ME is a fast and brutal read. It's inspiring, but it's not a feel-good memoir, and one can't help but wonder if Goggins takes any real pleasure out of life. He's sort of the Mace Windu of inspirational writers, a grim-faced warrior monk who is going to poke you in your love-handle and ask if you think that is the best you can do. But should you sweat it off, don't look to him for a pat on the back. Look to him to ask if you couldn't have done it more efficiently...and then to ask you what's next on your list of challenges. And why you aren't working on them yet.",positive

196,Audible Books & Originals,Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I couldn't put this book down. When the pandemic started, I bought a recumbent bike and stretching equipment for my home. I used to go to the gym three times a week. As with Mr Groggins, I, too, am a very driven person. I persevere through many struggles in my life. It has been this way almost all of my life. I am now 65, turning 66 in July. I was married 34 years to a policeman, and I was a court reporter for 24 years, until I was diagnosed with petit mal seizures, which ended my court reporting careerand took away my driving license. My court reporting career created a persona for me. I took incredible pride in what I did. I excelled at my job, and many other reporters look to me as an example. At my retirement, my boss just cried me as the consummate court reporter. I never thought my peers looked at me this way. Of course, I was married to a man that enjoyed the money I made, which he drove me to work even harder and more. The one thing I missed and kept looking for in this book to the end was how Mr. Groggins was going to find that missing Link and his life, and that is the joy of living and not striving to always be the best or better. There is so much more out there in life than striving to be the best and getting better than what you have already accomplished. He seems to have missed part of life that is just plain fun, loving and enjoyable. For example, going out to meals with friends, going to the movies, going on walks, going on vacations, sitting in the backyard and enjoying some good music and a drink. When I left my husband after 34 years, I moved to Lincoln Hills, Sun City. California, in a 55 plus community. I was the youngest one here, yet my vibrance and gregarious nature gave me a lot of friendship. I just totally enjoyed being single and was the happiest single woman that anyone could imagine. I did a missionary in Honduras for 2 weeks, went to Israel and Jordan for two weeks, did two safaris in Africa, three weeks each. This was all by myself. This was true happiness and joy and gave me complete Independence without having to answer to anyone but myself for the first time in my life. Some think I got a little too independent, but I found the real me. I was blessed to have found a man right around the corner, who lost his wife. We were friends before then, as we walked the dogs in the neighborhood and enjoyed that activity. He is a retired captain from San Mateo county fire department. One of the most giving, loving, humble men I have ever met. I never thought at the age of 62 I would be blessed with the life that I have now, because I stopped trying to please everybody else and started pleasing myself. Life has so much more to offer than trying to be the best and pleasing everybody else, especially yourself. It brings so much joy to yourself to please others. I think that is what life is all about. I hope someday Mr Groggins will reach that point in his life. It took me until I was 55 years old, so I suppose you can go back to the old saying, "" it's never too late. "" When I was working my ass off, trying to please everybody else, trying to prove myself in my career make my husband have become, I neglected to see what life is really all about. My father said to me one day ""Ellen, you need to stop and smell the roses."". I never really understood that saying until my husband decided to leave me after 34 years of marriage. Thank you for an incredible work I art in your book, as I am now increasing my drive in a healthier body during this pandemic and always pushing for at least another half a mile a day, and eating wiser. I want to live long, be as happy as I can, knowing that there will be many winding roads and struggles ahead of me, and love from the deepest part of my hesrt that I can.

It starts off explaining about goggins early life and takes you along his journey, giving you tips and tricks goggins used throughout the struggles he faced. Also at the end of every chapter david goggins gives you a little homework in the form of these ""challenges"", ten total, I highly recommend buying this book and doing every single one.

206,Audible Books & Originals,Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I couldn't put this book down. When the pandemic started, I bought a recumbent bike and stretching equipment for my home. I used to go to the gym three times a week. As with Mr Groggins, I, too, am a very driven person. I persevere through many struggles in my life. It has been this way almost all of my life. I am now 65, turning 66 in July. I was married 34 years to a policeman, and I was a court reporter for 24 years, until I was diagnosed with petit mal seizures, which ended my court reporting careerand took away my driving license. My court reporting career created a persona for me. I took incredible pride in what I did. I excelled at my job, and many other reporters look to me as an example. At my retirement, my boss just cried me as the consummate court reporter. I never thought my peers looked at me this way. Of course, I was married to a man that enjoyed the money I made, which he drove me to work even harder and more. The one thing I missed and kept looking for in this book to the end was how Mr. Groggins was going to find that missing Link and his life, and that is the joy of living and not striving to always be the best or better. There is so much more out there in life than striving to be the best and getting better than what you have already accomplished. He seems to have missed part of life that is just plain fun, loving and enjoyable. For example, going out to meals with friends, going to the movies, going on walks, going on vacations, sitting in the backyard and enjoying some good music and a drink. When I left my husband after 34 years, I moved to Lincoln Hills, Sun City. California, in a 55 plus community. I was the youngest one here, yet my vibrance and gregarious nature gave me a lot of friendship. I just totally enjoyed being single and was the happiest single woman that anyone could imagine. I did a missionary in Honduras for 2 weeks, went to Israel and Jordan for two weeks, did two safaris in Africa, three weeks each. This was all by myself. This was true happiness and joy and gave me complete Independence without having to answer to anyone but myself for the first time in my life. Some think I got a little too independent, but I found the real me. I was blessed to have found a man right around the corner, who lost his wife. We were friends before then, as we walked the dogs in the neighborhood and enjoyed that activity. He is a retired captain from San Mateo county fire department. One of the most giving, loving, humble men I have ever met. I never thought at the age of 62 I would be blessed with the life that I have now, because I stopped trying to please everybody else and started pleasing myself. Life has so much more to offer than trying to be the best and pleasing everybody else, especially yourself. It brings so much joy to yourself to please others. I think that is what life is all about. I hope someday Mr Groggins will reach that point in his life. It took me until I was 55 years old, so I suppose you can go back to the old saying, "" it's never too late. "" When I was working my ass off, trying to please everybody else, trying to prove myself in my career make my husband have become, I neglected to see what life is really all about. My father said to me one day ""Ellen, you need to stop and smell the roses."". I never really understood that saying until my husband decided to leave me after 34 years of marriage. Thank you for an incredible work I art in your book, as I am now increasing my drive in a healthier body during this pandemic and always pushing for at least another half a mile a day, and eating wiser. I want to live long, be as happy as I can, knowing that there will be many winding roads and struggles ahead of me, and love from the deepest part of my hesrt that I can. I go by The motto: dance as if no one is watching. Sincerely, Ellen Turinsky. If you choose, you can reach me through my email at eturinsky@yahoo. Great book. I have recommended it too many people.

210,Audible Books & Originals,The Sandman,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Author Neil Gaiman brings us the first 20 issues of the Sandman comic book from DC Comics come to life with a full cast. I started listing to this audio novel due to the Netflix series that is coming. And this a great introduction to the series, yes it starts with humans capturing the Morfius or Dream as he's known in the endless. With 20 episodes it's hard to pin down one to describe and with so much going on that there's guest stars from the Justice League and some of Batman's rouges gallery. This was defiantly one of James McAvoy's greatest performances since he played Leto II in the mini-series Children of Dune. I'm looking forward to listing to Act 2 and as a fan of Neil Gaiman it's going to be great. I highly recommend this audio novel to all DC comics fans.",positive
211,Audible Books & Originals,The Sandman,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"The Audible adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s “The Sandman” covers the events of Gaiman, Sam Keith, and Mike Dringenberg’s series through “The Dream Country,” the third collected volume of the comic. It’s lovely to hear Gaiman himself provide his dulcet tones as the narrator while James McAvoy brings a brilliantly brooding presence to Morpheus. Riz Ahmed is perfect as The Corinthian and Kat Dennings perfectly captures Death’s optimism. Taron Egerton, Andy Serkis, Michael Sheen, Arthur Darvill, Reginald D. Hunter, Joanna Lumley, and Miriam Margolyes further lend their considerable talents to the story.

It helps if readers are familiar with the work. While Gaiman narrates each chapter and provides descriptions as necessary, the stories began in the comic book medium with its blend of text and visual storytelling so some details are lost in translation. The theme also overwhelms at times, with chapters structured like a television series featuring a “teaser” prior to the main titles. That being said, the adaptation gets the story beats right and captures the tone of the original comics perfectly. It’s a great adaptation for fans looking to rediscover the series.",positive
212,Audible Books & Originals,The Sandman,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"This was amazing. Knowing that Neil Gaiman was involved, I had high hopes that it would do justice to the story and be well done, but it exceeded my hopes. I know there are still efforts to come up with a film or TV version of the story, but I have a hard time imagining any better adaptation than what's been done here.

This volume covers the first three volumes of the comic (Preludes & Nocturnes, The Doll's House, and Dream Country). I've read the comic series multiple times, and this did come across as fully unabridged, and in some cases even added some details in the narration (done wonderfully by Neil Gaiman himself) that aren't specifically mentioned in the comic. They did change the order of some of the stories from how they play out in the books, but not in a way that effected the storytelling.

This may be one of my favorite audiobooks ever, and I can't wait to see how they'll do with the rest of the series.",positive

It literally puts me to use my imagination and to see such a story narrated and acted by Neil Gaiman, and James McAvoy as the sandman was superb combination, and others who I've started to recognize as reoccurring actors from other audible dramas.

217,Audible Books & Originals,The Sandman,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,3,"I consider The Sandman series to be a highpoint of the comic book medium, and I can't recommend it enough, and this audio production is very well done, with great voices and production and with Neil Gaiman narrating.

It's a thoroughly enjoyable program until it abruptly ends less than a third of the way through the story, with the Midsummer Night's Dream play. I'm sure there are good reasons for the decision to do it this way but it's very jarring for somebody already familiar with the comics. Anyone who hasn't read the comics should do so as soon as they can and not bother with this.

230,Audible Books & Originals,The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"As someone who has given far too many f***s about far too many things their entire life, this book was exactly the wake up call I needed. Even as a child in elementary school, I would have a miniature meltdown when I got a bad grade or if a friend was mean to me that day. As an adult, I got better at hiding these emotional upheavals and intense reactions to the world around me, but they never really went away with my maturity like I had hoped. I took to heart every disheartening news article I read and every crappy thing that happened to me at work or in school. I'd let it consume me, because I was never told to live life any other way or that controlling my reactions was even remotely possible; I thought it was just a permanent part of my personality. I always knew that it was more of a vice than a virtue, but I felt like I couldn't fully control it.

Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*** employs a witty use of profanity laced with satirical comedy that's bursting with philosophical wisdom. Much of Manson's inspiration originates from nihilists, Buddhists, Albert Camus, and Charles Bukowski, but he brings those philosophies into a more modern and palatable perspective. He reminds us that life is too short to react so passionately about every little thing. We have a limited emotional capacity, and we often squander it on reactions to mean-spirited people or unfortunate events, completely forgetting that, although we can't control the world around us, we can control ourselves. This book has empowered me to exercise control over my reactions.

Shortly after reading this book, my husband commented at how ""zen"" I've become. I'm no longer angrily venting to him about all of the various ways the world upsets me. I still allow myself to feel and talk about things that bother me (I'm not aiming to achieve nirvana as a Buddhist monk), but petty things no longer have a hold on me. I let the negativity wash over me now without letting it absorb into my soul, and my life has been much more enjoyable as a result.

I was so inspired by this book and its philosophy, that I wanted a permanent reminder for myself to further ensure that I use my f***s wisely from now onward. For my birthday, I got this simple, but meaningful tattoo on my right wrist. The ∞ symbol reminds me of the infinite nature of time and outer space, and the 0 on the bottom represents humanity's relevance to time and space as a whole. It can also be translated as don't make something (∞) out of nothing (0) or a reminder that there are infinite opportunities to give a f***, but that I will remain steadfast in giving 0 f***s about things that don't really matter.

If you're the type of person who's struggled to keep their temper in line or if you're like me and you find yourself on an emotional roller-coaster because you take every event in the world and within your own life to heart, I strongly encourage you to read this book. If profanity is so much of a problem for you, that you can't tolerate reading the first half of this book (the last half is much less profane) you're probably too narrow-minded to have taken away any of the many philosophical benefits this book offers.",positive

240,Audible Books & Originals,Finding Me: A Memoir,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"This memoir is about the lovely and incredibly talented Viola Davis. This book was a treat to read, I remember when I saw that she was coming out with a book I went to Amazon to pre-order it. I love that the day it came out it was out for delivered to my house the same day. I could not wait to read it, so I also bought the Audible version of the book and listed to it while I was at work. I told myself that I had to be one of the first to get my review out. Here we are at the end of the month, and I am not one of the first to drop my review lol.
I even joined Oprah’s book club because of this book it was a treat to join in weekly and hear how others were feeling about this book as well. On the last day of book club Oprah sat down with Viola and talked about the book. A few of the chips are on the Instagram page @Oprahsbookclub so make sure you check that interview out as well it was good. She also had a special on Netflix that came out on April 22nd,2022 check that out as well.
This book is all about Viola and her up brining and tells us how she got to be the beautiful women we have grown to love. She talks about when she was younger her father uses to sleep around on her mother and how that affected them. She talks about how they had to deal with racism at an early age as well. She talks about her sisters and brother as well, how she got into acting. How she had to be the backbone to her family at one point in time.
We all talk about the Ciara prayer, but we really need to be talking about the Viola Davis Prayer and how she landed her husband. Their love story is so good, she talks about it on the show Black love. You will learn about her acting career and shows and plays she was in. You learn all about how she snagged the role of Annalise Keating on the hit show “How to Get Away with Murder” and how she changed the last name of the charter.
This book made me at times sad I felt bad for her upbringing how their living situation was not always the best. I love that through it all she never let it stop her but only let it help build up to the person that she is today. Her Relationship with her parents was not the best but as she got older, she was able to change that. She said in this book that when she was making a little bit of money, she would still be sending money home to help her family I thought to myself like she did not have to do that, but she did.
I genuinely enjoyed this book I rated this book at 4 out five stars. I did not rate this book a five because even though I love Viola, and this was the kind of book I did not want to put down it was missing something. It was missing something that mad made feel like if I did not finish it that day, I would go crazy. Everything else about this book was good I do not have any take aways from it. I love that her books have photos and that the cover of the book is not so busy its simple black and white.

241,Audible Books & Originals,Finding Me: A Memoir,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I first discovered Viola Davis on Brene Brown’s podcast “Unlocking us”. As soon as she started talking, I felt this immense opening within her and myself, too. She was just the most honest, forthcoming woman, and I could tell right away from the topics she discussed and the unapologetic way she spoke. I knew from that moment on I wanted to invest more time into getting to know Viola in the only way I knew how-to listen to more podcasts with her, and read her book. I discovered this book shortly after I discovered the podcast and was SO incredibly excited to read it. I knew the book would be nothing short of amazing, and it was.

The first half of the book or so is just Viola setting the scene if her childhood. Really pouring her damn heart and soul out to show you how she grew up. I felt like I was there witnessing it there with her. Her words are powerful, but not in the “her words make you think” type of way….powerful in the sense that it makes you feel like you are THERE with her. I experienced a lot of emotional pain while reading this. Little Viola went through so much simply because she is black and was poor. People treated her so horribly, she went through so much abuse, so much trauma, and it shook me. BUT I’m so thankful she shared these stories of hers. They’re so incredibly vulnerable, I can’t imagine the strength and bravery it took for her to write this.

The next section of the book is about all of her acting/theatre life taking off and her stories with that. It took quite a sharp turn from the trauma, to acting life-but such is life, right? There’s not always a linear path, but it was a bit tricky for me to adjust from the trauma to the acting bit. Not dogging on her, it’s still a great book, just my opinion that the transition was a bit tricky to dive into at first.

The last few chapters have a lot of wisdom and share her thoughts about systemic racism, what it means to be a black woman in a lead-acting feminine role, etc. Its a very good book-I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a book that’s raw with truth. Viola is a survivor. She’s someone I look up to immensely because of her bravery and vulnerability. Read the book!",positive

I also appreciated her honesty and vulnerability in sharing her experiences within the film and TV industry. It was painfully educational. Some racism is systemic.

She is so strong but also so vulnerable throughout this book and I did not want this book to end. Looking forward to more life lessons from Viola Davis!",positive

I cannot understand the discrimination even among blacks, where being dark skinned is so discriminated against and unappealing. People are so beautiful from their pure heart that it tears me inside to understand the way people are treated no matter what color of their skin. I thank you Viola for putting this out there for I believe no matter what color skin a person has, this is going to bring them so much awareness and peace amongst themselves to reconcile with their past and their future. I know you have done this for me 💕 I was abused as a child and did not really understand this. My thoughts and feelings never matter to anyone. When I got older I did realize that my mother could not be who I needed her to be and understand that she did the best she could with what she knew. I needed and wanted to be better. I cannot say that I forgave my father because it comes up in my thoughts at odd times and I can feel my anger. But I understand your path and the ride of understanding that you have come to.

250,Audible Books & Originals,"The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Of all the non-fiction books I've read, this is by far the best one ever. I grew up in a tough way. Lots went wrong. My brother and I believed we were unwanted and we had plenty of evidence to back up our sentiment. We suffered shared abuse and individual abuses of every kind imaginable. When I became an adult, I subscribe to the concepts of people like Rush Limbaugh and drove around listening to his radio show proclaiming that there is no such thing as post-traumatic stress disorder. I believed I could gut it out, that the past was the past and that only weak people needed to talk through their problems. I believed only losers behaved badly as adults due to anything in their childhood or past and that claiming you were affected by any past problem was a crutch to allow you to embrace failure. Frankly, for a time, that approach worked for me. I got married, had some great children (still have them thankfully), built a company. But it didn't take too long until it all came crashing down. And, when it did, I spent nearly 1.5 decades down. The anxiety that was always in my throat and chest was, to put it mildly, a distraction. It's very hard to be kind to people, to focus on your work, to love others when all your power is spent trying to pretend you don't feel like s***. When you can't sleep because your heart is beating so forcefully that the entire bed is vibrating - at least it feels that way - you not only lose the joy of sleep, but you feel hopeless and miserable and even more so when you're not able to understand why you feel this way. When you see everything you have go away and can only occasionally find the strength to take care of yourself and your business and need others in your life to carry you from time to time (much to your embarrassment) and yet you think you're smart and capable and have no understanding of why you are where you are, life becomes a slog. You trudge through it wishing you were dead or that something would kill you even if, like me, you'd never kill yourself. Literally, when I was a believer, I went to bed every night and my prayers went something like this, ""Dear Jesus, please have a bus run over me. I will never kill myself but I'm miserable. Please let me die so my family won't hate me for killing myself but so that I can stop hating the sun coming up. In Jesus name, Amen."" If you're like I was (and it's hard to tell you how I was and hold the tears down even now), this book will help you change all that. It will describe in detail what you're going through and it captures so many of those subtleties as to make it absolutely amazing. For the first time, I don't have depression (and I don't take pills). I don't have anxiety (it still bubbles up on occasion but using mindfulness, it goes nearly as fast as it comes). My life is pointed in the right direction, my business future is hopeful, my love-life is stabilizing, I know I'll no longer lose friends. I'm finally on track to getting what I want in every area of my life from women to money to friends and deep connections with my family. While I can't attribute every part of my success to this book alone as it takes many things to get where you want to go (mostly you), I can absolutely attest to the power of this book. If you've suffered any sort of major and/or persistent trauma in your life, please buy (and read) this book. You will one day thank yourself for doing so.",positive
251,Audible Books & Originals,"The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Psychiatrist, professor, world-class researcher, and traumatologist Bessel van der Kolk MD requires no introduction to trauma psychotherapists. My enduring impressions of him over many years is one of relevance, cogency, frankness, and accessibility - served up with a subtle dash of impishness. He tends to be a bit disruptive - something of a provocateur - and everything of his I have ever read has taught me something, confirmed something important, or pushed my thinking in a new direction. When he has something to say, I want to hear it.

However, I almost didn't buy this book: I was put off by the title. Familiar with major reviews of PTSD psychotherapy outcomes research, I know that research support for body-oriented approaches to treating psychological trauma psychopathology is thin at best, and such treatment models simply do not have the research validation of either EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) and PE (Prolonged Exposure), neither of which are especially body-focused.

J. Interlandi's excellent article anticipating publication of this book - ""A Revolutionary Approach to Treating PTSD"" (New York Times Magazine, 2014.05.22 - available online) - initially supported my fears that for some inexplicable reason van der Kolk was now promoting some treatment model for which we have little confirming research. ""Psychomotor therapy is neither widely practiced nor supported by clinical studies,"" Interlandi informs us. Provocateur he may be, but I'm strongly biased in favor of paying attention to therapies for which we do have solid empirical validation. Our clients do not deserve to be experimental subjects - maybe not even if they agree to this, as I'm not sure they can ever know enough to make a truly informed consent. Knowledge that PTSD and related disorders are usually highly curable, when using the right treatment protocols, sadly remains the possession of a minority of people, even in the professional psychotherapy world.

Yet the account of van der Kolk's therapy work in Interlandi's article is gripping. Becoming completely absorbed in the account, I was convinced. (I've been here before, reading van der Kolk's own accounts of his work.) And so the disruption begins! Deeper into the article, he has me. Van der Kolk's critique of CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy - a general class of therapies) and PE (E. Foa's exposure therapy model) is withering and correct: neither really work. ""Trauma has nothing whatsoever to do with cognition...It has to do with your body being reset to interpret the world as a dangerous place....It's not something you can talk yourself out of."" Interlandi reports that ""That view places him on the fringes of the psychiatric mainstream.""

But he's right, and I can't stress this enough. Why? Because as a trauma treatment professional I'm well aware of what the trauma treatment outcomes research actually says. The best current summary of this research well may be chapter 2 of Ecker, et al.'s (2012) ""Unlocking the emotional brain"". (Buy this book, too!) Ecker et al. brilliantly presents a synthetic summary that encompasses 11 existing therapy models which actually DO cure trauma psychopathology, if done right. In this context, what van der Kolk is doing makes perfect sense. Finally, it appears, the trauma psychotherapy field is moving toward a consensus which has strong credibility.

Van der Kolk's new book has many virtues. Parts One and Two (102 pp) provide a substantial review of the neuropsychology of trauma's impact on a person. It's fun, interesting, informative reading, for professional and layperson alike. Part Three (64 pp) surveys childhood development, attachment experience, and ""the hidden epidemic of developmental trauma"". Van der Kolk has for years been a leading champion of the idea that there is a type of PTSD which substantially differs from all the rest. It develops in response to chronic child abuse and/or neglect. I completely share his belief that the diagnosis of Developmental Trauma Disorder (sometimes called C-PTSD, with ""C"" meaning ""Complex"") is overdue for formal recognition. I find his review of the struggle to legitimize DTD as gripping and distressing as anything else in the book. It is anguishing to know that a major problem exists, AND that the psychiatric establishment simply refuses to acknowledge it. DTD/C-PTSD is no fantasy. We see and treat these people, as children and adults. They exist, and they are nothing like ""ordinary"" PTSD treatment clients.

Part Four (29 pp) focuses on memory. I've long thought that much writing on treating psychological trauma seems to miss the point: trauma memory is what causes the problem. Deal with that and the symptoms vanish. Why is this so hard to understand? Yet, it is not a common understanding at all. Explaining how trauma memory works is invariably enlightening to my clients. And experiencing what happens when we change the nature of trauma memory is revelatory to someone who's lived with it for years, if not decades. As he does throughout the book, van der Kolk offers fine stories about clients who have experienced exactly what I've seen happen in my clients, making excellent use of what cognitive research tells us: people understand things best through narratives. Offer a good narrative and you convince.

Psychological trauma therapy is complex, but we are now well prepared to launch into the book's core content - Part Five (154 pp), ""Paths to Recovery"". He gets right to it: we cannot undo the trauma, but we CAN undo its effect on us, and so get our ""self"" back. Ch. 13 reviews existing therapies. His approach is to repair ""Descartes' Error"" (see Damásio's 1994 book of that title) by viewing mind and body as a single coherent functional unit. His topical coverage is complete and his critique of current therapies acute - not to be missed.

He then writes of the importance of language (Ch. 14). We construct our narrative mainly in words, and the words we choose are critical. But language is not enough (this anticipates his next two chapters). Our senses encompass a larger world, and it's center is our body, where all our sensory receptors are located. Then he introduces the treatment model he's long advocated: EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). I'm trained in EMDR, and in fact van der Kolk and I had the same instructor for our advanced training: Gerald Puk PhD. Van der Kolk tells an amusing and self-deprecating story about his advanced training experience, in which Puk was able to provide a strong corrective to his approach to clients. This is typical van der Kolk - he's a truth-teller, even when it may put him in a poor light! And,after all, at this point he has nothing to prove to anyone.

Finding an EMDR therapist is not hard (see his ""Resources"" section). Nor is it hard to find a yoga instructor, and yoga is what he advises for helping a trauma victim get back into their body. Yoga is a wise choice, because it is available, already widely known, and adaptable to a wide range of individuals and capabilities.

There is much more in Part Five, and the focus is on self-empowerment. ""Victim no more!"" as they say. Most trauma therapists have a keen interest in seeing their clients leave therapy charged up and ready to fully embrace their life - that certainly is my own emphasis. Van der Kolk's thoughts on self-empowerment for those in recovery from psychological trauma will be invaluable to any trauma psychotherapy client.

For psychotherapy professionals, this book will be both delightful and confirming. For everyone else, it will be a readable, gripping, highly educational tour of topics all of which are critical to a successful transition back from the impact of psychological trauma. That he gives prominent though not dominating emphasis to developmental trauma disorders is entirely appropriate. Our society has yet to grasp that child abuse and neglect is a more often chronic than not, and that its impact is largely ignored and poorly treated, if at all. This does not have to be. Get educated (this book will do that), then commit to being an advocate for children as well as for adults impacted by trauma. They all deserve the chance to be healed, and we can now do that. Van der Kolk shows us how.

It was widely known then that diagnosing a person’s mental states was not as precise as diagnosing a broken leg. Fast forward just three decades later, and that humility as transformed into hubris. The language of the DSM has permeated every facet of our culture with a kind of religious authority: This person is a narcissist; that one is bi-polar. Informal diagnoses abound, as pop psychology articles on the Internet aid and abet an army of armchair psychologists. Professional practice fairs little better: Most talk therapy, regardless of it’s flavor, rarely gets to the heart, or more precisely, the body of the matter.

When six months of discussion one hour a week doesn’t yield results, the next action is usually a diagnosis, the treatment of which requires a pharmacological solution. The drugs often do not work, and in the case of SSRIs among others, these medicinal interventions have been shown to be outright harmful to the patient. Big pharma’s profits soar, and the patients remain unwell or worse than when they started treatment.

In this environment, Van der Kolk’s work is needed now more than ever. Many of the DSM diagnoses are various flavors of how trauma is manifesting itself in the patient. Trauma is not stored in the linguistic parts of the brain and body, and it therefore must be treated by means others than the linguistic talk-therapy approaches, and not masked with drugs. Van der Kolk takes readers on an exploration of a new landscape of treatment that involves yoga, dance, meditation, and theater, right along with EMDR and neurofeedback, among other newly-researched treatments.

I highly recommend this read for anyone who is interested in advancements in the field of psychology, or anyone who is questioning the path of treatment that they or a loved one is currently following.",positive

254,Audible Books & Originals,"The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"I want to give this book 3.5 stars, but because I think the knowledge in this book is important for the average person to read, I’ll give it 4 stars. I want to preface that the epilogue to this book (“Choices to be Made”) is an absolute trash-ridden, garage-filled piece of detritus that doesn’t belong anywhere in any sort of literature. It almost convinced me that this author is an absolute shill. However, if one ignores that entire last chapter, then the book itself is actually quite superb (and the author doesn’t seem to be a fraud).

Trauma is a huge problem in the world. Many subjects in the modern era have really advanced in order to better understand the human brain, mind, and the processes connecting them (mainly due to technological advancements such as the fMRI). I would think that to most people, trauma is something that can detrimentally, and sometimes irreversibly, harm someone. If that someone is a child, this damage is multiplied by a billion. However, what I think that people end up lacking is the knowledge of when/how trauma can form. It isn’t just caused by obvious phenomena such as war, natural disasters, tragic family accidents. It can be caused by simple things as well such as verbal arguments, falling off a bike as a child, or a parent working long hours and never seeing his or her child. This is why this book is important. It makes it known that trauma is a lot (or can be a lot) more ubiquitous than people think.

The book is broken down into a few sections. I would say about 70% of this book is background, on a variety of subject matter. This certainly could have been shortened down by about 40%, but I suppose more information is generally better (in this case I would likely disagree, as the book itself is already too long, so removing the “fluff” would likely have been a good idea). The last 30% of the book is about “solutions” to trauma. I won’t go into each chapter and mention every main point, but overall each chapter is worth, at the very least, a heavy skim

The background knowledge on trauma is really interesting. We learn what parts of the brain are activated during trauma (and parts that are activated post-trauma). This help us to understand why people may “freeze” during a traumatic experience, why people cant express their feelings when they become “triggered”, and why certain medications work better than others. The information here really opened my eyes as to why people who have experienced trauma can act so strangely and illogically. “Just tell me what emotion you are feeling.” “Stop trying to hit me! What the hell do you think you’re doing?” I feel like I can sympathize more with these people and have a better understanding of how to approach them.

The solutions to this were quite impressive and honestly seemed fairly simple in nature. Examples include EMDR (which is essentially just a mixture of hypnosis and REM sleep initiation), brain-computer interface technology to control frequencies produced by your brain, talking, yoga, theater, etc. There is no cure-all method, but rather each solution needs to be tailored to each individual. Obviously, drugs are an option here but this merely is a temporary solution and doesn’t “fix” trauma at all.

I want to finish this with my negative opinions on this book and the author. Overall, the author seems to be fairly knowledgeable and truly caring. However, this book is full of their bias, and it really shows. A few examples are as follows. The author does a good job at adding references in this book when making claims, but when you pay attention to the location of the references, it is clear that the author is tacitly picking and choosing what they need to reference. For one, the author really hates drugs (and by that I mean medications used to treat people with mental disorders or trauma). He makes that very clear throughout this entire book. So he will reference some statistics that say drug use is bad when he makes a claim. But then a few sentences later he makes another claim that negatively talks about drugs, but doesn’t cite any reference. He tries to make you think that the reference 3 sentences ago would also be for this, but in reality it doesn’t. I see this as pseudo-science. He thinks he is being clever but in reality he is just being a biased con artist and not even close to a real scientist. As I mentioned early, the epilogue to this book is just atrocious, This is where he gets into politics and tries to tie trauma to all sort of institutions and societal structures. He blames trauma on guns, healthcare, teachers, etc. He think that teachers are to blame (they dont comfort kids enough) and writes off the parents bad behavior at home as “something that happens, but the teacher needs to be the ‘parent’ then”. He paints the USA at times as some crazy country where schools and healthcare is years behind what it should be, but doesn’t talk about these same exact issues (sometimes even worse) in Western Europe where these political structures are different, but the problem still remains. I’m very happy this was an epilogue and not an introduction because if it was I would have thrown this book into my compost bin immediately if it was.",positive

So, this book changed my life. No, really. In fact, it’s *saved* it.

I have severe PTSD. And despite years of therapy, it seemed to be getting worse instead of better. My flashbacks were occurring more and more often. I was becoming more and more lethargic and frozen in time. And suicide was constantly just *there* in my mind. Constant. I’d even set a date.

And then my insurance quit paying for my therapy.

As a last, desperate grasp for help, I started to read this book.

I have never read anything more validating and more hopeful. To see the brain scans and hear the science that explained *exactly* what has happened to my brain, what is going on during my flashbacks and why I’m always physically sick—all the times I’ve gone to a doctor in pain or feeling like I’m having a heart attack or a stroke only to be told they can’t find anything wrong—brought me to tears. It gave me all the answers I’ve been searching for. It gave everything a scientific, medical explanation—and a path to *healing*.

He explained why all of my EMDR therapy wasn’t working—it was because my therapists (bless them!) were doing it wrong. And I’ve been able to take what I’ve learned from my therapists and this book and do EMDR on my own, and today... today I feel more like my old, genuine self, than I have in *years*. The shadow of suicidal thoughts no longer follows me. I feel *light*. And I have *hope*—genuine *hope*—that I actually *can* get better! I’m always telling people *they* can get better and there’s hope for *them*... but I haven’t felt that way about myself. Now, I do. I haven’t had that hope in a long, *long* time. And I even think, after years of struggling and finally making such great progress in such a short time, maybe—just maybe—I can be cured. I never thought I’d say that! The future is so exciting to me now!

If you have trauma, do be warned—Dr. van der Kolk talks a lot about his clients and their traumatic experiences and it can be very triggering. Some of the details I felt he definitely could’ve left out, honestly. However, the scientific information, the validation and the information on how to heal trauma, has made this book absolutely *priceless* to me. It’s my trauma bible. I’ll be re-reading it in the future and constantly referring to it.

Edit: I keep seeing reviews on here from people who were super upset by the story of the Vietnam vet who murdered a family, raped the mother and left her to die. Honestly, I flipped out at that part, too (aka, had a flashback), in large part because I misunderstood what Dr. van der Kolk was trying to say. I thought for a moment that he was trying to justify what the man did, and had to email my old therapist about it. Of course, she had the book and was able to read the scene. She encouraged me to reread his conclusion, and pointed out to me that he’s actually saying how difficult it was to try to treat him objectively because what the man had done was an absolute atrocity. He never actually justifies it. He calls it an atrocity. It’s just worded weird, and if you’re already triggered by what you’ve just read, it is *easily* misunderstood. I hope he clarifies this in future editions. You have to keep in mind that, van der Kolk’s target audience is actually other therapists. For this reason, it *was* difficult for me to read. I was violently attacked and molested at 5-years-old and repeatedly raped and abused as a teenager. His going over other people’s abuse is overly detailed at times and I had to skip many of those scenes.

However, I don’t hold any of this against him at all. The information in this book has changed my life, I feel seen and validated, and I stand by that almost a year after reading it. I keep it right on my writing desk where it’s easily found for reference. Am I cured yet? No. Did my flashbacks stop? Nope. This year has been an unexpected nightmare full of triggers. But I’ve made *so* much progress. And I have hope. And that’s what I need to make it through each day. I sincerely believe that, through a lot of work (which I’m willing to do!), I can be cured in time. And all of that started with this book.",positive

259,Audible Books & Originals,"The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma",$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"After being struck by trauma – combat, auto accident, assault, abuse – why do the dreams come and come and come? From where does the anxiety, distractedness, or outburst originate? Are there reasons for the gut balling up into a knot and the chest squeezing tight and feeling like it will implode when unwanted memories of the distress invade? Why does the recall come in pieces, chunks, or flashes? And then there’s the inability to communicate, the mental shut-down, the emotional-frigidity; what is that all about? Is there any way to move from the trauma and its aftermath to some sense of genuine wellbeing? All of these subjects, and more, are covered by Bessel van der Kolk, founder and medical director of the Trauma Center in Brookline, Massachusetts, professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine, and director of the National Complex Trauma Treatment Network, in his 464 page paperback, “The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma”. This volume is written for both the helping-professions technician and therapist, as well as for the traumatized and their families. With thousands of book reviews already posted and published, I’ll make this review brief.

“The Body Keeps the Score” unpacks the way trauma affects us, mind, brain, and body. The author looks at multiple forms of therapy, showing their strengths and limits. He recognizes that there are “fundamentally three avenues [of therapy]: 1) top down, by talking, (re-) connecting with others, and allowing ourselves to know and understand what is going on with us, while processing the memories of the trauma; 2) by taking medicines that shut down inappropriate alarm reactions, or by utilizing other technologies that change the way the brain organizes information, and 3) bottom up: by allowing the body to have experiences that deeply and viscerally contradict the helplessness, rage, or collapse that results from trauma” (3). Van der Kolk addresses each of these approaches while explaining in detail what harrowing ordeals do to people.

The author’s proposition through the pages is that the anguish of assault and abuse “changes brain development, self-regulation, and the capacity to stay focused and in tune with others…experiences change the structure and function of the brain – and even affect the genes we pass on to our children…devastates the social-engagement system and interferes with cooperation, nurturing, and the ability to function as a productive member of the clan” (349, 351). One of the aspects that surprised me was how the “ventral vagal complex” – the vagus nerve that interfaces with other nervous systems – takes what my brain is experiencing (even re-experiencing through PTSD, etc.) and mobilizes muscles, heart, lungs and other body parts, so that I feel the alarm – or helplessness – or grief in my brain all the way down into my chest and stomach! Which means my body begins to take on muscle-memory (as we put it in martial arts)! Therefore, if “the memory of trauma is encoded in the viscera, in heartbreaking and gut-wrenching emotions, in autoimmune disorders and skeletal/muscular problems, and if mind/brain/visceral communication is the royal road to emotion regulation, this demands a radical shift in our therapeutic assumptions (88). It’s this “radical shift in therapeutic assumptions” that dominates the authors final eight chapters, where he methodically explains different “paths to recovery”. This is truly a captivating read!

Van der Kolk weaves into the technical aspects of the book biographical and autobiographical tales that help the reader to see what has gone on, and not gone on, in the world of psychiatry and psychology regarding trauma. The stories also help to cement into the imagination and comprehension what he is trying to communicate. The book is reasonably technical with neuroscience, brain studies, physiology, professional acronyms and so forth. But the author is careful to not leave anyone in the dark. It is a fascinating read that treats the audience as mature enough to handle the subject and grasp the material. I disagreed with the evolutionary explanations of how the brain develops and found the little political rant in the epilogue disappointing. But beyond these, I was almost mesmerized by the book!

“The Body Keeps the Score” is a whole textbook on physiology, brain studies and neuroscience, as well as therapeutic theories. It is not a self-help book, but readers who are looking for help will likely find it beneficial. Helping professionals may also find it advantageous as the author has a plethora of notes on various studies and articles. But I think that the biggest value will be for those who have family members, friends, and parishioners that have been through violent experiences. It gives a bigger and better perspective on what s going on, and they will be able to draw from the various paths to recovery approaches they can take as they seek to be part of the remedy and not the trauma.

260,Audible Books & Originals,12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Jordan Peterson is a beacon of light in this chaotic world, a psychologist whose writing combines science and common sense. One of his talents is his ability to articulate complex ideas to a wide audience. Regardless of whether you have a background in psychology or not, you will understand this book. It covers his twelve rules for life, which are intended not only as a guide for life of the individual, but as a remedy for society’s present ills. Peterson believes that the cure for society starts with curing the individual, the smallest unit of society. Peterson’s well-known advice to clean your room is a reflection of the truth that if you can’t even manage the most basic and mundane responsibilities of life, then you have no business dictating to others how to fix society.

One of the main themes of this book is: Personal change is possible. There's no doubt you can be slightly better today than you were yesterday. Because of Pareto's Principle (small changes can have disproportionately large results), this movement towards the good increases massively, and this upward trajectory can take your life out of hell more rapidly than you could believe. Life is tragic and full of suffering and malevolence. But there's something you can start putting right, and we can't imagine what good things are in store for us if we just fix the things that are within our power to do so.

The 12 Rules for Life:

In Peterson’s own words, it’s 12 rules to stop you from being pathetic, written from the perspective of someone who himself tried to stop being pathetic and is still working on it. Peterson is open about his struggles and shortcomings, unlike many authors who only reveal a carefully curated façade.

Rule 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back. People have bad posture, and the meaning behind it can be demonstrated by animal behaviors. Peterson uses the example of the lobster. When a lobster loses a fight, and they fight all the time, it scrunches up a little. Lobsters run on serotonin and when he loses, levels go down, and when he wins, levels go up and he stretches out and is confident. Who cares? We evolutionarily diverged from lobsters 350 million years ago, but it’s still the same circuit. It’s a deep instinct to size others up when looking at them to see where they fit in the social hierarchy. If your serotonin levels fall, you get depressed and crunch forward and you’re inviting more oppression from predator personalities and can get stuck in a loop. Fixing our posture is part of the psycho-physiological loop that can help you get started back up again.

Rule 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping. People often have self-contempt whether they realize it or not. Imagine someone you love and treat well. You need to treat yourself with the same respect. Take care of yourself, your room, your things, and have respect for yourself as if you’re a person with potential and is important to the people around you. If you make a pattern of bad mistakes, your life gets worse, not just for you, but for the people around you. All your actions echo in ways that cannot be imagined. Think of Stalin’s mother and the mistakes she made in life, and how the ripple effects went on to affect the millions of people around him.

Rule 3: Choose your friends carefully. It is appropriate for you to evaluate your social surroundings and eliminate those who are hurting you. You have no ethical obligation to associate with people who are making your life worse. In fact, you are obligated to disassociate with people who are trying to destroy the structure of being, your being, society’s being. It’s not cruel, it’s sending a message that some behaviors are not to be tolerated.

Rule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today. You need to improve, and you may even be in real bad shape, but many unfairly compare themselves to some more seemingly successful person. Up till around age 17, random comparisons to other people can make sense, but afterwards, especially age 30+, our lives become so idiosyncratic that comparisons with others become meaningless and unhelpful. You only see a slice of their life, a public facet, and are blind to the problems they conceal.

Rule 5: Don't let children do things that make you dislike them. You aren't as nice as you think, and you will unconsciously take revenge on them. You are massively more powerful than your children, and have the ability and subconscious proclivity for tyranny deeply rooted within you.If you don't think this is true, you don't know yourself well enough. His advice on disciplinary procedure: (1) limit the rules. (2) use minimum necessary force and (3) parents should come in pairs.It's difficult and exhausting to raise children, and it's easy to make mistakes. A bad day at work, fatigue, hunger, stress, etc, can make you unreasonable.

Rule 6: Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world. Life is tragic and there's malevolence. There's plenty to complain about, but if you dwell on it, you will become bitter and tread down a path that will take you to twisted places. The diaries of the Columbine killers are a chilling look into minds that dwelled on the unholy trinity of deceit, arrogance, and resentment) . So instead of cursing the tragedy that is life, transform into something meaningful. Start by stop doing something, anything, that you know to be wrong. Everyday you have choices in front of you. Stop doing and saying things that make you weak and ashamed. Do only those things that you would proudly talk about in public.

Rule 7: Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient). Meaning is how you protect yourself against the suffering that life entails. This means that despite the fact that we’re all emotionally wounded by life, we’ve found something that makes it all worthwhile. Meaning, Peterson says, is like an instinct, or a form of vision. It lets you know when you’re in the right place, and he says that the right place is midway between chaos and order. If you stay firmly ensconced within order, things you understand, then you can’t grow. If you stay within chaos, then you’re lost. Expediency is what you do to get yourself out of trouble here and now, but it comes at the cost of sacrificing the future for the present. So instead of doing what gets you off the hook today, aim high. Look around you and see what you can make better. Make it better. As you gain knowledge, consciously remain humble and avoid arrogance that can stealthily creep on you. Peterson also says to be aware of our shortcomings, whatever they may be; our secret resentments, hatred, cowardice, and other failings. Be slow to accuse others because we too conceal malevolent impulses, and certainly before we attempt to fix the world.

Rule 8: Tell the truth—or, at least, don't lie. Telling the truth can be hard in the sense that it’s often difficult to know the truth. However, we can know when we’re lying. Telling lies makes you weak. You can feel it, and others can sense it too. Meaning, according to Peterson, is associated with truth, and lying is the antithesis of meaning. Lying disassociates you with meaning, and thus reality itself. You might get away with lying for a short while, but only a short time. In Peterson’s words “It was the great and the small lies of the Nazi and Communist states that produced the deaths of millions of people.”

Rule 9: Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't. A good conversation consists of you coming out wiser than you went into it. An example is when you get into an argument with your significant other, you want to win, especially if you get angry. If you’re more verbally fluent than the other person then you can win. One problem is that the other person might see something better than you, but they can’t quite articulate it as well. Always listen because there’s a possibility they’re going to tell you something that will prevent you from running headfirst into a brick wall. This is why Peterson says to listen to your enemies. They will lie about you, but they will also say true things about yourself that your friends won’t. Separate the wheat from the chaff and make your life better.

Rule 10: Be Precise in Your Speech: There is some integral connection between communication and reality (or structures of belief as he likes to say). Language takes chaos and makes it into a ‘thing.’ As an example, imagine going through a rough patch in your life where you can’t quite put your finger on what’s wrong. This mysterious thing that’s bothering you—is it real? Yes, if it’s manifesting itself as physical discomfort. Then you talk about it and give it a name, and then this fuzzy, abstract thing turns into a specific thing. Once named, you can now do something about it. The unnameable is far more terrifying than the nameable. As an example, the movie the Blair Witch project didn’t actually name or describe the evil. Nothing happens in the movie, it’s all about the unnameable. If you can’t name something, it means it’s so terrifying to you that you can’t even think about it, and that makes you weaker. This is why Peterson is such a free speech advocate. He wants to bring things out of the realm of the unspeakable. Words have a creative power and you don’t want to create more mark and darkness by imprecise speech.

Rule 11: Don’t bother children when they are skateboarding. This is mainly about masculinity. Peterson remembers seeing children doing all kinds of crazy stunts on skateboards and handrails, and believes this is an essential ingredient to develop masculinity, to try to develop competence and face danger. Jordan Peterson considers the act of sliding down a handrail to be brave and perhaps stupid as well, but overall positive. A lot of rebellious behavior in school is often called ‘toxic masculinity,’ but Peterson would say to let them be. An example would be a figure skater that makes a 9.9 on her performance, essentially perfect. Then the next skater that follows her seems to have no hope. But she pushes herself closer to chaos, beyond her competence, and when successful, inspires awe. Judges award her 10’s. She’s gone beyond perfection into the unknown and ennobled herself as well as humanity as well.

Rule 12: Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street. This chapter is mainly autobiographical and he writes about tragedy and pain. When tragic things are in front of you and you’re somewhat powerless, you must keep your eyes open for little opportunities that highlight the redemptive elements of life that make it all worthwhile. The title of this chapter comes from his experience of observing a local stray cat, and watching it adapt to the rough circumstances around it. Another thing you must do when life is going to pieces is to shorten your temporal horizon. Instead of thinking in months, you maybe think in hours or minutes instead. You try to just have the best next minute or hour that you can. You shrink the time frame until you can handle it, this is how you adjust to the catastrophe. You try to stay on your feet and think. Although this chapters deals about harsh things, it’s an overall positive one. Always look for what’s meaningful and soul-sustaining even when you’re where you’d rather not be.",positive
261,Audible Books & Originals,12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"My favorite scholar is the American Jesuit polymath Walter J. Ong (1912-2003; Ph.D. in English, Harvard University, 1955). Now, in the American Catholic subculture in the United States, it is customary to address celibate priests with the honorific title “Father” – for example, Father Ong. In certain other cultures around the world, the honorific term “Father” is also used to address specific men. Whether or not celibate priests always live up to this honorific title, they are supposed to stand as father figures to the faithful. In our Western tradition of philosophic thought, Aristotle as a real father famously wrote a treatise on ethics for his real son – after whose name the treatise is now known as the Nicomachean Ethics (University of Chicago Press, 2011).

In his new book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (Toronto: Random House Canada, 2018), the Canadian psychology professor at the University of Toronto and practicing psychotherapist Jordan B. Peterson presents himself as a father figure on a mission to instruct and enlighten perplexed young men who have grown up under the influence of the verbal ventilation of feminists against the so-called “patriarchy” (etymologically, this word refers to fathers) – just as the men’s movement of the 1990s attempted to reach out to perplexed young men. His writing style is chatty and meandering, but your guess is as good as mine as to how many perplexed young men are willing to read the 370 pages of his chatty and meandering text. But at least he is fighting the good fight against feminist zealotry – just as Paglia has in recent decades.

But so-called second-wave feminists and later feminists have excelled in denouncing the so-called “patriarchy” (i.e., father figures) in Western culture. Nevertheless, Father Ong tried to the best of his ability to alert feminists about the male agonistic (contesting) spirit in his book Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality, and Consciousness (Cornell University Press, 1981), the published version of his 1979 Messenger Lectures at Cornell University – but to little avail. Despite Father Ong’s best efforts, feminists of both the female and the male varieties have verbally ventilated against the so-called “patriarchy” for decades now.

Ong imagined his 1981 book to be a non-materialist’s contribution to sociobiology as pioneered by the philosophical materialist E. O. Wilson (1975). Even though Plato and Aristotle lived centuries before Darwin and others, including Wilson, formulated evolutionary theory, Plato and Aristotle understood that we humans are basically animals, but with a significant difference – we have human reason to direct our animal tendencies – later known as our concupiscible and irascible tendencies. In the Phaedrus, Plato uses the famous imagery of a charioteer directing two powerful horses pulling the chariot/body. The two powerful horses represent the strong animal spirits known as our concupiscible and irascible tendencies. Both Plato and Aristotle use the Greek term transliterated as “thumos” (or “thymos”) to refer to our animal spirit known as our irascible tendencies. But in Ong’s 1981 book, he does not happen to advert explicitly to Plato’s or Aristotle’s discussion of “thumos” (or “thymos”). Nevertheless, what Ong refers to as the male agonistic (contesting) spirit is a manifestation of what Plato and Aristotle refer to as “thumos” (or “thymos”).

Now, in general, Plato and Aristotle and certain other ancient Greek thinkers thought of virtue as the mean between extremes. Courage is the virtue that our animal spirit of “thumos” (or “thymos”) needs to become a pro-social force for fighting the good fight. The virtue of courage represents the mean between the extremes of pusillanimity and brashness. In today’s parlance, the virtue of courage represents proper assertiveness – not the extremes of non-assertiveness (passivity) and hostile assertiveness.

For Aristotle’s discussion of “thumos” (or “thymos”) in the political arena, see Barbara Koziak’s book Retrieving Political Emotion: Thumos, Aristotle, and Gender (Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000).

By the 1990s, certain men such as the American poet Robert Bly and the Jungian psychotherapist and theorist Robert Moore were concerned enough about the feminists’ verbal ventilation against so-called “patriarchy” that they attempted to start a men’s movement. With Douglas Gillette as co-author, Moore published five important books about the archetypes of the mature masculine (1990, 1992a, 1992b, 1993a, 1993b). But the efforts of the men’s movement were of little avail against the verbal ventilation of the feminists against the so-called “patriarchy.”

In the spirit of giving credit where credit is due, I should also give Camille Paglia credit for her spirited critique of feminist zealotry in her book Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson (Yale University Press, 1990) – but to little avail. No doubt the scholarly acumen that Paglia manifests in her book is impressive. However, her book is also sui generis. Not even Paglia herself has published a follow-up volume. But she has continued to inveigh incisively against feminist zealotry.

Because Paglia’s 1990 book is the revised version of her doctoral dissertation in English at Yale University, I would point out that Ong’s massively researched doctoral dissertation in English at Harvard University was published, slightly revised as the book Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue: From the Art of Discourse to the Art of Reason (Harvard University Press, 1958). Like Paglia, Ong subsequently never published such a thoroughly researched book. Incidentally, Peterson’s first book Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (Routledge, 1999) is thoroughly researched.

In Ong’s 1981 book Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality, and Consciousness, he discusses (pages 18-19, 25, 92, 100, 111, 115, and 148) the Jungian Israeli psychoanalyst Erich Neumann’s book The Origins and History of Consciousness (1954). In Paglia’s 1990 book Sexual Personae, she discusses (pages 42, 43, 47, 52, 88, 93, and 380) Neumann’s books The Origins and History of Consciousness (1954) and The Great Mother (1955). In Peterson’s new book, he also discusses (pages 323; 374, note 37; 387, notes 203 and 204) Neumann’s two most widely known books). In addition, Peterson discusses (pages 59-60, 180, 185, 188, 189, 193, 195, 198-199, 215, 288, 289-290, and 323) Jung extensively. In the endnotes, Peterson provides bibliographic references to Jung’s publications only twice (page 381, notes 134 and 139). However, in Peterson’s 1999 book Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, mentioned above, he refers to 15 of Jung’s specific publications (page 507).

Just as feminist zealotry is the predominant ideology of the Democratic Party in its zealotry for identity politics, so too anti-abortion zealotry is the predominant ideology of social conservatives in the Republican Party – which also includes economic libertarians. Feminist zealotry has been reinvigorated recently by the Harvey Weinstein affair and related down-sizing of certain other male sexual predators – but not of President Trump, the playboy sexual predator.

However, President Trump has also been criticized for being an agent of chaos, and Peterson claims that he has formulated 12 rules for life as an antidote to chaos – Trump. So with Trump’s chaos dominating news cycles, Peterson may get a hearing for his 12 rules.

With our ego-consciousness, we strive to establish order in our lives. But chaos can overcome us. When chaos disrupts our lives, we usually experience abandonment feelings. Our efforts to resolve our abandonment feelings aim to restore our sense of order in our lives. Because Trump’s chaos disturbs many Americans, those Americans need to work to restore their sense of order in their lives.

Nevertheless, the Americans who voted for Trump saw him favorably as a disrupter of the establishment order. Thus, even for Trump voters, Peterson’s contrast of chaos and order can work to characterize what they saw in him that enabled them to vote for him.

Put differently, the 2016 presidential election featured an electoral contest between two competing predominant orders, and similarly, between two competing senses of chaos.

But Peterson claims that he wants to see more people confront chaos in their own personal lives and somehow manage to work out a renewed sense of order in their lives. He sees all 12 of his rules for life as oriented to doing this. Consequently, in theory, both Democrats and Republicans might benefit from following his 12 rules for life.

Rule 1 is “Stand Up Straight with Your Shoulders Back” (pages 1-28). Peterson’s exposition of Rule 1 involves a brilliant account of evolutionary psychology. This chapter alone is worth the price of the book.

But Peterson’s account of evolutionary psychology should be complemented and further developed with Pete Walker’s account of our fight, flight, freeze, and fawn responses in his excellent self-help book Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving (2013). Because Ong’s book, mentioned above, is titled Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality, and Consciousness (1982), we should note that the title accentuates the fight response pattern delineated by Walker.

Peterson’s account of evolutionary psychology deepens our understanding of Vance Packard’s book The Status Seekers (1959). The developer Donald J. Trump exemplifies the spirit of alpha male status seekers. In contrast, Pope Francis exemplifies the Christian counter-spirit of certain other alpha males seeking to distinguish themselves through loving service of others. Basically, however, both Trump and Francis exemplify the fight response pattern that Walker delineates.

Rule 2 is “Treat Yourself Like Someone You Are Responsible for Helping” (pages 31-64). Basically, the helping spirit discussed by Peterson represents the fawn response pattern discussed by Walker. As Peterson discusses in rule 2, we often tend to help others far more eagerly than we tend to help and care for ourselves. But when we help others and ignore ourselves, we run the risk of experiencing burnout.

Rule 3 is “Make Friends with People Who Want the Best for You” (pages 67-83).

Rule 4 is “Compare Yourself to Who You Were Yesterday, Not to Who Someone Else Is Today” (pages 85-111).

Rule 5 is “Do Not Let Your Children Do Anything That Makes You Dislike Them” (pages 113-144).

Rule 6 is “Set Your House in Perfect Order Before You Criticize the World” (pages 147-159). But President Trump’s White House is not known for its order, but for its chaos. Both Trump and Pope Francis like to criticize the world.

Rule 7 is “Pursue What Is Meaningful (Not What Is Expedient)” (pages 161-201).

Rule 8 is “Tell the Truth – Or At Least, Don’t Lie” (pages 203-230). Ah, if only President Trump would tell the truth – or at least not lie!

Rule 9 is “Assume That the Person You Are Listening to Might Know Something You Don’t” (pages 233-256). I was really impressed with Peterson’s discussion of Carl Rogers’ account of interpersonal communication.

Rule 10 is “Be Precise in Your Speech” (pages 259-283). In Ong’s publications, he writes with precision – and concision.

Rule 11 is “Do Not Bother Children When They Are Skateboarding” (pages 285-332).

Rule 12 is “Pet a Cat When You Encounter One on the Street” (pages 335-353).

Peterson rounds off the text of his book with a “Coda” (pages 355-368). His book also includes a lengthy “Foreword” by Norman Doidge, M.D. (pages vii-xxiv), an “Overture” by Peterson (pages xxv-xxxv), “Acknowledgements” (pages 369-370), “Endnotes” (pages 371-389), and an “Index” (pages 390-409).

However, whatever merit Peterson’s 12 rules may have in the practical order, I would urge young men and women to undertake the three conversion processes that the Canadian Jesuit theologian and philosopher Bernard Lonergan (1904-1984) outlines in his philosophical masterpiece Insight: A Study of Human Understanding, 5th ed. (University of Toronto Press, 1992): (1) intellectual conversion involves their orientation to the intelligible; (2) moral conversion involves changing the criterion of their decision-making and choices from satisfactions to values (arguably similar in spirit to Peterson’s rule 7); and (3) religious conversion involves being grasped by ultimate concern (also known as God).

Regarding what Father Lonergan refers to as intellectual conversion, I would also call attention to Martha C. Nussbaum’s article “Human Functioning and Social Justice: In Defense of Aristotelian Essentialism” in the journal Political Theory, volume 20, number 2 (May 1992): pages 202-246.

People who do not experience what Lonergan refers to as intellectual conversion tend to live out their lives as tricksters dedicated to verbal trickery.

In conclusion, I admire Peterson for writing his new book as a father figure offering guidance for perplexed young men by setting forth 12 rules for life for them to follow. However, I think that Father Ong and Father Lonergan offer more salient and cogent guidance to young men and women.",positive
262,Audible Books & Originals,12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I took about a month to finish Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, in part because I wanted to slow down and try some of the advice in my life.

12 Rules for Life is an interesting book. Equal parts philosophy, psychology, and self-help book, it covers a broad range of topics, with Peterson drawing from life experiences, religion, and history to build a strong case for his points and provide what seems on its surface to be very good advice for people.

This is where Peterson's background as a clinical psychologist comes in handy. 12 Rules for Life is billed as an ""antidote to chaos"", and that is what its primary focus is. It's not great at helping you be more successful if you're disciplined and self-reliant already. As someone who always struggled with grasping the world, however, I found it very helpful.

Since I started reading this book, I lost 12 pounds, went from writing five hundred words a day to three thousand words a day, started waking up earlier in the morning consistently, and have been much happier.

Some of that is attributable to the fact that I was already willing to make changes, and many of the things I was doing were obviously bad ideas.

But there is something to be said for the lessons Peterson teaches. They are complicated, sometimes a little indirect, and mired in allegory. This makes them more valuable, if anything. Peterson doesn't use a magic formula, he uses principles of right action. This book provides general ideas and positions that can serve as a great tool to understanding how people think and why things go wrong.

Not everyone will agree with it. There is a chapter in the book where Peterson reflects on the fact that he has opportunities with clients where he could tell them one thing or another and their minds would make it to be total truth either way.

Perhaps that is what Peterson has done here: perhaps most systems like this are sufficient to improve lives if brought diligently into practice.

Or perhaps there is something to Peterson's words. His indictment of meaninglessness and his calls to purpose echo soundly throughout the book. There have been those who say that Peterson's calls for people to get themselves organized and his oft-mystical language is a cover for something sinister.

But I don't think they've ever really listened to him.

Approaching Peterson a skeptic, I was not sure that reading a book would have the power to change anything in my life. The first few chapters were met with nods, hesitancy, and the concession of points that sounded good. I wasn't hostile to him, and I found many of his points quite clever.

But when Peterson delved deeper into the archetypes and depth psychology I became suspicious. I had a moderate distrust of the Jungian method; I use it to teach literature, but I did not believe in using archetypes to assess personality.

Peterson's point is that we are all part of something great and interconnected. Because it is so massive, we need to be working to make sense of it. It won't happen automatically, and if we go for an easy explanation we may find ourselves walking dark, treacherous paths of misanthropy and rejection.

We are complicated pieces in an even more complicated puzzle. Peterson's approach is one of self improvement. When we take steps to sort ourselves out, we also need to enter a symbiotic process of bringing order to our world.

The purpose of this is not to achieve some sort of superiority. It is to achieve survival. The world will change, and we will be forced to adapt.

Peterson states that ""life is tragic."" His point is that people need to be ready to deal with adversity. Anyone can handle good times, because that's what we are able to rest and relax during. The true test of a person comes when they lose a loved one or a job or their health. They need to make a decision: what will they do in response.

Peterson uses haunting examples to illustrate what happens when this goes wrong. Using everything from Dostoevsky to the Soviet Union (and countless other insights from modern and historical figures), he creates case studies of what happens when things go wrong and people turn to dysfunction rather than improving their situation.

His 12 Rules serve as a guide on how to go from that point of failure to a point of redemption, offering a series of suggestions and guidelines to take a life that is becoming corrupted by hatred of the world and everything in it and turn it into a vessel for growth and self-improvement.

Is it a perfect guide to living life? No.

Is it helpful? Does it give insight to great truths? Yes.",positive
263,Audible Books & Originals,12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I've lived my first 18 years as an upper-middle-class millennial in an Asian Communist country. This is probably the only book that would make me lift my fingers away from the chaos of life to type an earnest review about it. Oh, how easy it is for peaceful humans with good intention to blindly follow destructive ideologies and behaviors. We all want to change the world for the better, yet most of us fail to improve our own mind, body, and relationships. As a black sheep from such Asian Communist herd, I myself have witnessed enough of people's naivety either in my home country or Western countries, and Dr. Peterson's book truly resonates with me.

One common thing among The 12 Rules for Life, in essence, is ""Honesty"".

Rule 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back (make your body/mind honest, straight and strong).

Rule 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping (be honest with yourself about your shortcomings and fix them)

Rule 3: Make friends with people who want the best for you (seek and keep honest, good friends).

Rule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today (focus only on your honest achievements).

Rule 5: Don't let children do things that make you dislike them (be honest with your kids about life, and prepare them for it).

Rule 6: Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world (be honest with the world about your shortcomings before bashing its imperfection).

Rule 7: Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient (live life being honest with your feelings).

Rule 8: Tell the truth—or, at least, don't lie (say only honest statements).

Rule 9: Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't (converse with an honest intention to learn).

Rule 10: Be Precise in Your Speech (make honestly condensed messages)

Rule 11: Don’t bother children when they are skateboarding (let less experienced people make honest efforts in risk-taking).

Rule 12: Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street (respect other beings - human included - that made honest efforts, despite how low their status is).

Asians living outside the US tend to do the opposite of Dr. Peterson’s rules. Especially under the Communist Party’s tyrannical grasp of free speech. Sure, we Asians can be quite intelligent and cooperative; but because of the traditional value system that favor group over individuals, Asians can be more predisposed to let the mob mentality win over the personal sense of justice and freedom. We don’t even speak up because our government would make life harder for everyone we know and love. But because of that, we’ve ensured a dishonest, dog-eat-dog society that is far darker and corrupted under the surface than most Western country.

We Asians often tell “white lies” to earn others’ favor. But when it becomes a habit and necessity for climbing the social ladder, every lie is white. Usually, bribery goes like this: “No, I don’t accept bribes.” - “Please, sir. It’s not bribery, just a gift from our heart.” - “I will reluctantly accept it, but no promise to give you favors.” - “That is totally fine, sir. We only worry about your health and family. To us, you are like family as well.” - “Yes, and family should help each other. That is the basic principle of a good society. Don’t you agree?” - “Yes, sir! We’ll be counting on you...”

What I have seen after living in Europe and America, is that the radical left of the Western political spectrum is (ironically) transforming into a totalitarian force in the name of “Anti-Everything-Evil.” They want the government to control the free conversation and wealth distribution, in the name of anti-racism, anti-sexism (prejudice against other genders), anti-misogyny (prejudice against women) or anti-bigotry (prejudice against different opinion, which is hilarious). But let me tell you: when it comes to limiting freedom of speech and distributing wealth from the “rich” to the “poor,” Communist Asians did a very similar thing, in the name of anti-colonialism, anti-capitalism, anti-fascism, etc. Nothing good came out of it.

What happened, and may happen if Western people don’t follow Dr. Peterson’s rules of honesty, is more chaos. Those who are incompetent and dishonest will become richer, those who are talented will only manage to live their lives relatively comfortable (unless they are willing to become corrupted), and the honest poor will become poorer. The Feminists who fight for free birth control pills are ignoring the fact that China fails to protect woman and child trafficking into sex-slavery. The Liberals do not see that high taxes drove companies big or small to China, destroying the livelihood of millions of their own honest and competent countrymen. Even the Libertarians who preach ""free market"" idea miss the notion of ""fair play"" when it comes to economic relationship with China. To me, such people are not so noble, anti-evil nor anti-establishment; they are just too selfish, naive or too simple-minded to criticize the world.

For the final note, as a long-time Star Wars fan, I'd rather spend my time rereading this book than rewatching the new Star Wars movie.

264,Audible Books & Originals,12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,3,"Jordan Peterson is a polarizing figure. In a world where extreme opinions become the norm, his matter-of-fact stance are often criticized by the liberals as dangerous ideas. Without ever reading or listening from himself directly I had thought that Peterson was just one of those provocative right wing commentators such as Rush Limbaugh or nut job Alex Jones.

But then I listened to a podcast interview with him, and the few little things he said have actually been fact-checked and deeply analysed before he talks, and actually makes sense. Then I watched some of the several controversial videos of him, and the many criticism of him seems like taken wildly out of context.

For example when asked in an interview by a feminist whether a transgender woman is a real woman, his answer was: depends on the definition, for instance according to the biological definition a real woman is someone who can produce babies, so in that regards transgender woman is not a real woman. A bold and harsh fact, one that perhaps is not politically correct to say in this hyper-sensitive era, which eventually gives him the label of transphobic without intending to do so (because he then clarifies that he supports the choice that transgenders make, but that was not the question, and from the look of it never the intention of the interviewer).

Still, I felt indifferent. Few years passed and then I stumbled upon yet another meme of Peterson accused of some controversial stance (controversial in the context of identity politics), with me proceeded to read one of the media articles covering it. And again it feels incomplete, so I listened to another (longer) podcast interview with him to figure out the man behind the controversy.

But no matter how much snippets about him that I watched, read, or listened to, I will never get the big picture, as the things that he said and the reputation that he end up having doesn’t seem to match. That is, I thought, unless I finally read his book. And true to my tsundoku-ist nature I just happen to already bought this book a while ago. And so, I decided to give it a go.

In a world where good causes become overblown and over-exploited by the so-called social justice warriors, where the very causes that fight for human rights and equality are suddenly used for extreme entitlement and to play victim - which makes quite a lot of liberal minded people become frustrated when looking at the reverse injustice -, Jordan Peterson seems to serve as some kind of a voice of the harsh truth, an orderly reason to the chaotic reality.

And this book, with all its flaws, represents his compilation of just this: 12 rules to bring back order to the chaos occurring in our personal world. Here are the rules:

1. Stand up straight with your shoulders back.
2. Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping.
3. Make friends with people who want the best for you.
4. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone is today.
5. Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.
6. Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.
7. Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient).
8. Tell the truth—or, at least, don’t lie.
9. Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don’t.
10. Be precise in your speech.
11. Do not bother children when they are skateboarding.
12. Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street.

Now, as you may have noticed, in a glimpse these rules look nothing more than a back-to-basics kind of self-help advice. And you’re absolutely right. The book turns out to be such a dull one for a man as controversial as Peterson. I had expected something more edgy just like his spicy talks and debates. Moreover, the elaboration of the rules oftentimes can get way offtrack from the theme of the rules, while at other times it is filled by only meaningless gibberish and cliches.

Only occasionally that we hit upon Peterson’s true nature that provide our judgements and biases with sobering cold shower of raw truth. But when it does, it’s mind blowing, like his theory of unspeakable primordial calculator, or his description of the evolution of lie, or his interpretation and elaboration of the story “There’s no such thing as a dragon.”

And so, as it turns out, Peterson is a fantastic speaker and debater, but he’s just not that good of a writer. In fact, if you only read the 12 list above, you wouldn’t miss that much. But, BUT, it’s maybe worth sticking with the book, skim read it if you must, as the occasional bursts of brilliance really live up to his reputation as a clinical psychologist and a former Harvard professor that was popular with the students. It is also provide a glimpse of Peterson’s private life, which he’s surprisingly quite open (even vulnerable) with the stories of his family, friends, even his dog Sikko, and what happened to his daughter Mikhaila, that could give us more puzzle piece of information to the big picture about this man.

All in all, like Peterson himself, is it hard to put a label on this book. Some parts are no doubt worthy of a 5 star, others a dull 1, while most of the stuff written here are a borderline between 3 and 4 stars. So, for a book with thin margins between good and bad, I thought I’d resort to pettiness: 3 star for the overall average, and most specifically for hating Elmo (“that creepy whiny puppet”). Oh, never ever change Mr Peterson.",fair
265,Audible Books & Originals,12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"While at times long-winded and ponderous, 12 Rules weaves together many foundational life strategies for personal growth, developing one’s empathy for others, and for one’s self. At no time would a reader be deluded into thinking that Peterson’s thinking is original or ground-breaking, but it is his unique, almost idiosyncratic, way of packaging many disparate, oftentimes ancient ideas and wisdom, into a modern context that makes this book successful.

Contrary to the myriads of journalists and academics who seem continually determined to misread Peterson (I daresay few others have been more uncharitably read than Peterson in recent years), Peterson actually demonstrates a commitment to balance in his work. While I would classify him more as a conservative than as a liberal, his approach is quite evenhanded as he notes the extremes of positions across a variety of topics from relationships, children, work, family, politics and biology. (I say this because while reading, one gets the impression that “chaos” is more a current concern for Peterson than order—whereas I feel that a liberal would fear “order” to a greater degree.) Indeed, while the subtitle of 12 Rules is “an antidote to chaos”—a phrase that has caused unreasonable consternation among many left-leaning elites—the entire premise of 12 Rules is that embracing chaos and order to varying degrees, depending on context, can actually be the key to finding purpose. That is, being unbalanced in one or the other brings out the dark side of human nature, stagnates, or worse, results in catastrophe and bloodshed.
For example, while Rule 6 (set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world) suggests a deep, almost religious faith in the legacy of traditions, conversely, Rule 11 (do not bother children when they are skateboarding) argues for an embrace of danger and risk in order for humans to grow and have purpose. This is not to say Peterson is internally inconsistent, but that he argues for a sort of Dao—harmony within the universe.

Another major theme in 12 Rules is adaptability: Peterson argues that current Western culture encourages a default to pointing outward as the source of problems—which he doesn’t deny can be very real—but rather, he notes how we fail to adapt, focus, adjust, and reframe these problems. Instead, we pretend that there are no monsters under the bed, no skeletons in the closet, and assume we know all we need to know as we spiral into depression, stagnation, or self-loathing. Because of this, Peterson sees humans as greatly susceptible to self-delusion which “warps the structure of Being”. Sacrifice, focus, confronting our fears—these all run counter to our “instincts”. Religion, traditions, order, he argues, are the structures that can assist us in our quest to tame our inner self and adapt to our changing environments. But, he cautions, that we must also not “play the tyrant”—returning to his emphasis on balance.

When Peterson sticks to his psychological, literary, and religious analysis, he’s very strong—ironically, it’s when he gets into politics, his naiveté shows through. If there’s one overall criticism of 12 Rules, it would be that he plays fast and loose with ideas he has less than mastery. For instance, he muddles Marxism and postmodernism into an odd ideological stew, never minding that nearly a century separates the two systems of thought, as well as distorting both into a caricature of what each is, never citing much breadth or depth in any of representative thinkers (for example, he argues Derrida as the “leading” postmodernist—a debatable claim-- never cites anything by him, and ignores Foucault altogether).

Similarly, it’s quite easy to see who Peterson is stuck on—Nietzsche, Solzhenitsyn, and Jung. And often, that’s where that “packaging” of 12 Rules feels a bit loose: he’s phenomenal at wrapping a great many ideas together in a clear, persuasive narrative undergirded by psychological theory. Conversely, it’s almost as if he refused an editor: it feels that he insists on delving into things HE wants to sound off about, rather than staying in his lane of expertise. In that manner, 12 Rules would a be a stronger book for a more discipline focus on psychological theory infused with religious and literary analysis, rather than flirting into brief forays into gender and political theory. (The irony in all of this is that it is Peteron’s political commentary that has made him famous and also this book).

Yet, considering all that it tackles, this book stands tall: there’s no shortage of tough topics discussed and Peterson treats these subjects with both rigor and empathy. Peterson should also be commended for his commitment to not indulge readers’ base emotions, but to encourage individuals to self-reflect. It’s trendy and nearly cliché in contemporary culture to tell people to “live their truth” and “be themselves”, but Peterson argues that such thinking is a trap of arrogance and self-delusion. It’s here that I think Peterson’s greatest contribution lies: encouraging us, and coaching us; to confront the darkness—whether in our environments or within ourselves—and that that specific journey of change, of transformation, rather than being incidental, is actually essential to life.",positive
266,Audible Books & Originals,12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I will admit this right off the bat. I knew nothing of Jordan Peterson, or any of his ideology before reading this book. I must have existed in a vacuum, as I merely picked this book up as it was given as an ""Amazon Recommends.""

Curious about the title, I purchased on impulse.

I am very glad I did.

I am not Jordan Peterson's ""supposed"" target audience. (I used supposed because I don't think he actually claims to have one).

I am a liberal, Asian, left leaning moderate with a background in philosophy, theology and film studies. I support the women's right movement, equal pay, and I find the Republican party of today rather distasteful for the anti-science movement they espouse.

That being said, this book spoke to me. It is not an easy read. I had to re-read chapters slowly to fully condense my thoughts. I agree with the critical review that stated you have to be intellectually equipped to really get the most out of this. I had to utilize my background in philosophy and religion to go beyond the surface of what the author was trying to say. This is not a book you can listen to at 2x speed on Audible and hope to retain anything, imo. You need to digest this.

That being said...

Peterson's deft weaving of theology, mythology, and just overall cogent arguments and viewpoints made me really respect and open up my mind to things I never fully thought about. I find it laughable that a Harvard professor/psychologist has been embraced by the ""alt-right"" when even a moderately close reading of this text repudiates all that they stand for.

Peterson is direct. He has opinions. I don't always agree with them. But he is genuinely expressing himself, and the belief that we should all try to be better. We should all try to be more compassionate, and most of all, we all should try to understand our humanity a little more each and every there.

There's no division in this book; there's just deep anguish at the current state of humanity and its capacity for evil. There's some exasperation at the way things are currently constructed in society that is in many ways lost. And most of all, there's compassion and a belief that if we all got together in a room and truly talked, the world would be a better place.

I would shy away from the noise around Peterson in the headlines, on Youtube, and in how the idealogues use him (or even his own personal media narrative) to justify their twisted beliefs. Don't let the fact that the ""Alt-Right"" has co-opted this man to make him a mascot.

Just read the book independently and make your own judgments. You'll be glad you did.",positive
267,Audible Books & Originals,12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Jordan Peterson has stirred up quite a bit of controversy, yet I didn’t think that this book was controversial at all. He’s a clinical psychologist and his aim in writing this book is to encourage improvement on an individual level.

Peterson is sharp as a tack. Be warned that this is not a simple self-help guide, nor is it an easy read. It’s a mix of psychology, religion, and history. Some of it was challenging and a bit over my head. I’d find myself going back and re-reading those parts. Mind you, even then, there were a few areas where I still felt a bit lost. There were also many parts that I highlighted, as you can see from my quotes below, and those are just some of them. My favorite parts were when Peterson would write about his family and experiences. There was so much wisdom there, particularly when dealing with his daughter’s illness, who had been in severe pain for eight years.",positive
268,Audible Books & Originals,12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"Pursue what is meaningful, not merely what is immediately expedient. Stand up straight and face the world with courage and confidence. Get your own life in order before you go out and try to save the world. Treat yourself like a person whom you are responsible for. Tell the truth.

These incredibly obvious pieces of advice are some of the aphorisms found in one of the biggest selling books of the moment: Jordan Peterson’s 12 Rules for Life. The success of the book and the “academic rock star” status it’s author has achieved recently suggest just how far we have gone off track in teaching the young about life, when such aphorisms come as revelations to many.

Still, 12 Rules for Life is a very good book, and one that many people could benefit from reading. Peterson, who has a vast network of followers on YouTube, is predominately attracting a younger male audience, and I suspect that the book will appeal mostly to them. I see his influence as being a positive development in the evolution of masculinity, as I argued in a recent blog post. Even I, as an older male, found much of value in the book. And women of any age could easily benefit from it as well.

One theme that runs through the book is that we need to teach responsibility to children by setting appropriate boundaries. We also need to let them play and explore the world, to make their own mistakes.

Now, given that so many of us adults had deficient parenting, we must teach ourselves such practical wisdom.

Contained within many of the author’s points are fascinating anecdotes and specific, practical applications. Peterson tells stories gleaned from his own life experience, as well as from his experience as a clinical psychologist. There is a lot of history to draw from. The tales keep the text alive, much as with his online videos.

Jordan Peterson’s background as a psychologist influences his teachings. He draws upon biology and evolutionary theory to help explicate many of his points. He famously compares human neurophysiology to that of the lobster, while making the point that we exist in hierarchies that are at least partly explicable as evolutionary patterns. His advice is then to “stand up straight”, following the example of the body language of dominant lobsters. But Peterson is no biological determinist, as his online videos show. He’s simply acknowledging that we humans are not merely ghosts in biological machines, whereby free will and culture determine all behavior.

Jordan Peterson draws from many religious and spiritual traditions to clarify and expand his insights, but most frequently from Christianity. One aspect of the book which I found challenging to navigate is the frequent biblical narratives. Using a Jungian approach (Joseph Campbell, if you prefer), some chapters in the book ramble a little, and could be made shorter. The connectivity between some points also sometimes seems unclear. Yet that could have been because I read quickly.

Having said this, the biblical allusions Peterson uses have reopened my mind to the Christian tradition. In mainstream, non-ecclesiastical circles, Christianity is often looked upon negatively. On the political left, it is typically criticized and distained, often at levels which would be termed bigoted if such scorn was directed at any other religion. Perhaps a more balanced perspective is required, lest we jettison entirely a formative wisdom tradition which has helped define us.

Peterson is a Christian, just not a fundamentalist one. He has made the valid point that much of the thinking and values which underpin western thought and legal structures are Christian. Many of the stories in The Bible, including the idea of God, are thus archetypal. They are deeply imbedded within our psyches, even if we do not identity as Christian. Still, it may take some degree of self-discipline for some to wade through the religious mythology.

In my opinion, a fair assessment of 12 Rules to Life and Peterson’s teachings should negate any fear of an impending Nazi apocalypse. The book is not heavily political, making only brief diversions into politics and ideology.

One reason why I feel he can be relied upon to responsibly mediate the current cultural divide is that Peterson is an advocate of introspection and shadow work – looking within the psyche to honestly acknowledge what lies within, no matter how dark. His book lays this ideal down clearly. We are all capable of descending into that darkness, and we must be vigilant to avoid the fate. Such honest introspection is precisely what is often missing from progressivism today, largely because it has established an attitude of moral superiority over opposing voices. This is one reason why it has betrayed many of its founding principles, and is often intolerant and authoritarian.

Western society has set far too many men adrift, chronically shaming males and defining masculinity via its pathological expression. 12 Rules for Life may help many men to find confidence and direction amidst this extreme turn. And for that we should greatly thank him. Of course, given the huge amount of publicity Peterson’s media appearances have generated, there are potential downsides to all this.

Peterson has become a father figure to many, as well as spiritual mentor. This is occuring in the context of a society which has severely shamed masculinity and devalued fatherhood. Relating to Peterson’s paternal qualities is a healthy development if expressed responsibly.

Yet it seems to me that some of his followers are projecting far too much responsibility onto Peterson for their lives. I call this “giving away your power.” It is a common issue in spiritual circles. Indeed, I would say that it is almost a universal phase of personal and spiritual development. I am no exception, and gave my own power away to one or two spiritual and psychological guides as a younger man. Still, it is to be hoped that those who do this will quickly pass through the phase and assume greater responsibility for their lives. After all, taking responsibility is a central theme in Peterson’s teachings.

In 12 Rules for Life, Peterson implores us to focus our intent, to find meaningful work and self-work in order to help make the world a better place. For that is the best way that we can move forward and develop lives of power and purpose. He does not promise utopia. He merely suggests that personal responsibility, meaning and purpose should form a central part of the life journey, regardless of the outcome.

And who can argue with that?

12 Rules for Life is imperfect, but I highly recommend it. It contains much wisdom and thought-provoking philosophy from one of the most courageous and influential thinkers of our time.

269,Audible Books & Originals,12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Jordan B. Peterson’s videos came up as recommended for me on YouTube, so I listened to him – and I really liked what I heard. One thing that he puts out blatantly in his videos – largely from his psychology classes – is that he is Jungian in his understanding and practice. I first read Jung in high school and have read a few of his books and think highly of his way of interpreting the world.

From this, I saw recommendations of what is actually his second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. I have now read it.

One thing to say up front – as I watched his videos, I wondered if he is a Christian. He speaks of the Christian Scriptures frequently and talks about the stories of the Old and New Testament as being myth to make a point regarding Being. I don’t know what he actually believes religiously, but don’t expect him to affirm the stories he used as historical.

As you can tell from the title, Peterson will present twelve rules. Peterson explains that this book began as a post he wrote on Quora answering the question, “What makes life meaningful?” (xxv).

Rule 1: “Stand up straight with your shoulders back.”

Peterson writes a lot about our similarities to lobsters – so be prepared.

“Standing up physically also implies and invokes and demands standing up metaphysically. Standing up means voluntarily accepting the burden of Being.” “To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, with eyes wide open” (27).

To confront the world and all that it throws at us, we must physically stand up with our shoulders back, and our Being will follow.

Rule 2: “Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping.”

We don’t belong to ourselves – we did not bring ourselves into Being. Thus, we owe it to the world to care for ourselves in such a way that we bring order out of chaos – for all our sakes (60-61).

Rule 3: “Make friends with people who want the best for you.”

“You should choose people who want things to be better, not worse. It’s a good thing, not a selfish thing, to choose people who are good for you” (82).

Rule 4: “Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.”

“…set up the following goal: by the end of the day, I want things in my life to be a tiny bit better than they were this morning.” And also set a small reward for yourself when you achieve it (95-96).

Rule 5: “Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.”

“Children must be shaped and informed, or they cannot thrive” (122).

Rule 6: “Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.”

Begin by stop doing what you know to be wrong (157).

Rule 7: “Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient).”

The pursuit of what is meaningful encourages our growth, redemption, and reconciliation (201).

Rule 8: “Tell the truth – or, at least, don’t lie.”

“Untruth corrupts the soul and the state alike, and one form of corruption feeds the other” (215).

“In Paradise, everyone speaks the truth. That’s what makes it Paradise” (230).

Rule 9: “Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don’t.”

Thinking is a dialogue between two people (241). You need to listen and be able to summarize the other person’s view (246).

Rule 10: “Be precise I your speech.”

Without precision, you don’t know if you are going towards chaos or where you want to be (282-283).

Rule 11: “Don’t bother children when they are skateboarding.”

The removal of risk is detrimental to the growth of humans – especially boys. And it makes people much less willing to take responsibility (331).

Rule 12: “Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street.”

Cats are a manifestation of Being “in an almost pure form” and can give us joy in the midst of suffering – if but for a moment (353).

Next follows a “Coda” in which Peterson takes his twelve rules and answers primary questions about what one should do with their life … and so forth.

The book ends with acknowledgements, endnotes, and an extensive index.

Do I totally agree with Peterson? Absolutely not. There are a number of times when he gives a Jungian interpretation of something from the Bible and he is way off – and I find it annoying. Nevertheless, the book as a whole, and his rules, are excellent guidance for anyone who wants to lead a meaningful, worthwhile life that tends to avoid chaos and suffering, which is why I highly recommend it.

270,Audible Books & Originals,How to Win Friends & Influence People,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"I would like to begin the review by stating I have always found the title of this book incredibly off-putting. I understand that it is meant to draw a customer’s attention, but the title, to me, does not at all represent the product. This book is not a self-help book for people who want to make friends. It is a book that reiterates the basic tenants of leadership in a work environment. Point being, don’t let the kitsch title keep you from giving this book a chance, there is good information here.
My father handed this book to me when I was a young adult and I was about to make the leap into the working world. He told me that it held the keys to effective leadership. I bucked against reading it for a while before finally relenting (I was a precocious teenager and obviously already knew everything the world had to offer), and again, the title of the book seriously repelled me. Since initially relenting, I have now read this book multiple times throughout the years, and it never fails to pull me back into reality.
From time to time I even find myself subconsciously summarizing Carnegie while hosting leadership training or while mentoring my workers. This almost always prompts me to pick the book back up again. (I really enjoy reading through all of the notes I've scribbled in the margins over the years. It's always an interesting dive into your own subconscious through the ability to see such a time capsule: what is basically a time-stamped example of opinions and the ever-changing priorities of your own ideals. That is neither here nor there though; my love for actual physical books as well as my preference for writing my responses and opinions all over the pages is not really relevant to this review. Just a tangent.)
What I find so intriguing about Carnegie's concepts are that they are so obviously all just common sense. There are absolutely *zero* revelations here. You will learn nothing new about interpersonal relationships, leadership, or mentorship; every new chapter that you embark on is so 'in-your-face' obvious that you almost want to smack your own forehead like an over-dramatic soap opera star; stating ""OF COURSE"".
Despite this fact; (I personally feel) it really is important to read all of these *truths* of life... ironically enough, exactly because they are such common sense statements:

** The ""well, duh"" aspect of Carnegie's ""rules"" is the very same trait that allows us to breeze right on past them in our daily life. **

Because every single one of these ""rules"" is a statement that we all assume to be an innate and universally understood fact of human life, they are never actually in the forefront of our minds. This means that they become almost immediately forgettable because we already understand them to be true - and therefore we assume that they already inform our behavior; but in reality, we have simply acknowledged them as truth and stuffed them into a tiny little corner of our memory.
Reading Carnegie's book shines a spotlight onto that corner, blows the mounds of dust off these ideas, and prompts us to compare our recent behaviors against these ""known"" truths.
This is the reason why I have read Carnegie's book so many times. For me, it almost feels like re-orienting your personal compass. No matter how many times I pull these rules to the forefront of my consciousness, because of their nature as such obvious truths, they always subtly begin to slip back into the recesses of my mind. I like to pull out this book every so often and give my brain a nice jolt. There is no need to even sit down and read the entire book at once, it is organized as a list that is already categorized into sections relative to specific sub-tasks involved in interpersonal communication.
“How to Win Friends and Influence People” is one of Warren Buffett’s favorite books, so if you’re a working professional that’s probably enough to pique your interest. It was originally written in 1937 and draws key wisdom from the lives of Abraham Lincoln and contemporary psychology of the time, namely the works of Sigmund Freud. Despite this, the information remains relevant - which I find to be quite a feat. Many of the statements Carnegie makes are actually reminiscent of Skinner’s operant conditioning, although I don’t believe he ever outright states this.
To give a brief summary, the book is broken into segments titled: “techniques in handling people”, “ways to make people like you”, “win people to your way of thinking”, and “be a leader: how to change people without giving offense or arousing resentment”. Each of these segments includes chapters that explain the subsequent “rules” and provide interesting examples. Again, I would like to point out that this is not a book for people looking to make friends; despite one of some of the segment titles, such as: “ways to make people like you”, it does not preach methods of fostering friendships - instead this particular segment is pertinent to leadership because of Carnegie’s statement earlier on that: people will never do anything unless they actually *want* to do so. This is a truth of life; you can use your position of power to compel (force) a person into completing a task, but unless you create an actual want or desire within that person, they will cease their actions as soon as that power is removed (or you turn your back). Thus, the segment about making people like you provides rules that are geared toward earning your worker’s trust and respect so that they actually want to work for you, vice using your position of power to essentially strong-arm them into doing your bidding.
Here are the segments and rules:

Techniques in Handling People:
Don’t criticize, condemn, or complain.
Give honest and sincere appreciation.
Arouse in the other person an eager want.

Six Ways to Make People Like You:
Become genuinely interested in other people.
Smile.
Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.
Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.
Talk in terms of the other person’s interests.
Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely.

Win People to Your Way of Thinking:
The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.
Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, “you’re wrong”.
If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.
Begin in a friendly way.
Get the other person saying “yes, yes” immediately.
Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.
Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.
Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.
Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires.
Appeal to the nobler motives.
Dramatize your ideas.
Throw down a challenge.

Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment:
Begin with praise and honest appreciation.
Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.
Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.
Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.
Let the other person save face.
Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”
Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.
Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.
Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.

Again, this all seems like common sense when you read it, but in practice it does become much more difficult to stick to - especially when you personally are put-off (or simply just dislike) one or some of the people that you work with on a daily basis. It’s also difficult to remember that you are not always the person in the position of power; often you are on the other end of these situations and must give up the controlling position in the conversation - let them lead.
It’s key to keep in mind (and Carnegie reiterates this) that no matter what situation you walk into, whether you are the person who is leading the change, or whether you are the person who needs to undergo change, the person with whom you are conversing ALWAYS believes that they are superior to you in some way. It does not matter how exceptional or horrible their work performance may be, they truly and sincerely believe that they are the superior person even if they do not state this, and even if they pander to you as if you are someone they look up to.
Carnegie also emphasizes how important it is to avoid arguments. He states that even if you “win” an argument you are still the loser. The results are all negative. You never want to humiliate a person, you will loose the trust and respect that you’ve worked to build. He quotes and old saying “A man convinced against his will/Is of the same opinion still”; meaning they may relent in the moment, but in actuality you may have solidified their original opinion by putting them in a position to defend it. Its quite difficult to avoid arguments because it’s human nature to meet aggression with aggression - we have to consciously make the choice to sit back and let a person release their ill-will without meeting them there. Take that verbal beating!
The biggest point I always get from reading this book is how paramount and fragile the human ego is. It’s the driving factor behind the opinions and actions of every human on earth. At the end of the way, everyone is concerned with themselves. There are no truly selfless acts, someone is always “getting something” (fulfilling some need) from their actions, even if it is simply a feeling of importance or happiness. Every single person on earth is starved for attention and/or recognition in some way. They want to be seen, no matter if they are willing to admit this to others (or even to themselves). If you can fulfill that need for them, you’ve got them. It is so key to simply make it known that “I see you”.
Anyway, I know this is a long and winding review, but my points are thus: if you are looking for a self-help book that will provide teachings on how to make friends, this is not for you. If you are a working professional who is, or may be placed into, a position of leadership - this book is definitely for you. Even if you do not think you need any advice (because you’ve obviously already the best!), this book is priceless. It not only provides you insight into your own actions, but gives you a window into the actions and choices of those you work with/for. As stated, we are not always the main player in a situation, sometimes we are the person that this book talks about dealing with. Sitting back and letting the other person take charge (while understanding where they are coming from) also makes us better workers. Everyone is both a subordinate and a leader; everyone has someone else they answer to. A full birds-eye view of the situation can only provide us with more tools for our toolbox!",positive
271,Audible Books & Originals,How to Win Friends & Influence People,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"You can learn to be likable. That is the message of How to Make Friends and Influence People. The book explains how in easy to understand chapters.

Many who survived the teenage years may doubt that there is much moral significance in being liked. They attended high schools where the most accomplished bullies were often the most popular boys. The most popular girls were frequently Queen Bees and Mean Girls.

Fortunately, most people mellow out when they become grownups. Adults are rarely gratuitously cruel. Most adults respond positively to the methods Dale Carnegie teaches in this classic.

For years I felt condescending toward How to Win Friends and Influence People. When I finally read it I found it to contain common sense, common courtesy, and good mental hygiene. Dale Carnegie illustrates his points with quotes from some of the world’s greatest writers. Nevertheless, his book is easy to understand. He ends every chapter with one or two sentences that summarize the chapter.

The early chapters provide advice that works with most people most of the time. Smile. Be a good and sympathetic listener. Remember people’s names. “Give honest and sincere appreciation.”

Dale Carnegie insufficiently draws attention to the fact that in order to do well socially one often has to compromise between what one wants to do, and what is appropriate in the situation. Smile, even when you do not feel like smiling. Listen sympathetically to others, even when they are not fascinating conversationalists.

Dale Carnegie’s advice will be less congenial and more difficult to follow for those who can most benefit from it. This is particularly true for those with introverted personalities, like me. I enjoy solitude or the company of a close friend. Nevertheless, over the years, and with Dale Carnegie’s advice, I have learned to behave more like an extrovert in social situations. I do not mean that I become socially aggressive. I do mean that I make a point of listening to those who want to talk to me, and that I treat everyone with courtesy and respect.

I will never brighten a room by entering it. I will never be the life of a party. I have learned to avoid needlessly alienating people.

It is always a good idea, especially with people you don’t know very well, to let them do most of the talking. With people you do not know well it is probably a good idea not to introduce topics into the discussion. Instead, occasionally contribute to topics already raised to demonstrate that you have been paying attention.

Dale Carnegie likes to quote famous people. He ought to have included two quotes from Calvin Coolidge. “I have never been hurt by what I have not said,” and, “No man ever listened himself out of a job.” I wish I had heard and headed that advice earlier in life.

Dale Carnegie’s advice on how to win friends is better than his advice on how to influence people. It is difficult to change attitudes. You should not always try. You should never try to get someone to do something that is in your interest, but not in the other person’s.

This certainly includes asking for a raise. A good relationship with your immediate supervisor is usually the most important single factor in a job. If your boss is an employee like you are he or she only has so much money in the budget for raises. More for you means less for others. Even if your boss owns the company, asking for a raise will probably harm your relationship with him or her.

The first part of Dale Carnegie’s book is about being liked. It will work with most people most of the time. The second part is about influencing people. It will not always work. It will not always work for everyone. You can know how to do something and still not be able to do it.

Dale Carnegie presents two examples of a young man who got a well paying job with a self made millionaire by telling the millionarie how much he admired him for rising from poverty to wealth. I have read How to Win Friends & Influence People five times. I still could not do that. I would be better off if I could, but I could not.

I could express my admiration of someone who was picked on as a teenager by high school bullies, took martial arts lessons, and became an accomplished martial artist. I could express my appreciation of someone who never finished high school, but who became widely read and well informed in public libraries. In these cases I would neither ask for, nor would I expect any reward, other than the friendship of two fascinating individuals.

Dale Carnegie devotes much of his book explaining how bosses can get better performance from their subordinates. Other than explaining how to win the affection of others, he gives no advice on how to deal with an unsympathetic boss. Some bosses for reasons of their own will dislike you even if you try to be nice. A boss who does not like you will ignore your accomplishments, exaggerate the significance of your mistakes, and place you in situations where you are likely to make mistakes. Some will do this deliberately. Others will do it subconsciously.

My advice for unsympathetic bosses, and Dale Carnegie does give this this advice generally, is first of all do not argue with your boss. If he or she reprimands you, sit there and take it. Be aware, as painful as this may be, that some of your boss's criticism may be valid. Second, try to understand why the boss is the way he or she is. Try to understand how it feels to be that person.

Additionally, and this is my advice, avoid expressing hostility for the boss to a co-worker unless you know the co-worker feels the same way. You do not want your boss to learn from the grapevine that you think he or she is an incompetent bully who owes his or position to office politics, even if this is obviously true.

Dale Carnegie advises his readers to read each chapter twice, and to try to use everything he advises. What has worked for me has been to read the book straight through every few years or so. Also, I try to have a sense of what will work for me, and what will not.

The book is not infallible. It has been benefited me. Over the years, and largely as a result of reading this book, I have acquired a personality that enables me to be liked by people with whom I do not have anything obviously in common. Some people never acquire this ability. My life would be better if I had acquired it much earlier.",positive
272,Audible Books & Originals,How to Win Friends & Influence People,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"This was the first personal development book I ever read at age 12. Being a depressed, lonely child with few friends I came across this book by accident at my local library. I remember searching on the computer's library catalog: ""how to get friends"", and this was the book that came up. Little did I know this book was going to essentially become a Bible for me in developing my social skills throughout my adolescence.
.
I took this book with me everywhere I went, including on my camping trips with the Boy Scouts. At first glance, you may read the principles in this book and go: ""this is just common sense"". But you may have also heard the quote: ""common sense isn't common"".
.
How many of us actively make an effort to genuinely smile and be empathetic towards others? How may of us jump to criticizing others without considering the other person's point of view? How many of us condemn others without remembering it won't make the other person want to change their mind?
.
This book, without hyperbole, really changed my life! And while the book does have an aim towards business and sales people, as a teen the ideas still really resonated!
.
Seeing some more recent reviews on this book, I am genuinely surprised at the cynicism, one going so far as to call the book ""tools for manipulation"". The way I see it: this is a book with tools to develop your social skills. As with any tool, it can also be used and abused. It can make for a very effective leader as well as a very effective tyrant. Both Warren Buffett and Charles Manson have cited this book's tools, each of them being on very opposite sides of the moral spectrum.
.
Add to that, the author himself says multiple times in the book not to treat his principles as a ""bag of tricks"". At many points he emphasizes these tools must be used in an honest and genuine manner. If you're going to smile, you got to genuinely find something to smile about. If you're going to praise someone you need to sincerely find something you can praise. If you're going to express appreciation, you need to honestly find something to express appreciation about.

273,Audible Books & Originals,How to Win Friends & Influence People,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"Dale Carnegie is often cited in many “social skill” books, so its one of the primary sources on this subject. Highly recommended.
However, this book may be challenging to read for some people because it was written decades ago, when not much hard data on this subject was available. So the book is full of anecdotic evidence, examples and stories of a friend of a friend. Not that this make the advice less truthful, but it often need to tell 3 stories before arriving to the idea.

274,Audible Books & Originals,How to Win Friends & Influence People,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"In my honest opinion, several principles in this book are repeated around the book. I don't see it as a disadvantage, because repetition is the key to learning. I did think several of the principles explained in the book are common sense, but I found that it could be easy for a person to react quickly to conflicts. This book has taught me the importance of staying in control and how beneficial it is to be in control of our behaviors and act in a way of service to others. The examples described in the book made it simpler to understand the concepts that Dale is teaching. I recommend this book if you would like to improve your skills with people. This book is especially beneficial for those who are working on their businesses and close relationships.

This book is divided into four parts. The first half of the book discusses techniques in handling people and how to have people like you. The final half of the book gives instructions about how to win people to our own thinking and how to be a leader by changing people without offending them or causing resentment.

In the first part of the book, it is divided into three principles. The first principle emphasizes the importance of avoiding criticism and he describes working with people as: working with people of logic. He further describes complaining and criticizing as a foolish task to do and how it takes a person of character to understand, forgive, and have self-control. Principle # 2 describes the importance of honest and sincere appreciation. Within this principle he describes the importance of ending our own thinking of accomplishments and desires. Instead, we must put our focus on the other person's good qualities. If being sincere, this will cause people to cherish them in their minds, even years later. The third principle involves influencing the other person to want, but not in a way that is manipulative. With this principle, he describes the importance of self-expression and connects it to the importance of thinking in terms of the other person, so that they come up with your ideas on their own, which they will like more.

Within the second part of the book, it teaches six principles. The first describes how critical it is to become interested in other people because you will make more friends compared to having others interested in you. When he moves onto the second principle, he explains the importance to smile in a heartwarming way because it will brighten the lives of those who see it. Dale then describes the importance to recall a person's name in the third principle. He gives tips on how to remember and then explains how people enjoy the sound of their own name. The fourth principle is about being a good listener and encouraging those to talk about themselves. He then goes onto to explain again that people are more interested in talking about themselves instead of others. He further explains this point in principle five: Talk in terms of the other person's interests. The final step is to sincerely make the other person feel important because this is the ""deepest urge in human nature.""

Dale describes in the third part of the book the steps to have a person think in terms of your own thoughts. He then explains that it is better to avoid arguments and to show respect for other people's opinions and never tell them they are wrong. because it will further push them away. If there is fault in your own behavior, Dale explains to immediately admit you're wrong without any doubts. If you are upset, he explains to sit down and counsel together, and if there are differences, understand it. Even in some differences, there will be points of agreement. He then explains the importance of agreement and having the person say ""yes,"" at least twice. You doing this by looking into the other person's viewpoint and asking questions that cause them to agree. It is essential to have friends do the talking and have them excel us, instead of excelling them. When this occurs, they will feel important. To further the notion of feeling important, it is important to have the individual create their own ideas. He deepens this idea by asking questions such as, ""Why should he or she want to do it?"" and then being sympathetic towards their ideas. In order to catch a person's attention, you must dramatise the ideas you have. If all else fails, he explains the importance of competition and how it drives people to feel important and empowered to work efficiently and effectively.

In the final part of the book, Dale again discusses the importance of beginning with praise and honest appreciation. When someone makes a mistake, call to their mistakes indirectly. This can be done my making their mistakes your own and explaining the importance of fixing it and why it gave you a disadvantage. He then explains the importance of asking questions that direct the person you’re speaking to, to obtain your idea on their own. He emphasizes the importance of having the person be saved from embarrassment, and then explains the importance of praise again, even if it is small. Dale then gives examples of giving a person a reputation that makes them better, in order to have the person be motivated to improve. After giving someone a reputation to live up to, encourage the person to correct their faults and make them happy to do the actions you suggest.",positive

280,Audible Books & Originals,Breaking History: A White House Memoir,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Jared Kushner author’s this book… the same way he became way more than the President’s son-in-law. There’s a reason he became the President’s top adviser… on everything from how to maximize social media in planning untold strategies… to brokering multiple middle-east peace deals… that every other historical high ranking and leveraged figure never could! This young man is extremely straight forward… as well as intelligent. He knows when to say no and why… and unlike countless failed negotiators and Kings… Princes… Presidents… Vice-Presidents… et al… he knew when to ask questions… AND LISTEN… in situations that few others did.

This story of what it was truly like behind the scenes of Donald Trump’s election and time in office is laid out in such a smooth… intelligent… no-holds-barred format… that the four-hundred-fifty-plus-page book (plus pages of crisp clear color pictures… with interesting historical footnotes) will be read with the type of interest that will make you want to slow down and re-read a few passages as you go… to fully absorb accurately what you just learned… because as sure as I’m typing this review… you’re going to want to quote and discuss these “gems”… WITH FRIENDS AND FOES ALIKE!

The author… in my opinion makes a great decision on what he covers right off the bat. If a potential reader is not aware… his Father was convicted and sent to prison by then New Jersey U.S. Attorney Chris Christie. Jared’s family is extremely close and the years his Father was in prison obviously affected Jared for life… and is one of the reasons that along with the Middle East… prison reform and second chances were high on Kushner’s list right along with peace in the Middle-East. When Trump appointed Christie to head up his transition team… it was quite a dramatic moment in time when in a face to face meeting of all involved Trump said:

“SO, WE ARE GOOD THEN?

JARED REPLIED: “MY FATHER IS GOOD. BETWEEN CHRIS AND ME, IF WE’RE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER, I SHOULD EXPRESS THAT I FELT THE WAY YOU HANDLED MY FATHER’S CASE WAS OVERZEALOUS, AND IT BROUGHT SERIOUS HURT TO ME AND MY FAMILY.”

CHRISTIE EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD JUST BEEN DOING HIS JOB, THAT MY DAD HAD COMMITTED A CRIME, AND THAT IT WASN’T PERSONAL.

“WELL, RESPECTFULLY, I HAVE A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW ON THAT,” I SAID. IF IT WASN’T PERSONAL FOR YOU, THEN HOW COME YOU CHALLENGED MY FATHER’S RELEASE DATE AFTER HE HAD SERVED HIS SENTENCE? I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW BRUTAL IT IS FOR A FAMILY TO HAVE A LOVED ONE IN PRISON. THE ONLY SOLACE IS HAVING A DATE WHEN YOUR NIGHTMARE WILL END. WHEN THE PROSECUTOR COMES BACK AND CHALLENGES THE RELEASE DATE, AND IT GETS DELAYED INDEFINITELY, THAT’S DEVASTATING TO A FAMILY. SO DON’T TELL ME IT WASN’T PERSONAL, BECAUSE IF IT WASN’T PERSONAL, YOU WOULD HAVE LET HIM COME HOME ON TIME.”

“YOU KNOW, THE CRIME YOUR FATHER COMMITTED WAS TERRIBLE.” CHRISTIE STARTED TO SAY.

“THEN TRUMP INTERJECTED: “CHRIS, IT WAS A FAMILY DISPUTE.”

This is just a hint of the absolute “gloves-off-bare-knuckle” storytelling of recent political intrigue and… yes… HISTORY BREAKING! Calling a spade a spade as far as “leakers” and back stabbers such as…. Bannon… Tillerson… Priebus… Lewandowski… Manafort… and the total… spineless abandonment of Israel by the Obama administration… are laid out chapter and verse. Jared also makes the reader truly feel the stress and frustration of lives and political accomplishments put on hold or extremely weighed down by the disgusting phony Russian Collusion Hoax.

The author also shares and educates readers with his Grandparents escaping the Holocaust. The benefit of much of this early introductory narration… is that you can feel and start to understand not just what makes Jared tick… but what the whole of his soul… that he immerses into the opportunities he has to truly make the world a better place. Being that he always tried to stay in the background during the time he served our President and country… and was totally unlike ninety-five-per-cent of politicians who are “me-me-me”… and have ulterior motives… Jared like President Trump… didn’t need this job to earn money.

As someone who is constantly reading my entire life… a key to my enjoyment and my depth of education that I hope to get from each book I read… and how I rate them… is what I have come to call the “AUTHOR’S WRITING STYLE… HIS FLOW… AND… ARTISTIC SIGNATURE”. Unfortunately many authors have no real unique artistry… kind of like an orchestra without any instruments. I really enjoyed many things from Jared… one that I thought was “cute” and kind of endearing was the way… sometimes referring to Donald Trump…as… Trump… or… The President… or… my Father-In-Law… in natural ways based on the storytelling situation.

This is definitely not a “fake-news” kind of book… just trying to shock you… it truly comes across as a book that wants to educate you on the tumultuous period of time that it covers.",positive
281,Audible Books & Originals,Breaking History: A White House Memoir,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"*Note – I do not let political opinions affect my reviews. I review books based on the content, not the political affiliations of the authors. It is my opinion that more people should read books written by current or former government officials, even if you don’t agree with them, because it helps to better understand their perspectives, and get more insight into what is actually happening behind the scenes.

This book has 59 main chapters, with a total of about 465 pages. At the end of the book, after the Acknowledgements, Notes, and Index, there is a Photos section with 32 pictures. There are some pictures of Kushner with his family, and many of him with world leaders from different countries.

Kushner starts the book with a Preface that explains some of his motivations for writing this memoir, and what he hopes readers will get from it. Then in the first chapter, he recalls a pivotal moment in his life when his father was arrested in 2004, after a bitter family feud had resulted in unexpected betrayals. This was a dramatic way to start a book, as Kushner’s father was facing charges of transporting a prostitute across state lines after trying to set up his brother-in-law…

Throughout the early chapters of the book, Kushner covers some of the big influences in his life. He talks about his grandparents surviving the Holocaust, his experiences at Harvard, and his challenges as a real estate investor navigating the crash of 2008. He describes how he met Ivanka, when her father suggested she meet with him to discuss potential real estate deals. The conversations that he recalls seem very realistic, as you can almost hear Trump’s voice saying these things. These early chapters set the tone, as Kushner certainly has a knack for telling an entertaining story.

Kushner continues to recall his experiences as he describes the Trump campaign, conflicts with Chris Christie (who had prosected Kushner’s father), early days of the Trump administration, and his family’s decision to leave their New York lives and move to DC to officially work in the administration. He describes conflicts with Steve Bannon, and early struggles with trying to manage important negotiations and Trump’s tweets at the same time. As the book goes on, Kushner covers his experiences with Trump and world leaders, while also including parts that describe his family life and personal thoughts. There are many different publicized events that you get to see from a slightly different perspective, as Kushner recalls conversations and interactions that were never made public.

Overall, I found this book to be informative, but also at times surprising and fascinating. I really enjoyed reading this more than I thought that I would, and it has certainly given me a slightly different perspective about Kushner, and some of the other people he mentions in the book. Again, I must stress that you do not have to agree with all of his politics to appreciate this window into the behind-the-scenes interactions at the highest levels of government. There are valuable insights here, and I hope that people can overcome the modern political tribalism and try to absorb the information provided by such a rare glimpse into this world.",positive
282,Audible Books & Originals,Breaking History: A White House Memoir,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Jared Kushner has done an exemplary job of detailing his experiences serving the people of the United States and his father-in-law, Donald Trump, former POTUS.

Kushner, like Trump, is a business man; successful in his own right. Drawn into political service by way of marriage to Ivanka, he learns the ropes of D. C. and participates in some of the most successful political accomplishments of the last 50+ years: Abraham Accords, USMCA, Operation Warpspead, Criminal Justice Reform, Border Wall and more.

Contrary to the biased blast proffered by the NYT, Kushner is forthcoming with regards to his shortcomings and his fears. He readily admits to being a novice and openly discusses how he went about learning to navigate the inner sanctums and long serving members of Congress. Kushner uses his skills from business and lessons learned from family and faith to craft an hardworking persevering presence that earned him accolades from foreign countries and brave domestic individuals. Jared doesn’t get all snarky and partisan in this book but he does give specifics on who in the administration was friend or foe; very enlightening.

Unlike other memoirs I’ve read recently, this one has the benefit of more intimate relationships with Trump and the family, for obvious reasons. Kushner doesn’t use his family status as a club to pave the way or wield power for himself. It’s a driving force behind his ardent motivation and the level of insight that we readers are afforded in this engaging, conversational volume.

If you’re interested in greater details about the Middle East peace negotiations or the trade agreement between the USA, Mexico & Canada, this is a good read for you. There’s no politicking and no slandering and even the language is clean. Kushner served with his whole heart and soul, along with his wife, Ivanka.

I think Mr. Kushner wrote an amazing account of his experience not only in the White House but his life experiences which helped him very much navigate what is probably one of the most backstabbing, toxic environment a person could be in. I hope everyone enjoys this book as much as I have and gets a chance to see another side into this presidency…one that has been hindered since the day it began. We as Americans should demand the media and our government to provide us the truth, for so long it has been so dishonest that it has caused the division that we live in.

The contrast between the Trump administration and the current administration stand in stark contrast.

I would expect this type of book to emphasize the good that has been done and not tear into the president Trump. In meeting this expectation it also confirms my belief that what Trump Twittered many time were part of a negotiating strategy not random thoughts. Thanks for sharing your insights to all of us.",positive
285,Audible Books & Originals,Breaking History: A White House Memoir,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,3,"I’ve never been a fan of Donald Trump or his presidency. Nevertheless, I came to ""Breaking History"" with an open mind. More than a third of the way through this 465-page political memoir that is clearly stated and easy to read, my reaction is decidedly mixed.

On the one hand, readers looking for an objective treatment of the Trump presidency, or Mr. Kushner’s performance as a Presidential advisor, will not find it here. After all, Mr. Kushner is Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, married to his daughter Ivanka. He can be expected to attempt to cast himself, his wife, and President Trump and his administration in the best possible light—which he does. But he does it to such an extent that he often comes off as disingenuous.

In sum, we’re asked to believe that all three were merely unselfish, patriotic, rational all-Americans committed to fighting a cruel and corrupt Washington, D.C. culture that long ago forgot the American people in their rush to embrace globalism. In pushing this theme, Mr. Kushner glosses over a lot and fails, in many instances, to give the full context of the events he describes. In fact, he glosses over so much that, at times, I wondered if I wasn’t reading “The Cliff Notes” on the Trump 2016 campaign and ensuing presidency.

On the other hand, there are some interesting facets to this book. For example, I found his recount of the recent history of the Middle East and the administration’s attempts to forge peace between Israel and various Arab states somewhat informative. In other words, I thought I learned something—at least enough to know that I probably need to learn more and should read further.

I found his treatment of various co-workers inside the Trump White House—especially Steve Bannon and former Chiefs of Staff Reince Priebus and John Kelly—revealing. I wasn’t aware that Mr. Kushner was responsible for hiring Mr. Bannon—somewhat ironic considering Mr. Bannon’s alleged attempts to have Mr. Kushner removed from the White House staff. And then there was the incident involving John Kelly and the downgrade of Mr. Kushner’s security clearance. In any event, it seems that the culture inside the White House was just as cruel, vindictive, and self-serving as the supposed D.C. culture it fought against. Talk about a “team of rivals.”

And I thought it important that Mr. Kushner discussed what he found to be his, and the administration’s accomplishments, especially in the areas of NAFTA, criminal justice reform, Middle East Peace, and COVID.

I haven’t learned all that much about Mr. Trump, yet (although I did find Mr. Kushner’s attempts to equate him with Theodore Roosevelt somewhat “over the top.”) Probably, the most telling thing Mr. Kushner says about the former President is that he cared “more about results than process.” That may be a great way to operate when running a family business. But we’re supposed to be a “nation of laws and not of men.” Our laws set forth and define the processes that govern us. For a president to be less interested in process than the result would seem to set a dangerous, destabilizing precedent.

As I said at the beginning, my reaction is decidedly mixed.",fair

I have completed only the first three chapters, but I want to shower the Goodreads world with this premature review to counter all of the jealous and hateful commentary that already exists in this forum.

I am so very excited to finally learn of Mr. Kushner's background, and I am delighted that true to form, the Trumps (namely Ivanka) selected high quality stock for their dynasty.

I am so glad Jared Kushner took the time to write about his White House experience. This is probably the only book of this kind that I’ll reread.
It brought back memories of the happenings of Trump’s term as President. Kushner’s motto is “Where There is a Will There’s a Way.” Thank you for your service to our Country. Enjoy your time with your family. You truly deserve it!",positive
290,Audible Books & Originals,Breaking History: A White House Memoir,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Jared Kushner author’s this book… the same way he became way more than the President’s son-in-law. There’s a reason he became the President’s top adviser… on everything from how to maximize social media in planning untold strategies… to brokering multiple middle-east peace deals… that every other historical high ranking and leveraged figure never could! This young man is extremely straight forward… as well as intelligent. He knows when to say no and why… and unlike countless failed negotiators and Kings… Princes… Presidents… Vice-Presidents… et al… he knew when to ask questions… AND LISTEN… in situations that few others did.

This story of what it was truly like behind the scenes of Donald Trump’s election and time in office is laid out in such a smooth… intelligent… no-holds-barred format… that the four-hundred-fifty-plus-page book (plus pages of crisp clear color pictures… with interesting historical footnotes) will be read with the type of interest that will make you want to slow down and re-read a few passages as you go… to fully absorb accurately what you just learned… because as sure as I’m typing this review… you’re going to want to quote and discuss these “gems”… WITH FRIENDS AND FOES ALIKE!

The author… in my opinion makes a great decision on what he covers right off the bat. If a potential reader is not aware… his Father was convicted and sent to prison by then New Jersey U.S. Attorney Chris Christie. Jared’s family is extremely close and the years his Father was in prison obviously affected Jared for life… and is one of the reasons that along with the Middle East… prison reform and second chances were high on Kushner’s list right along with peace in the Middle-East. When Trump appointed Christie to head up his transition team… it was quite a dramatic moment in time when in a face to face meeting of all involved Trump said:

“SO, WE ARE GOOD THEN?

JARED REPLIED: “MY FATHER IS GOOD. BETWEEN CHRIS AND ME, IF WE’RE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER, I SHOULD EXPRESS THAT I FELT THE WAY YOU HANDLED MY FATHER’S CASE WAS OVERZEALOUS, AND IT BROUGHT SERIOUS HURT TO ME AND MY FAMILY.”

CHRISTIE EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD JUST BEEN DOING HIS JOB, THAT MY DAD HAD COMMITTED A CRIME, AND THAT IT WASN’T PERSONAL.

“WELL, RESPECTFULLY, I HAVE A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW ON THAT,” I SAID. IF IT WASN’T PERSONAL FOR YOU, THEN HOW COME YOU CHALLENGED MY FATHER’S RELEASE DATE AFTER HE HAD SERVED HIS SENTENCE? I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW BRUTAL IT IS FOR A FAMILY TO HAVE A LOVED ONE IN PRISON. THE ONLY SOLACE IS HAVING A DATE WHEN YOUR NIGHTMARE WILL END. WHEN THE PROSECUTOR COMES BACK AND CHALLENGES THE RELEASE DATE, AND IT GETS DELAYED INDEFINITELY, THAT’S DEVASTATING TO A FAMILY. SO DON’T TELL ME IT WASN’T PERSONAL, BECAUSE IF IT WASN’T PERSONAL, YOU WOULD HAVE LET HIM COME HOME ON TIME.”

“YOU KNOW, THE CRIME YOUR FATHER COMMITTED WAS TERRIBLE.” CHRISTIE STARTED TO SAY.

“THEN TRUMP INTERJECTED: “CHRIS, IT WAS A FAMILY DISPUTE.”

This is just a hint of the absolute “gloves-off-bare-knuckle” storytelling of recent political intrigue and… yes… HISTORY BREAKING! Calling a spade a spade as far as “leakers” and back stabbers such as…. Bannon… Tillerson… Priebus… Lewandowski… Manafort… and the total… spineless abandonment of Israel by the Obama administration… are laid out chapter and verse. Jared also makes the reader truly feel the stress and frustration of lives and political accomplishments put on hold or extremely weighed down by the disgusting phony Russian Collusion Hoax.

The author also shares and educates readers with his Grandparents escaping the Holocaust. The benefit of much of this early introductory narration… is that you can feel and start to understand not just what makes Jared tick… but what the whole of his soul… that he immerses into the opportunities he has to truly make the world a better place. Being that he always tried to stay in the background during the time he served our President and country… and was totally unlike ninety-five-per-cent of politicians who are “me-me-me”… and have ulterior motives… Jared like President Trump… didn’t need this job to earn money.

As someone who is constantly reading my entire life… a key to my enjoyment and my depth of education that I hope to get from each book I read… and how I rate them… is what I have come to call the “AUTHOR’S WRITING STYLE… HIS FLOW… AND… ARTISTIC SIGNATURE”. Unfortunately many authors have no real unique artistry… kind of like an orchestra without any instruments. I really enjoyed many things from Jared… one that I thought was “cute” and kind of endearing was the way… sometimes referring to Donald Trump…as… Trump… or… The President… or… my Father-In-Law… in natural ways based on the storytelling situation.

This is definitely not a “fake-news” kind of book… just trying to shock you… it truly comes across as a book that wants to educate you on the tumultuous period of time that it covers.",positive
291,Audible Books & Originals,Breaking History: A White House Memoir,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,4,"*Note – I do not let political opinions affect my reviews. I review books based on the content, not the political affiliations of the authors. It is my opinion that more people should read books written by current or former government officials, even if you don’t agree with them, because it helps to better understand their perspectives, and get more insight into what is actually happening behind the scenes.

This book has 59 main chapters, with a total of about 465 pages. At the end of the book, after the Acknowledgements, Notes, and Index, there is a Photos section with 32 pictures. There are some pictures of Kushner with his family, and many of him with world leaders from different countries.

Kushner starts the book with a Preface that explains some of his motivations for writing this memoir, and what he hopes readers will get from it. Then in the first chapter, he recalls a pivotal moment in his life when his father was arrested in 2004, after a bitter family feud had resulted in unexpected betrayals. This was a dramatic way to start a book, as Kushner’s father was facing charges of transporting a prostitute across state lines after trying to set up his brother-in-law…

Throughout the early chapters of the book, Kushner covers some of the big influences in his life. He talks about his grandparents surviving the Holocaust, his experiences at Harvard, and his challenges as a real estate investor navigating the crash of 2008. He describes how he met Ivanka, when her father suggested she meet with him to discuss potential real estate deals. The conversations that he recalls seem very realistic, as you can almost hear Trump’s voice saying these things. These early chapters set the tone, as Kushner certainly has a knack for telling an entertaining story.

Kushner continues to recall his experiences as he describes the Trump campaign, conflicts with Chris Christie (who had prosected Kushner’s father), early days of the Trump administration, and his family’s decision to leave their New York lives and move to DC to officially work in the administration. He describes conflicts with Steve Bannon, and early struggles with trying to manage important negotiations and Trump’s tweets at the same time. As the book goes on, Kushner covers his experiences with Trump and world leaders, while also including parts that describe his family life and personal thoughts. There are many different publicized events that you get to see from a slightly different perspective, as Kushner recalls conversations and interactions that were never made public.

Overall, I found this book to be informative, but also at times surprising and fascinating. I really enjoyed reading this more than I thought that I would, and it has certainly given me a slightly different perspective about Kushner, and some of the other people he mentions in the book. Again, I must stress that you do not have to agree with all of his politics to appreciate this window into the behind-the-scenes interactions at the highest levels of government. There are valuable insights here, and I hope that people can overcome the modern political tribalism and try to absorb the information provided by such a rare glimpse into this world.",positive
292,Audible Books & Originals,Breaking History: A White House Memoir,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Jared Kushner has done an exemplary job of detailing his experiences serving the people of the United States and his father-in-law, Donald Trump, former POTUS.

Kushner, like Trump, is a business man; successful in his own right. Drawn into political service by way of marriage to Ivanka, he learns the ropes of D. C. and participates in some of the most successful political accomplishments of the last 50+ years: Abraham Accords, USMCA, Operation Warpspead, Criminal Justice Reform, Border Wall and more.

Contrary to the biased blast proffered by the NYT, Kushner is forthcoming with regards to his shortcomings and his fears. He readily admits to being a novice and openly discusses how he went about learning to navigate the inner sanctums and long serving members of Congress. Kushner uses his skills from business and lessons learned from family and faith to craft an hardworking persevering presence that earned him accolades from foreign countries and brave domestic individuals. Jared doesn’t get all snarky and partisan in this book but he does give specifics on who in the administration was friend or foe; very enlightening.

Unlike other memoirs I’ve read recently, this one has the benefit of more intimate relationships with Trump and the family, for obvious reasons. Kushner doesn’t use his family status as a club to pave the way or wield power for himself. It’s a driving force behind his ardent motivation and the level of insight that we readers are afforded in this engaging, conversational volume.

If you’re interested in greater details about the Middle East peace negotiations or the trade agreement between the USA, Mexico & Canada, this is a good read for you. There’s no politicking and no slandering and even the language is clean. Kushner served with his whole heart and soul, along with his wife, Ivanka. A worthy read; were I younger, I’d be inspired to political service📚",positive
293,Audible Books & Originals,Breaking History: A White House Memoir,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,5,"Like everyone else I was always very curious to know exactly what the family went through in the four years they were in the White House. I think Mr. Kushner wrote an amazing account of his experience not only in the White House but his life experiences which helped him very much navigate what is probably one of the most backstabbing, toxic environment a person could be in. I hope everyone enjoys this book as much as I have and gets a chance to see another side into this presidency…one that has been hindered since the day it began. We as Americans should demand the media and our government to provide us the truth, for so long it has been so dishonest that it has caused the division that we live in. Thank you for such an insightful look into what we on the outside will never understand. It wasn’t easy!!!",positive

The contrast between the Trump administration and the current administration stand in stark contrast.

I would expect this type of book to emphasize the good that has been done and not tear into the president Trump. In meeting this expectation it also confirms my belief that what Trump Twittered many time were part of a negotiating strategy not random thoughts. Thanks for sharing your insights to all of us.",positive
295,Audible Books & Originals,Breaking History: A White House Memoir,$0.00 Free with Audible trial,3,"I’ve never been a fan of Donald Trump or his presidency. Nevertheless, I came to ""Breaking History"" with an open mind. More than a third of the way through this 465-page political memoir that is clearly stated and easy to read, my reaction is decidedly mixed.

On the one hand, readers looking for an objective treatment of the Trump presidency, or Mr. Kushner’s performance as a Presidential advisor, will not find it here. After all, Mr. Kushner is Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, married to his daughter Ivanka. He can be expected to attempt to cast himself, his wife, and President Trump and his administration in the best possible light—which he does. But he does it to such an extent that he often comes off as disingenuous.

In sum, we’re asked to believe that all three were merely unselfish, patriotic, rational all-Americans committed to fighting a cruel and corrupt Washington, D.C. culture that long ago forgot the American people in their rush to embrace globalism. In pushing this theme, Mr. Kushner glosses over a lot and fails, in many instances, to give the full context of the events he describes. In fact, he glosses over so much that, at times, I wondered if I wasn’t reading “The Cliff Notes” on the Trump 2016 campaign and ensuing presidency.

On the other hand, there are some interesting facets to this book. For example, I found his recount of the recent history of the Middle East and the administration’s attempts to forge peace between Israel and various Arab states somewhat informative. In other words, I thought I learned something—at least enough to know that I probably need to learn more and should read further.

I found his treatment of various co-workers inside the Trump White House—especially Steve Bannon and former Chiefs of Staff Reince Priebus and John Kelly—revealing. I wasn’t aware that Mr. Kushner was responsible for hiring Mr. Bannon—somewhat ironic considering Mr. Bannon’s alleged attempts to have Mr. Kushner removed from the White House staff. And then there was the incident involving John Kelly and the downgrade of Mr. Kushner’s security clearance. In any event, it seems that the culture inside the White House was just as cruel, vindictive, and self-serving as the supposed D.C. culture it fought against. Talk about a “team of rivals.”

And I thought it important that Mr. Kushner discussed what he found to be his, and the administration’s accomplishments, especially in the areas of NAFTA, criminal justice reform, Middle East Peace, and COVID.
