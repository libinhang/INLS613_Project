0,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,3,"I appreciate that I got this at a very good Prime Day price. I now have 3 Fire Sticks and am grateful to have them. This generation seems to work faster than the previous as well -- scrolls faster, responds faster. I don't generally use voice, because the previous version was horrid to even attempt, so I gave up long ago.

Now here's the rub. AMAZON, YOUR NEW FIRE STICK DESIGN IS A FAILURE. Here's why:

The new remote is great for those who never used the previous remote. The previous was more streamlined which made it easy to locate buttons without even glancing at it. The previous had fewer buttons so there was little confusion as to what you were pressing at any given time. The batteries were near the bottom of the remote which is where the bulk of the weight would rest perfectly in the palm of your hand.

The NEW remote is the opposite of all of the above. First, there is no way I can find the play/pause button on this remote unless I physically look down at it. Even then, it's smack dab in the middle of a square of NINE buttons, plus 5 more. The mute and live TV buttons are placed so that it's easy to feel for them without having to stop to look at the remote (there is blank space below both). I am often pressing the wrong button when trying to play/pause. Yes, I could click the large round Select button at the top, but if on YouTube, it takes two clicks to pause, and the screen menu appears on the screen which takes yet another click to remove. All this means extra clicks (wear and tear) on the remote, extra battery power, and is a general annoyance.

Now about the battery.. the batteries on the new remote are at the top which puts the bulk of the weight opposite of where most people hold the remote -- either in the palm or with the fingers. I have dropped this thing numerous times already because it feels unbalanced and top-heavy. It is unnatural for the way we're used to most remote controls. In addition, because I still have two other Fire Sticks with remotes that I still use, it is difficult to retrain my hands to use this clumsy, awkward stepchild of a remote just for this one device.

Lastly, the new buttons for streaming services are nice to have, but not the greatest to have. If you truly have -- and USE -- all 4 services, this remote is made for you. Anything less than 2 or 3, and it's just another device with useless functions. While I appreciate being able to single-click to Hulu, I would much rather go through the main menu and get rid of these excess buttons. PLUS, most remotes have a different colored Power button at the top. Between the fact that these buttons being at the bottom + the awkward weight distribution of the remote, I frequently mistakenly hold this remote the wrong way and end up clicking incorrect buttons. I'm watching a video on YouTube, and with one errant click, I'm in that wild maze of a Live TV menu, wonder where I went wrong in life.

AMAZON, HERE'S WHAT TO DO TO IMPROVE THIS REMOTE:
1. Move the batteries back to the bottom right at the area where most people hold the lower half of the remote in their palm. 2. Move the streaming buttons to the top of the remote. 3. Move the mute, volume up, volume down, and Live TV buttons down into a separate section AWAY from the navigational buttons. Leave blank space below the rewind, play/pause, and forward buttons so we can again find these buttons without having to turn on lights and look down at the remote. 4. A more complete transfer of previous Fire Stick data to the new Fire Stick would be appreciated -- my transfer of data was incomplete. Why not allow a simply one-time cloning of apps via Amazon AWS so we don't have to spend an hour reinstalling apps we're used to?

Until then, I'd like my money back or an exchange of this Fire Stick for an older generation like the other two I have. 1 star for the price, 1 star for the volume control, 1 star for speed. I'd take off more stars for the annoyances, however.",fair
1,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"This is my 3rd Fire TV Stick with TV controls. They have all been the newest generation. Without having owned any previous generations I can not attest to the increase in processing power or the speed that apps load compared to the last generation but, it claims to be a 50% increase and I would have to assume that is correct. It is fast from waking it up after it puts itself to sleep or even doing the occasional system reboot. It’s maybe 30seconds for the latter and lightning fast for waking.
If you have an Amazon Prime Account, select that you would like it synced to your account so when you get it, it will have your Prime Video, Amazon Music, And all your smart devices including any Echo devices you have in your household that your current devices have already discovered. So after you plug it in you can almost immediately start watching, listening and using the Alexa Voice bottom located at the top of the remote to initiate either plus control your devices.
For TV power and volume control, please follow the set up. It starts you off with the set up of your TV and you will having it ready to use as your new TV remote for use when enjoying any of your steaming services. Connecting you new Fire TV Stick with TV controls is easier than you would think. Just follow “quick set-up guide in the box. If you are have trouble call customer service to help and guide you through the process.
Pictured are a completely emptied box of all contents that comes with your purchase and you will be amazed at how expertly packaged all those items are in the box. Amazon has minimized waste and uses recycled packaging and there is minimal plastic use. Also, all Amazon devices can be traded in when buying a newer generation where Amazon will give you a discount toward the new old and recycle or renew your old device. It’s a win-win! For the greatest discount, wait until you see the newer device at its lowest price. I’ve noticed it usually about every three months or so they will have a steep discount. So trade in and upgrade with the discount you get for recycling.
I’m using my newest Fire TV Stick w TV controls (pictured in the 1st and 2nd photos) in my bedroom connected to a mini projector that I have pointing up to my ceiling. I purchased an RCA projector from Woot for less than $40 and it included (2) HDMI ports, a micro SD card slot, Bluetooth, VGA and has an incredible bright and large picture that I can watch laying in bed and just looking up. As you can see on this newer generation they have included some shortcuts they I have found perfectly suit my needs. I subscribe to almost every streaming service available out there and these four are by far my favorites. My projector does a max 1080p resolution and this Fire TV Stick delivers that full HD content. The Fire TV Stick with TV control has a very intuitive remote and is easy to use. The only critiques I would give are pretty sever, the remote is hard to find if you misplace it (but a bright colorful silicone case. They sell them on here for under $10), speaking of losing the remote, it’s not a bargain to replace the remote. (In most cases, just buying a brand new Fire TV Stick with TV controls is cheaper), lastly, the remote only has one red dot LED that lights up for a limited number of functions, no buttons light up at all on the remote. It makes for the utmost difficulty if your watching a dark movie and want to use the remote at all. Those three things are clearly a negative but, if you can accept those conditions/flaws than you won’t be disappointed in anything else. If I had to design a remote for this, all buttons would be backlit, there would be a “find function button on the Fire Stick itself (the part plugged into the back of your TV) that would send a Bluetooth signal to illuminate the keys with a quick flashing and an audible sound to locate (interesting fact, your Fire TV Stick with TV controls’s remote is Bluetooth, so no pointing at ur TV, it works in any direction. Even when the TV is not in your line of sight). And lastly, hopefully the remote can always be found but, if not there should be a discounted price for a new remote.",positive
2,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"My Old Apple TV would not support YouTube streaming and so I went shopping for a new one till I saw they were $150. Went to Amazon to price other devices and the Fire Stick was on sale for like 15 bucks so I gave it a try.
This was a great purchase. The Fire Stick integrates with all my other Alexa devices and I can control my TV and streaming channels via Alexa Voice commands as well as view my Ring Doorbell Camera. The Streaming Service Apps for Netflix, Hulu, Prime, YouTube, etc etc etc work great. And there are other online free channels that I didn't even know existed.
It even comes with a remote that accepts voice commands and will control most of the functions on my Insignia TV and Likewise the Insignia TV remote can control the Fire Stick via the HDMI connection.
The only drawback for me is it doesn't support Apple's Airplay for mirroring my iPhone/iPads to the TV although there are some third party apps for the Fire TV to allow Apple Device Mirroring.

The Fire TV Stick IMO is better than my Apple TV (circa 2014) and Roku devices and is less inexpensive.",positive
3,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"***EDIT 05/31/2021 - READ WAY BELOW! AMAZON FIRESTICK 3RD GEN BEATS OUT NVIDIA SHIELD, CHROMECAST 3RD GEN AND ROKU****

I REALLY LOVE THIS NEW DEVICE! IT IS FAST, I CAN STREAM MY OWN MOVIE APPS (CARTOON HD, TYPHOON, SYNCLAIR, FILM PLUS, NOVA, KODI, CINEMA HD) AMAZINGLY FAST!

Netflix and prime is super fast also!!! I AM GOING TO ORDER 4 MORE!! AMAZON FIRESTICK BEATS OUT APPLE TV AND CHROMCAST GOOGLE TV!!!!

Edit 05/03/2021: 4 days of heavy usage (horror movie marathon) and no rebooting, and the firestick has yet to lag or become slow. I switched from wireless to Ethernet and same thing: no issues at all. Absolutely a fantastic device!!!

Edit 05/10/2021: posting a weekly update.

This device is even more amazing than I first noted. I have yet to experience any slowness or lag. I use it approximately 3 to 6 hours a day, sometimes over 6 hours. I use it for the Live tv option, and of course for YouTube, and audible, I am definitely not seeing any lag it is very speedy. With my 4k, at least once a week I had to unplug and plug it back in. NOT THIS 3RD GEN!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET THIS PURCHASE!

A bit of advice on two things:

First, the 4k firetick, while amazing as it is, is running Android 7.1, which can explain the lag between apps.

The 3rd gen runs Android 9.0, which explains the speed increase and better memory management, not to mention more secure (Firesticks are super secure, just my opinion on Android from a full time Android user). Hence, it is a better idea to get the 3rd gen.

Second, I change frequently from WiFi to Ethernet, to continue testing lagging and I have still experienced absolutely no lag. Ethernet connects at 150 Mbps, will not go higher, where as WiFi is 540 Mbps which tells me the Firesticks are made for WiFi, which makes sense however I love the Ethernet option because I have a cable available.

All I can say is, the Firestick outbeats every streaming device out there (except maybe the Nvidia shield) with reliability, speed, ease of use, connectivity. YOU ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT REGRET YOUR PURCHASE!!!!

EDIT 05/19: I started experiencing lagging issues, and had to unplug and restart the Firestick, first time in 30 days! Was hoping to make it to 45 days but 30 days, with 5 to 7 hours a day of use is pretty amazing!!

I made an error earlier on Ethernet speed with Amazon's Ethernet adapter. The Ethernet adapter from Amazon clocks at 150 Mbps, so I bought Cable Matters Micro USB to Ethernet Adapter and .. WOW! I connect at 349 down and almost 40 up!! I have absolutely no internet lag, on or off wifi but I always prefer Ethernet when I can use it.

I managed to download and install a total of 12 applications via filelinked, and I still have 1.99 gb of space available. This firetick continues to amaze me!!!

Firestick once again beats out Roku, Google Chromecast Android tv, apple tv, except the Nvidia shield. You will not regret this purchase!

Edit 05/31/2021:

I decided to purchase a Nvidia shield pro, so that I could compare and because I got a lot of messages stating it is the best on the market.

It was ana amazing setup, the device is powerful, and snappy. I compared it with the 3rd gen stick and the only three differences I noticed was the following:

More memory; shield has 3gb vs 3rd gen having 2gb
Space; shield has 12gb, can be expanded to 1tb. Firestick has 8, expandable to 512gb.
Screen; 4k is absolutely amazing. 3rd gen has 1080.

Compared with he 4k firestick, the screen is the same.

Speed is the same between shield and firesticks, and navigation is as silky smooth HOWEVER, I am noticing via Hulu, Netflix and Disney plus on shield, the voice was not matching up to the characters when watching movies and shows. No matter what I did: uninstall, reinstall all three apps, shut down and restarted numerous times. It is really annoying and does defeat the entirety of the device as a streaming device.

Price; Nvidia shield is $199, 2019 model with Android 9, April security...Chromecast Android tv is Android 10 with may security patch..at $49.99, 2020 model.... 3rd gen is $39.99 and prime day you can probably get it for $24.99..for a 2021 model. I will not rate Roku because you cannot sideload apps, and it is limited like apple streaming.

Winner?

AMAZON!!! AMAZON IS THE ABSOLUTE WINNER!

For price, security patches, navigation, side installing apps, ease of use... COME ON FOLKS! I DEBUNKED THE NVIDIA SHIELD MYTH!! I also am returning the shield because I cannot keep something that cannot handle streaming.

Note: Nvidia shield is amazing for gaming, and absolutely beats out all streaming devices. This is just streaming applications that I have reviewed and an issue with!",positive
4,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"I use fire TV on both my televisions. I had an old model (no TV controls) that I just replaced with this one, which was offered at a very good price (under $20) during a Prime Days promotion. These install easily and the remote function is much better in every way than the older one this replaced. This particular model won't do 4k streaming but that isn't important to me. It's very simple to change a few settings on a Fire Stick, which will then allow you to download and use many apps available from 3rd party sources. Some of these apps are useful and many are trash, but that has nothing to do with the Fire TV Stick. The only real complaint I have is that these don't have as much memory as I would like, since I do personally use a lot of the 3rd part apps. Overall, if you are not big into watching live cable TV, this is a great way to save money. You can get apps that you have to subscribe to that will get you live sports and other cable-like services if you want, or you can just use free stuff... which is great if you're not a big TV watcher. Prime members get a selection of free movies and shows -- not a huge selection but it's included with Prime. Personally I don't see ever going back to a cable or satellite TV service that charges a fortune for lots of shopping channels and replays of the same movies over and over. I do miss live sports, but that's why there are sports bars.",positive
5,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"I have no complaint with the ease of ordering or the price or delivery.

But FireStick has frustrated me from the beginning. Alexa rarely understands my requests and I have a Midwestern accent so not very unique. When I request PBS, she can't understand it even after several different requests and often switches the show I want back to a pay-to-view channel instead of PBS. I ended up with some charges per show because I didn't realize she had switched me and hit ""play"" and didn't see the small print (really small print) that there was a charge until it was too late. So, I'm keeping it at this point but I will go back to my AppleTV when I can't stand it anymore. PBS is the only thing I watch on it and now I know to be very careful before clicking Play.!",positive
6,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"I got this during Prime Days for only $16! I was having a terrible time watching Amazon Prime with my old Firestick. It kept telling me I had no internet connection, the sound kept lagging, the remote wasn't in sync, Hulu lost connection all the time, and everything took forever to load. When I saw that I could get a new stick that was even better with the TV controls and the automatic access to Hulu, Netflix... I thought it was worth a try. So, yep everything is working great now, must of been my old other stick that was the issue. Hoping this new stick lasts. I love how quickly everything loads now I hit a button and boom I'm on Hulu. I also love that I can turn my tv on and off and adjust the volume on my Firestick now too. The only downside is I still have to get up and get to the right spot like I do when using the tv remote. I was hoping they would work sitting too like everything else on the Firestick. Overall I am so happy to have seamless streaming back and totally recommend this!",positive
7,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"Now that it’s properly set up, I love this Fire TV Stick HD with Alexa! I’m using it with a 2007 Vizio TV in the kitchen, and it’s giving me live and on-demand access to my favorite apps and TV. Did I mention that this TV doesn’t have Wi-Fi and that I planned to buy a new one to connect to my mesh setup? It was Prime week and I mentioned my plan to an IT tech at work and he suggested this HD fire stick. I bought it for more than 50% off! It was delivered the next day and I started the easy set-up process, but got stuck when asked to sign into my Amazon account to receive a code to input on the set-up screen. At this point it was all uphill with my limited tech skills. I didn’t think the Fire stick would work if I didn’t already have Alexa. Wrong!

The tech at work told me to bring it in, he used my Amazon account to set it up (the Fire stick has built in memory!), I took it home and plugged it in and voila! Now I can use Alexa and see my favorite TV series, along with Netflix and SiriusXM. I’m lovin it! Now that the Fire stick has saved me the cost of an updated TV, I’ll consider buying a new monitor!
Don’t give up on the set up!",positive
8,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"My first firestick was the cheapest and lasted 7 years. It got great reception, for at the time I was so broke and borrowing a hospital across the streets Wi-Fi, better than any since in fact. So during this time I got my second to use in my bedroom, I live in a HUD apt less than 400sq ft, but though it was the newest, bestest Amazon had I could not pick up a signal anywhere.

Last year my original died so I ordered a new one, again the cheapest, but I now have Wi-Fi...slow but Wi-Fi. It worked quite well so during a sale I bought one that had tv remote with it. Loved it! So much so that when it went on sale again, I got a second for my bedroom. So, suffice to say I am pleased with the Firestick. I do like the luxury of only one remote to control tv and firestick. Sounds corny I know but after working my butt off my entire life my husband died from cancer, lost everything and living in filthy HUD apt so to me it is a luxury...one that I appreciate.",positive
9,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"Seems like every couple of years, we end up buying a new firestick. The older versions seem to have problems connecting after awhile. With that said, this newer version is pretty nice! I like the channel buttons on the bottom of the firestick. It makes things easier for those who aren't tech savvy like the grandkids. The only reason I dropped a star was because this firestick wouldn't connect to our 3rd gen Alexa (she's my favorite). So I will have to put the 3rd gen in my office and put the 4th gen in the living room, which really isn't a big deal. Otherwise, we really like this new one. Everything was easy to set up, just had to remember a few passwords and we were ready to go.",positive
10,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,4,"Being an all Apple household I have to say this device impressed me quite a bit. I purchased a Firestick Lite over a year ago to take with me for travel but it had a bit of lag and seemed to have network drop outs on hotel WiFi (I know hotel WiFi is less than desired but it was annoying). In December this device was on sale for over half off and I decided to try it out. This was after I had gotten the previous Firestick 4K which was a decent product but I found out it for whatever reason cannot get the latest software (but the ""less capable"" Firestick Lite can, baffling I know). I purchased this one and sent back the FireStick 4K as the refund on the Firestick 4K covered the cost of this one and then some.

Things that impressed me (with caveats):

1. Ability to use captive portal internet. Currently the tvOS on the AppleTV does not allow for this unless you go through a process to spoof the MAC address of a device on the captive portal or somehow get a hold of the internet provider's help desk to have them add the MAC address. A ""dance"" I successfully completed once but by the time I was complete it was too late to watch anything. Caveat, this will be resolved with the upcoming release of tvOS 15.4 as the beta version has the ability to connect to captive portal internet in hotels.

2. Ease of use - plug it into the HDMI port and power via the Micro USB port via the TV or power brick. Then sign into your Amazon account.

3. Picture is really good on both 4K TVs and 1080 TVs

4. Responsive when going through menus and applications - caveat, if there is enough storage available to make memory and swap cache available. (See below).

5. Main screen is customizable and you are able to set your favorite applications there. Especially helpful for use by kids.

6. Ability to set multiple profiles. I have two daughters and was able to add the kids profiles that they use on their Amazon Fire Kids tablets. We will not go into the annoyances with the Kids interface. Caveat related to limited storage and having to ""download"" applications to the Kid's profile is counts towards the storage limit.

Annoyances:
1. Amount of storage is only 8GB? It's 2022 Amazon could afford to add more storage to these devices without adding much to the cost. Even 16GB of flash storage would be better. Having to offload applications in order to make cache available to applications can properly run gets old. Yes, I understand you can attach an external device to this for giving it more storage via a hub for applications but that negates the ""throw it in your backpack and go"" idea I bought it for.

2. Not being able to easily close down applications to make more RAM and storage available (see above). I know this device is more or less running Amazon's version of Android, but even a quick way to shut down applications from the remote would be convenient.

3. The constantly running ads in the main interface and now the ads that pop-up when using live streaming applications like DirectTV Stream. We've come accept commercials are annoying enough when watching broadcast TV but an ad that takes over the screen in the middle of the program is a bit too far.

4. No geo-location ability. This means applications that have the ability to ""know"" where it is based on the IP address of the internet will automatically know which channels to load (or allow you to ""spoof"" your location with a VPN). If this is not present services like DirectTV Stream default to the billing zip code and you are locked to the channels for your billing zip code.

5. Kid's Profile cannot be sorted and customized in the same way the regular profile can. Unlike the AppleTV, it is not a profile set with age restrictions and purchase restrictions and it being there same interface as the adult profiles. It might be cute to have a kids interface but it's annoying for kids who already know how to navigate the regular interface. It is the same type of profile that the tablet has and more or less shows what ""Amazon thinks they would like"" based on habits. Applications cannot be pinned and in addition to this they have to be re-downloaded after being added to their profile instead of just appearing on the profile. This counts towards the used storage. Amazon needs to fix this across all of their devices and do what iOS and tvOS does and have a data partition for a user with applications be available to all users so you do not have to re-download applications. The above said, I've deleted the kids profiles. My kids only go to the pinned applications and access their profiles continued in those applications.

6. All of the privacy settings are automatically set to ""allow"" - location, watching history, targeted ads, application downloads etc. You have to go into every application as well as the settings for the device and the application setting on the device to turn all of this off. Unless you really ""dig"" the settings are kinda hidden which is the point as Amazon makes a ton of money off of selling the data provided by the device and applications to 3rd parties.

7. Updates are a PITA. Update notifications are given but not for how many or what they are for. Usually it takes several attempts to check for and run all of the updates. Several times I have thought I bricked the device as it seems to hang when ""installing"". Backing out of the update, restarting the device and running the scan for updates then shows the update completed and another update is showing. This is a common theme with all Android based devices.

Conclusion:
If you are an Apple user and looking for something that give you access to your streaming services (Disney+, Netflix, Hulu, DirectTV Stream, PBS etc) on the as well as AppleTV+ this device will do the job. If you are like me this will more than likely be your travel and secondary device that gets tossed in or stays in a bag. DO your due dillgence and turn on all of the privacy settings to ""off"" or ""do not allow"" for the FireOS and each application, this usually stops the ads during live TV streams.",positive
11,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,5,"In the past, it was hard to get all your favorite streaming apps in one place or even impossible. You either had to buy a new smart DVD player with the streaming apps or an expensive smart TV that also has the streaming apps. Now you can buy a small TV stick that gets plugged into your Tv, and it has everything on it. So, I bought it, and I have to say that I’m thoroughly impressed with the Fire TV Stick 4K Max. This device stick and remote truly shows how far we have come with technology. I was hesitant to buy it at first because I wasn’t sure if it was worth the money, or if it would even work since there are some bad reviews about it. However, I will have to disagree with those bad reviews. I love this Fire TV Stick 4K Max because it lets me watch whatever I want from my favorite subscription apps, it’s now easier to find a movie or TV show with Alexa, the home screen display is easy to navigate, and the processor is so much faster.
When I first review a product, the most important thing I look for is accuracy. Did the product come with everything included in the box? Is it accurate to the product's description? The answer to these questions is yes. In the box, you get: Fire TV Stick 4K Max, an Alexa voice remote, HDMI extender cable for the Fire TV Stick 4K Max, USB cable with the power adapter, 2 AAA batteries, and a quick start guide. The Fire TV Stick came in a well-packaged box, and it looks exactly like the pictures on the Fire TV Stick 4K Max product detail page on Amazon.
The Fire TV Stick 4K Max has all the streaming apps that were said in the product’s description, plus many more additional apps. I know some of the other reviews said that a few of the streaming apps were not working, but that was not the case for me. All the major streaming apps are on here like: Netflix, Disney +, HBO Max, Hulu, Prime Video, YouTube, plus many more. I personally like the fact that you have to manually download each streaming app because it lets you have the streaming apps you want, and not use the GBs on streaming apps you don’t use. I’ve also noticed that the processing time for each app to open is so much faster than what I used to have. In the past, it would take up to a minute for my smart DVD player to open the streaming services, and now it only takes seconds to open.
Along with all the streaming apps that I wanted; the Fire Tv Stick came with other accessories. There are a bunch of other streaming apps that are available to download in the Appstore, and I didn’t even recognize some of them. You can also download some games from their Appstore too. However, I haven’t downloaded any of them, so I can’t really say if they are any good. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max also allows you to watch live news without having to switch to the cable Tv, and these are only the main accessories.
Another thing I like about the Fire Tv Stick 4K Max is the layout of the home page and the remote. On the home page, there is a small bar that lets you put 6 streaming apps you want on there, so they will be faster to find. When you’re browsing on the home page, a lot of the time a trailer or video clip will pop up on the top right corner that’s about the movie or TV show. This is nice for knowing what a movie or show is all about. The remote has 4 preset buttons for Prime Video, Netflix, Disney +, and Hulu, which makes it easier to open those apps. It was also nice to see that the volume buttons work. Since, in the past, I always had to use the cable TV remote to adjust the volume; it was a hassle to have 2 different remotes to control the TV.
If you’re still not convinced, then I think the cherry on top is the Alexa button that might convince you. The Alexa voice button is very convenient, and it makes streaming the different apps so effortless. It’s now easier than ever to search for your favorite movie or TV show with just your voice; you don’t have to look through each streaming app to see who has it on-demand or look it up on your phone. With the Alexa voice button, you just have to say what you want to watch, and Alexa will find it for you to watch it. The Alexa feature on the TV also works like any other Alexa device, so it also allows you to look up news events, weather forecasts, and listen to music. This is nice for people who don’t have any other Alexa device since it’s like a built-in Alexa device for your TV.
Now that you have read my review, I hope I’ve made your decision on buying the Fire TV Stick 4K Max easier. Whether you are still contemplating on buying it or not, I still think this is a great product. It is a great way to watch your movies and shows with your favorite streaming apps from one place. This little TV stick is so smart, and the Alexa voice button is a very nice feature to have. So, in conclusion, I definitely recommend buying this Fire TV Stick 4K Max.",positive
12,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,5,"Here's my disclaimer: I didn't install it myself. My daughter did that, and she did so in a a matter of minutes -- versus the deathless aeons it would have taken me.

And now I am not only enjoying excellent television, but I'm free of the expensive yoke of the major cable companies (like Comcast, Dish and DirecTV). I am saving over $100 a month -- that's over $1200 a year -- and I am not feeling like aI lost all that much in the bargain.

If you're old-fashioned, or simply old, like I am, you might be dragging your feet because you can't see yourself making the leap to less expensive television. You feel that you'll be lost when it comes to the new technology, and damn it, things are just changing TOO much, and you'll never keep up, so why not just stay the way you are. At the same time, however, you're complaining ""How can it be that I have literally hundreds of channels, but there's nothing on I want to watch?""

Depending on the screening services you load, you'll very likely save a good deal of money over the year.

I'm assuming most people reading this have Amazon Prime, and that you've had it for some time, so you're already eligible for all of the extensive streaming there. Netflix is also terrific (I canceled my mailed discs), and also great are HBO Max, Hulu, Disney, Discovery, and Paramount (I LOVE me some YELLOWSTONE) and many others. All cost money to join, but the prices are often around or under $10 a month. You can join several services for under $30 - $40 a month... and that's a lot cheaper than the over $100 many of us already paying to see those hundreds of shows you don't watch.

And for those who are worried (I'm talking to you, fellow Elder Folk) that this new type of navigating will be something unimaginably difficult, think again. In essence, here it is: you click on pictures. It's that simple.

And though certain services come with commercials, the amount is minimal, and often under a minute. It's nothing at all like the cable services,

The picture quality is amazing, and I can't detect any lag or delay in my viewing; and there is excellent sound through the Dolby Atmos; and there is also the ability to use enhanced voice searching through Alexa (which can also be done remotely).",positive
13,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,1,"After hours of trying to set up this product and thinking its finally working multiple times I keep encountering more product bugs. I purchased the top of the line 4K Max stick and found the following:

1) Spent an hour setting up the stick, added our family’s amazon account and it downloaded the Kids’ profiles. Cool experience, Amazon Kids UI for the kids —- if it worked. Everytime I tried to swap to one of the Kids’ profiles an error message appeared saying an error occurred changing profiles and to try again later. Changing to adult profiles worked fine.

Called Amazon Fire support, they didn’t have that error in their documentation, but they had me factory reset the stick which erased all the apps and settings I just finished setting up.

After the reset the Kids’ profiles would open, so I spent several hours downloading various apps and authenticating each one with my cable provider - one by one so I could watch ABC, NBC, etc. Some apps were better than others and detected they were on a cable provider’s connection, where others required me to manually login, most required going to a webpage and entering a code to unlock streaming.

2) The Amazon video app isn’t compatible with Amazon Kids mode. If you press the Amazon video app button on the remote while in Kids mode an error appears saying the app isn’t supported. This makes sense, kind of, since Kids mode is its own video app, but the experience here is broken.

3) After I thought everything finally worked I tried to actually watch a video as my Kid’s account. Black screen, nothing! Left the kid profile and went to an adult and then back and the video started playing suddenly. Tried that same step again for another video and it wouldn’t play. Rebooted stick and video played without issue.

Update: Day#2: Kids woke up and tried to watch videos. They were able to intuitively navigate the remote control, however, they woke us up saying the videos didn’t work. The Amazon Kids video black screen returned again. I was able to go back and get to an adult profile with our parental code and everything worked fine - this is a bug in the Kids app. Reboot fixed it again, but who wants to need to teach their kids to reboot their fire stick every few days?

Day#3 Kids were watching videos and turned off TV. They tried to turn on TV and the screen was black. I needed to know to try to navigate to home from the black screen. This felt like a poor implementation of HDCP copy protection where it stopped playback when the TV was turned off but didn’t display a message or return gracefully to the video app.

4) The video in general was horrible on my TV - just about everything had a flicker, including menus, etc. I disabled HDR and it fixed the issues.

5) When exiting and returning to kids mode (including a different child’s profile) the screen will display the prior child’s screen content, go black and then end up where expected on the correct child’s profile home screen

6) Performance is really bad at times when not doing anything taxing. This is especially true when trying to add applications. I tried to download several at a time in queue and one of them errored out during the install (not the download). Lots of navigation lags and freezes. This reminds me of an old cable box when they first supported on demand and apps - changing from one app to another was slow and often long load screens. Same here, except its inconsistent. It acts like the storage in the stick is low end and can’t keep up at times.

7) There appears to be no system-wide way to disable the voice remote feature. A couple apps supported this feature, but those were seldom.

8) The remote control feels cheap. The left/right/up/down/select buttons feel flimsy especially given how often they get used. The remote in general was smaller and lighter than expected.

9) The whole apps experience is annoyingly complex. They have featured apps which they make easy to find, but then you can get the app store app to go search for other apps. The home screen feels like Amazon Video with rows of video content recommendations and upsells, but no way to customize the tiles. To get to apps you’ve installed you need to scroll over to the add app icon in the menu bar which will show installed apps. There is no option to make that the default landing screen when the home button is pressed, nor promote all apps to the home screen (or turn off all of the other video and app upsells/recommendations on the home screen

10) my Fire stick has updated multiple times tonight fully. Support insists that a factory reset wouldn’t revert system updates, but yet it needed updates after the factory reset. Undesirable but understandable. But whats more odd is the stick has been “fully up to date” and then later needing updates 2-3 times since then.

11) on the home screen (filled with recommendations of apps and videos) there is no filter options to only display things we own. Many video apps (such as Amazon video) have intermixed free and ads in their menus - this is more of that style of approach, except its on a hardware device which was needed to be purchased vs a software video app. Meanwhile the apps which will show content we subscribe to (ABC, NBC, etc) get pushed to another place which is obscurely navigated to via an icon in the menu bar which looks like its for adding new apps.

12) Also, I’ve found that in the Kids video app there is not an easy way to ply a video from the beginning. There is a single play arrow which resumes the video from the last location. To play from the beginning we need to start playback and rewind or go into a more options menu and select play from beginning. This is in the Kids video app, which makes it far too complex for small kids. Why Amazon omitted their play from beginning icon which is present on their other platforms is unclear and an usability miss.

13) There are parent profiles and Kids profiles, but the parent profiles don’t timeout if they sit idle for too long. Ideally if we forget to logout in the evening the Fire stick would have an option after x hours to return to the profile screen so the kids have access to kid safe content

14) while idle, the Fire screen saver with no one logged in seems to be scenic landscapes, but when logged in to a parent profile I saw video upsells which are not always young kid appropriate (action adventure video upsells). Ex: code black ad with a photo of a guy screaming with a scary face, yellow jacket image of girl with bugged out eyes, bloody nose, bee on face, I know what you did last summer image of partly topless (but not explicit) people. The entire screen saver is a rotating advertisement when logged in vs the scenic landscapes displayed when logged out.

The top banner image bar on the adult profile having a picture of a lady with a bloody nose big eyes and bumble bees on her face (ad for yellow jackets) wasn’t toddler appropriate.

Although this was all while in a parent profile, I didn’t expect simply sitting at a home screen menu would be inappropriate for young kids.

15) This is missing feature vs a bug, but there is not an “Input select” button on the Fire remote. So while it can volume up, power on/off a TV there is no way to change to another device without walking over to the TV or keeping another remote around. This isn’t an issue if Fire stick is the only thing plugged in to the TV, but if there is a game console plugged in, a cable box, etc being able to change inputs is more annoying because of that one button not existing on the remote. Plugging the fire stick to an Xbox HDMI input/passthrough might be a work around but that adds complexity and devalues the stick’s appeal of having all the apps on it ( most of which also exist on the Xbox)",negative
14,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,4,"I bought this Fire TV Stick 4K MAX just to listen to Amazon Music HD/UHD that I'm in a free trial. My Denon AVR-2312ci is a 192Khz/24 bit compatible PCM receiver. I have played numerous 192Khz/24 bit songs in PCM through this receiver without any problems. The Fire Stick 4K MAX will only play at 48khz/16 bit. It also gives false info to the Denon where it thinks it's a 192Khz song. Fact is that it displays on the Denon information screen as 192Khz when app output states 44.1Khz, 48Khz, 96Khz, or 192Khz.

Looks like I found the problem. The UHD audio setting under the Amazon Music Unlimited app glitches. When it glitches, the UHD audio states enabled but as it is stating this, the app displayed output is only 16 bit audio at 48Khz. Then when the main app audio setting is disabled, then the app display states the output is 24 bit 192Khz or 96Khz (depending on the source). After restarting the Fire TV Stick 4K max, it did go back as it should. Weird how it glitches on the apps audio setting so once it's enabled, do not toggle it back and forth as it will glitch again. I confirmed all this in my Denon's information display. What I did find, no matter the source HD/UHD sampling frequency or the app displayed output sampling frequency quality, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max up samples the actual HDMI output to 192Khz, as stated in my Denon receiver information display.

What I also did, is compare the normal lossy standard quality signal output from Amazon Music Unlimited on my Roku devices. I have Roku devices and Fire TV sticks in both of my HT systems. I compared at 16 bit/44.1Khz on my regular Fire TV stick and the Fire TV Stick 4K Max. 16 bit/44.1Khz is what a CD plays at and is considered CD quality. With both systems, the CD quality music absolutely blew away the Standard lossy quality on my Roku devices which is actually higher quality than Spotify or Pandora!! The difference was HUGE. The CD quality played about 4 - 5 db quieter obviously for higher dynamic peaks, and the frequency response was a lot fuller with a lot more detail and bass. The imaging was much more focused with greater detail than the standard lossy audio. The standard lossy audio was was more diffused and not as focused, and had a harsher sound with less bass.

The quality difference from standard lossy audio to CD quality 16 bit/44.1Khz was huge and actually a huge reason not to ever listen to lossy audio again. I heard the same with MP3 songs even at a high bit rate, before but thought things were better now. Didn't realize just how much fidelity I was losing by listening to Standard lossy audio. Maybe now that I have found lossless audio on Amazon Music Unlimited HD, I may try using the Fire TV Sticks for all my movie apps instead of just Amazon Music Unlimited HD. I'll see how the Stick goes with music. Obviously, UHD audio at 24 bit depth sounds much better than HD (CD audio quality) at 16 bit depth, wit greater detail.

The main thing I hate about these Fire Sticks is that the Amazon Music Unlimited app continues to play music even after you hit the home button to get out of the app. So it's still sucking all my data on my WIFI while I'm not using it!! There needs to be a work around so that it stops playing music when the home button is pushed like on Roku!!

I'm giving it a new rating from 1 to 4, since the app had the glitch instead of the fire stick. The glitch needs to be fixed so it can operate correctly on the 4K Max Stick. After all, they are both from the SAME COMPANY!",positive
15,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,4,"I have a Wifi 6 supported router (BGW 320-505 Nokia) from AT&T with up to a gig of speed using fiber. The Firestick 4K Max is very fast at loading apps and the picture quality is very good. Audio is also very good but occasionally there is a sync issue with someone speaking. This might not have anything to do with the Firestick though. I was using Chromecast with Google TV as I have YouTube TV and as you would expect they worked seamlessly together. The picture and sound quality is pretty much the same with the Firestick being quicker to go from app to app or load. The Firestick also has picture in picture which is great with my security cameras. There is a lot to like here including the live TV area. I do wish the live channels could be arranged by preference, maybe there is a way and I just haven't figured it out. Here is what I am not crazy about, the menu or landing page. The Home, Find, Live in my opinion should be at the top of the page horizontal or vertical. This would allow for more apps to show as opposed to 6 and should simply scroll with no need to drop to an apps area (3 little squares). I would also prefer the viewing recommendations pull from the apps I use up front versus being lost down the menu. Prime content takes precedence pretty much over everything. Once in your app that doesn't really matter but what does matter is the ads, which can be annoying. All in all there are things I like and things I dislike.",positive
16,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,5,"As the headline indicates, I used the Fire Stick 4k to obtain a better User Interface (UI). The older Vizio UI was slow, and barely configurable. Plus, the wifi would regularly buffer, interrupting the stream. The Fire Stick's processing power and wifi interoperability are far superior to the native Vizio operating system. Boot up with the Fire Stick is almost instantaneous. Apps are easy to install, streaming is smooth and buffering is rare. The UI is nicely configurable, allowing easy access to installed apps.

When you change from one app to another (for instance, going from the YouTube app to the Disney app), the context switch is very quick, with the target app's boot time taking most of the switch time. Way better than the stock UI of the Vizio.

Plus, there is a lot of growth potential with the Fire Stick. Get a bluetooth keyboard and surf the net. Get a bluetooth game pad and play Amazon Luna games. Still learning about it, but happy thus far.",positive
17,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,5,"If over 68,000 reviews weren't enough, here's one more. Set-up was easy and straight-forward with no issues. Less than 5 minutes, including unboxing, installation and then configuration.

This model replaces a prior generation 4k FireTV stick that I've been using the last two years. After signing up for HBOMax a few days ago, I noticed some issues with the TV show 'Barry' blacking out video after a few minutes, even though I could hear the sound. Rewinding the show a bit, and then re-starting the stream would resolve the issue. Having an IT background, it seemed that this may be indicative of a memory/buffering issue with the old 4k FireTV stick I've been using. So, in this one goes today. It does seem to resolve the issue.

Another benefit is that even though I only have a 1080HD TV, the image quality/clarity is noticeably better for me on YouTubeTV, Hulu and HBOMax - the apps I tested today. The improvement on YouTubeTV definitely seems to be related to the memory upgrade, as the stream is coming through at full HD, instead of ratcheting down a level. Noticed that I did need to change some brightness and contrast settings on my TV, as they tended to be just a bit darker with this stick. 2 minutes on my TV display settings, now its all good.

Update: Have upgraded my home wifi to wifi 6, and the stream via this 4k Max stick is impeccable. No stutter, flicker, etc. Super clean and crisp on all fronts.",positive
18,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,5,"If you have a smart tv with apps, keep in mind that you cannot truly rely on them , you need an Apple TV , or top of the line amazon fire stick . Apple TV 4K is $199, Amazon’s best 4k stick is $55.

Couple things that happened when I spent the $55 on the amazon 4k Max stick :

1. All the episodes of Jack Ryan were available on prime , on my smart tv’s prime app this didn’t happen, only season 2!?!

2. Sound and video were improved even though I had supported apps on my smart tv, and I cannot begin to tell you how much improvement I saw on Dolby Atmos support, especially Disney Plus and HBO Max , which had the apps on my smart tv but their Dolby Atmos sound was much better on the fire stick max 4k! Also Dolby Atmos support on the apps on the smart tv wasn’t perfect as Disney Plus didn’t have that support until I upgraded to the Fire Stick 4k Max! Then I had the best possible support for audio and video!

3. Dolby Vision is supported and HDR is supported and in a much improved manner so the $55 upgrade was completely unexpected and absolutely needed!

It’s the upgrade you thought you really didn’t need until you saw considerable improvements and apps that are more frequently updated on the platform!",positive
19,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,5,"If you watched any science fiction shows like Disney's OBI-WAN series, the majority of the film takes place at night. With my previous firestik, all I saw was shadows. I have a state-of-the-art 8K Sony OLED TV, and complained about still not being able to see anything in a dark scene. But my daughter told me that she read that the problem might be with the firestick itself. She read a review that said the 4K Max was much better at low light conditions. So, I waited for Prime Day (my new holy day of obligation) and got this baby... I immediately went to OBI-Wan and....Darned if it wasn't 100% better. I could actually see the scene where Darth Vader in black fights Obi-wan. It really isn't just glowing light sabers!

So, if you have read this far and were worried about why you want this stick vs. the other choices out there, rest assured that you will not regret this purchase, which improves upon the firestick in every way. It is faster, more responsive, has a better remote, and is overall better at sound, closed captioning, and video quality. Nicely done, Mr. Bezos!",positive
20,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, motion detection, Works with Alexa",$34.99 - $49.99,4,"UPDATED: When I saw these smaller cameras announced I was excited and looked forward to adding them to my existing 5 camera Blink system. I figured these would be a great replacement for the XT/XT2 cameras that I had inside my house so I could then re-purpose those for additional outdoor locations. I thought this was a brilliant addition to the Blink camera ecosystem, adding a lower cost camera for indoor applications like mine where the benefits of the battery power and weather-proofness would be overkill. Soon as they were released I ordered up a two-pack to add to my system. I installed one of the them and found that the picture quality right out of the box wasn’t the best but once you change the video quality setting to “Enhanced” it’s right up there with the XT2 quality. The motion detection is a little spotty, as they use a new digital method of detecting motion (AI compares one frame to the next to check for changes). Some very subtle movement will show up, like a shadow moving across the viewing area, but then actually walking across it won’t (sometimes). A rep I spoke with said that they are working on an update to improve the consistency of that feature, which will be available as an over-the-air update since it is a digital-based feature, which I think is pretty cool. So originally my poor review was based around the cloud storage feature on these cameras. After I purchased these cameras I looked into the cloud storage feature as all of the literature I found on them stated that a subscription would be required. Since this is different than the previous XT & XT2 systems I was not pleased about this. After I posted my original review a rep from Blink reached out to clarify the cloud storage situation. So here is what I learned: If you already have an XT or XT2 system, then you can add these cameras to it without having to get a paid subscription. If you do not have a Blink system at all, and these cameras are the first ones you get, then you get a free subscription until December 31st, 2020; then you will pay $3/month per camera after that. By then though, they plan to have released a new sync module with an SD card slot so that you can locally store video clips without having to pay for a subscription at all. Personally I don’t think they intend to have too many people on the subscription plan, I think they see the SD card functionality being more of a selling point but they had to piggy-back the first adopters of these Mini cameras onto the cloud storage until the new sync module gets released. Maybe they had delays in getting the new sync module released at the same time as the Mini due to factory closings around the world right now. I am much happier after this getting cleared up, but hope that they update the cloud storage & subscription info on the product pages to make it much clearer how this all works. Had I looked at all of the available info before buying these, then I probably would not have purchased them based on the unclear info that’s out there. In the end, the savior of the situation was the rep that contacted me from Blink. He clarified all of my concerns, gave me a great amount of info on the product, and answered all of my questions (I had lot of them). To be clear, the rep did not once ask me to change my review, take it down, or in any way artificially influence me to do any of those things. The great job he did led to me to change this of my own accord, as they really took care of my concerns. One star deducted for the confusion but three added back in for the great CS experience. Good product can get you a buyer, but good service gets you a customer for life. Blink has done a fantastic job turning a disappointed (and misinformed) buyer into a satisfied customer. So to recap, if you have an existing Blink system, buy these and use ‘em where you don’t need the wireless ones. If you are looking to get these as your first Blink setup, get them knowing you will have the option of paying for a subscription starting in 2021 or a one-time purchase of a sync module with SD card slot to store your video clips.",positive

I got it in this afternoon, and set up was super easy. The picture quality is excellent for the price point.

The main issue for me is that there is no option for continuous viewing. The live view from the app will automatically shut off after 30 seconds if you don't tap the ""continue?"" prompt. If I had known this ahead of time, I would have never purchased a Blink camera. I watch my daughter on a Fire tablet while I work at night, and it's really not feasible to stop typing every 30 seconds to press a button.

Maybe it's my fault for not realizing it, but I don't remember reading any information about the length of viewing time, so I assumed it would be like the Foscam I had sought to replace. If Blink ever adds an update for continuous viewing, I would repurchase in a heartbeat, but for now, I'm sending it back.",negative
22,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, motion detection, Works with Alexa",$34.99 - $49.99,3,"I pre-ordered 4 cameras without any reviews having been posted, so I hope that this helps someone. First off, the cameras are pretty nice, very easy to setup and get connected and the price is just about perfect. The app is where things start to fall apart. It clearly was created for the other Blink cameras that are battery dependent, so most of the quirks/problems I found are probably necessary for battery savings on the other Blink cameras. I have had cameras for well over ten years and have gone through several different apps/programs to access and store the video but I have never had an app that did NOT allow me to view all of my cameras at the same time. This one requires you to select a single camera and activate it individually to view real time video. I assume that this was designed for battery savings, but since these cameras are always on, it now serves no purpose. Additionally, not having the ability to view all of my cameras, while activated in a single 4 pane window seems a step in the wrong direction. For years I have been able to see live feeds in a multi-pane format and select the camera I want to zoom in on that one, not with this app.

Second, tech support is, at best, not good. I contacted them regarding the IR light that apparently can NOT be turned off (although you can turn it off via the app for the other Blink cameras?!) and the support tech actually stated that he did not know anything about these cameras and had to ask someone else. That was a first for me. The IR light is probably not a big deal for most, but I have for years had an indoor camera pointed out a window since my front yard is pretty well lit at night and the IR light stuck in the ON position make that impossible.

I never review anything, but I wanted to get the word out on this. I suspect that these cameras were kind of rushed and the app just re-purposed, so it my sincere hope that they will address the live view concerns in future app updates specific to Blink Mini owners. Soon I hope!!!! Here's to hoping!

Update: I was contacted by Blink following regarding my review. They indicated that multiple people had voiced similar concerns about the apps real-time capabilities and they made it sound like they were developing an update to the app to address this. They also offered to send me an additional camera (an older model) that does allow you to turn off the IR at no charge. I asked directly if this would be in exchange for changing my review and they specifically did NOT ask me to amend this review. If nothing else, that is GREAT customer service.",fair

The following Summer we were so happy with our indoor system, we decided to purchase 2 outdoor cameras with the 2 way audio, and were so happy with the video and audio quality, we bought another add on outdoor camera, the next month.
A year later we found the mini indoor cameras. We have one for a child's bedroom and one for the playroom. The video and audio quality is great.
A year after that we bought another 3 outdoor Cameras, again video and audio quality is great.
Just before Christmas 2021 Blink came out with the doorbell camera, and we purchased it. One, because it was blink and 1/2 the price of a ring doorbell camera. Two, because the doorbell that came with our new build home was so quiet, we couldn't ever hear the bell ring.

Blink offers two subscription plans.

1 Blink device
$3 per month or $30 annually

Unlimited Blink devices
$10 per month or $100 annually

You do not have to have a Blink Subscription if you do not choose to, but you won't be able to store videos.

With the subscription you are even able to share your videos by text, or email. To neighbors, Friends, Family, and even the police department.

Cons/irritations
When an outdoor camera faces the sun at any point of the day, the motion detection will go off, until you adjust the motion activity spots in the camera settings. This can take a few days to work out the kinks.
Indoor mini cameras the motion activity spots don't always work. Sometimes it will go off when there is motion in the grayed out zones, and sometimes not go off in the non-greyed out zones. This maybe human error on our part. We are looking for a longer cord for the mini's to mount on the wall or ceiling. The are options to rotate the camera view, so that you are able to mount the camera wherever you need.

Overall we are happy with our Blink system and hope the company continues to grow and come out with new products.

Compared to my parents very very expensive Arlo system, Blink is more reliable, and is more cost-effective. So much so, my parents have ditched the Arlo camera system and have purchased a new Blink system.

24,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, motion detection, Works with Alexa",$34.99 - $49.99,4,"I have several of both the Minis and the outdoor models, and this Mini is almost identical to the outdoor and indoor models in terms of quality and features. The only real difference between them is the Mini isn't weather-proof, cannot handle the extreme temperatures of the outdoor models (-4 to 113 F), has a better mount, can be image-flipped, and runs solely on a power adapter instead of batteries.

* Not Weather-proof: DO NOT use this mini camera outdoors or in an uninsulated building. It is not water-proof and will likely be damaged by humidity and high or low temperatures.

* Mount & Image Flipping: this mount is great and allows easier installation locations than the indoor and outdoor cameras, because it's mounted from the bottom/top instead of the back. Since this Mini can be mounted from the bottom or top, this means it can be turned at many more angles on all 3 axes than the Indoor/Outdoor. If you have to mount it upside-down, such as from a ceiling, the app simply allows you to flip the image vertically. The problem with the indoor/outdoor models is the mounting is on the back, which means you can't ""hang"" it from a ceiling and point it in any direction. Instead, if you want to mount the Indoor/Outdoor on a ceiling or near the ceiling, you have a very small angle to point it. This makes the Indoor/Outdoor cameras inconvenient to install from above in most situations because you'll end up having to point the camera directly outward from your mounting surface. If from a ceiling, it'll face down. If from the top of a wall, it'll face outward along the ceiling. The Mini's mount is much better.

CONS:

* The ""Talk"" feature is totally useless. Regardless of bandwidth or proximity to the router or a sync module (purchased separately), the Talk feature produces broken sound that is impossible to understand. Plus there's a long delay of 3-6 seconds, making this feature useless for conversations, even if the other person understood anything you were saying. Over several tests with all of our different Blink cameras, none of them produce clear enough speech that someone can understand you, no matter where the cameras are located.

* No wired Ethernet option. This camera can only be used with a wireless router and Internet connection. There are no other options.

* Cannot be used as a USB web cam

* Cannot be used for continuous live feeds. The live feed only allows up to 30 seconds of viewing, and you must hit a Continue button every 30 seconds to keep it going. So if need a camera to leave running for frequent live video, Blink isn't what you're looking for.

* Cloud Storage Subscription semi-requirement: the Blink Home Monitor App's features become limited if you don't purchase a cloud storage subscription. If you stick with the Sync Module for local storage and do not purchase any of the cloud storage plans, VIDEO CLIPS CANNOT BE VIEWED THROUGH THE APP. The app will only allow you to view the live feed, adjust camera settings, and use the Talk feature. Without a cloud storage subscription, the only way to view your camera's video clips is by physically taking your USB storage device (purchased separately) out of the Sync Module (purchased separately) and placed in a USB port on a computer (purchased separately).

To be very clear here, if you do not purchase a cloud storage subscription, you will not be able to view any of the stored video clips (including motion-activated clips) from your phone. Period. This point has not been made clearly anywhere in the advertisements, support screens, Amazon product pages, or Blink Web site, but it's a crucial piece of information that the company is being very ambiguous about.

To repeat, IF YOU DON'T PURCHASE A CLOUD STORAGE SUBSCRIPTION, YOU CANNOT VIEW YOUR VIDEO CLIPS THROUGH YOUR PHONE. I have seen some reviewers assert that this isn't technically possible, but as a software engineer I know this isn't true. The Blink developers clearly focused on developing the cloud storage and subscriptions, using the mobile app as the user's ""portal"" app to access and view the cloud-stored video clips, and have simply decided not to develop a mechanism for the mobile app to access the video clips stored in your Sync Module. I want to be very clear here....this IS POSSIBLE and would require a lot of development to accomplish, but Blink just doesn't provide this functionality (yet). Whether they are working on this feature and plan to add it in the future is unknown. But the lack of direct integration between the mobile app and the Sync Module's local storage (over the local network, especially) is a significant shortcoming in the entire Blink system. This also means that if your camera loses its internet connection, it will not capture video, you can't view the live feed, the Talk feature won't work, and you can't change the camera's settings.. The Blink system simply does not allow the mobile app to connect directly to a camera or Sync Module on your local network. It is designed to use the Internet only. This is a very important point that customers must understand. Both the camera and the Sync Module require an active Internet connection to function. They will not work independently or with just a wifi router. Internet is required.",positive
25,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, motion detection, Works with Alexa",$34.99 - $49.99,4,"I already have three blink outdoor cameras which I purchased over 2 years ago. I've had no problems with them and I've never had to sign up for a subscription.
I wanted to add this camera as an indoor camera to keep an eye on my pets during the day. As soon as I hooked it up and synced it with my app and module a pop-up came up about a free trial. I decided that I did not want the free trial and the pop-up ad never went away on my usual viewing of my cameras on my app. After the supposed trial was up I lost all motion detecting and live viewing from my new mini blink indoor camera. I was under the impression when I purchased it that I could still get motion detect and live view when I requested, just not live recording. Nothing that I did seemed to matter. I absolutely couldn't even use the camera anymore for anything not even motion detect. It's amazing to me how that as soon that trial (that I did not want to take a part of ended) so did the use of my camera. So I unplugged it and I sent it back. Now the advertisement about the free trial will not come off of my screen when I open my app. I'm not sure if this is their way of forcing me to use the paid subscription. It's a shame because I really did like my indoor blink camera but I'm not going to be forced into a subscription. I only needed it for motion detecting which it did just fine until that trial ended. In my book that's a scam. I suggest you try to do better Blink. I guess I'll be purchasing some rogue indoor camera. I would have loved to have stuck with Blink.",positive
26,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, motion detection, Works with Alexa",$34.99 - $49.99,5,"I’ve been reading a lot of reviews on google and other places on these mini cameras and a lot of people said they were crap and others said they were amazing. All I’m going to say is that it’s a great deal! Probably spend $50 tops for a camera that can pretty much sit anywhere as long as you can plug it in and it comes with a free month subscription to test! It’s absolutely amazing. I armed mine at night and went to take a picture in the Amazon app and as you can see I got notified immediately! The picture wasn’t even uploaded yet 🤣. It’s an amazing deal. You can pay $10 a month for the subscription after you use the free trial ($120yr) or you can pay $100 for a year up front which is to add multiple cameras. If you only need one it’s cheaper like I think $3 or $6 or something like that. Very easy on the wallet lol. I think it’s probably going to be the very cheapest security system that has that many perks. I can record live or it records for me if someone steps in my yard! It’s got great camera quality for the price. I thought it was going to be like crappy slightly pixelated but no it’s really decent actually. I’m really happy with my purchase and I plan on getting more cameras and adding them to the $100 a year plan.

27,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, motion detection, Works with Alexa",$34.99 - $49.99,4,"I bought three of these for security for my house. They worked well for the price with a few drawbacks.

I knew it would require a subscription after 30 days. I still bought them and I can’t say I’m happy I did but I’m also not sad about it. I decided not to subscribe and they still work, but with no features.

The night vision doesn’t work great if you are pointing these out a window to view outdoors. It shines on the glass making a very bright reflection so you that you cannot see outside. This would happen with any camera though so I’m not sure it’s really a big negative. If you use it as intended (not pointed at a reflective surface) it works great! You can adjust the brightness in camera settings.

The way you run the cord through the base and then clip it together is the worst design. I hope whoever designed it has to install 1000 of these every day for the rest of their life… it comes apart constantly even without touching it… be prepared to swear if you need to try and perch this somewhere difficult to reach.

I’m annoyed with paying subscription fees to use basic features. *This is the biggest drawback in my opinion, but I obviously knew about it when I purchased the product so…🤷🏻‍♀️

Positives
I stuck it outside my window all winter through negative temps (I’m in the Rocky Mountains and it gets COLD) and it still worked perfectly!

Basically you plug it in, point it _(fight with the base for 10 minutes) and connect with the app. It’s very simple to use.

Without a subscription, you can still use it to check the live view and you can screen record if you wanted too (no sound though with the screen record).

To be honest I never check the cameras anymore, and without alerts about motion detection, it’s not really good for security.
That being said, I moved one of mine to my bird cage so I can check in on my lil guy during the day while I’m away.💖🦜it works great for this odd purpose so that’s an unexpected bonus!

I probably wouldn’t buy again because I want to be able to save my clips without a subscription fee, and I’d rather have like a “personal system” that isn’t collecting my data and that I could control access too. But I’ll take what I can get because I don’t have much money and these were very cheap when I bought them.",positive
28,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, motion detection, Works with Alexa",$34.99 - $49.99,4,"Ok, I've given these things a shot, and I finally decided to write a review. I have two of these outside of my house with a ring doorbell. The motion detection is a joke... I have it set up to trigger within certain zones, because literally the wind blowing the trees will set it off... but apparently cars driving down my driveway to my house, coming IN MY HOUSE, and delivery drivers pulling up to the house do not set off the motion detection. Make sure to turn them off at night because bugs will fly in front of them and wig out the cameras setting off the motion detection. I have had them go off a dozen times at 3 am. Will definitely be shopping for something else.

UPDATE:
Matthew from Blink reached out to me about my concerns. I showed him a screenshot of what my cameras were seeing and the type of cameras I was using. He explained that the cameras I bought, were more designed for inside use. This was more than likely causing them to just not function the way I was expecting. He sent me a replacement outside camera and sync module so I could get setup for outside properly. Was super pleased with the support!",positive

30,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,5,"i LOVE this product so much, if i need to get another wifi camera, it will likely be another Blink.

I have not been compensated in any way, for this review.

Does everything ""as advertised"".

First - the bad news:

It should be mentioned there are two parts: the ""wall-mount bracket"" and the doorbell camera which attaches to the wall-mount.

This ""mounting bracket"" is horribly designed for its intended purpose (i.e. holding the doorbell camera against the door). Once the bracket is securely mounted to your door (or wall), it's *extremely* difficult to attach the camera to it. Even when following instructions - it required a great deal of strength to snap it in place.

I successfully did it two or three times, but at some point, i accidentally broke the little plastic clips that secure the camera in place.

Ultimately, problem solved by running a length of invisible scotch tape around the mounting bracket's edge, laying it on a flat surface (sticky side facing up), then carefully placing the camera down ""onto"" the bracket, and finally folding the tape UP and against the edge of the camera.

Once these two parts are together, then i take the assembly and ""stick"" to the door using adhesive strips (made by a well known stationery & adhesives supply co (think ""one more than '2L'.""))

I am ""NOT"" mechanically inclined. If you put a wrench in my hand - i won't know which end to use to screw in the nail! So take my word for it - using adhesive strips & scotch tape - if I could get this thing to stay on the wall securely - then you can too! As Mr Spock once said, ""Primitive but effective.""

In a couple pictures, if you look closely, you can see the tabs sticking out from beneath.

Also pictured (& you don't need to look all that closely) is extreme closeup (camera flash ON) so the tape is easily seen. However casual observation as you're standing at the door (even if you ring the bell), the tape is easily overlooked against the black plastic casing.

So while it's not ideal (indeed poorly designed), this bracket issue isn't a deal-breaker - especially for such an affordable price.

Now the good news!

OMG! Where to begin! BATTERY USE is nearly ""non-existent""! Put it this way: I've had my unit working for over three months, running on the same batteries it came with.

I live in an indoor building, and with neighbours, deliveries, etc - fairly high traffic / motion sensor triggered video 25 times in the past 24 hrs, and 33 times the previous 24 hrs. So that's just a little more than a 10-second video clip every hour.

For the past month - it's been on HIGH RESOLUTION (which uses more battery power), and longer clips both for ""motion"" as well as ""doorbell"" (this also uses more battery power).

So again - THREE MONTHS on the same batteries! Amazing! I should mention the batteries are Lithium (after tax & shipping, about $ 4 a piece). But i don't care. It's a great system! I love it.

This incredible battery-life / add to that it's ""feather weight"" - i don't mind using (& periodically changing) the adhesive strips - what? - ""every 3 or 4 Months""??

Blink Doorbell Camera works & plays well with Alexa. Because my office & Alexa are just inside our front door (i'm sort of the gatekeeper) - i don't want people hearing they've been detected - so rather than Alexa announcing ""Someone's at the door"" - instead, i have my office lights flash red & white. I also have it make a quiet ""ticking"" sound. On the other hand - my wife's office is far away from our front door, so in her case, Alexa simply says ""Someone's at the front door"".

Of course - the ""Blink"" app stamps the exact time each video clip was recorded (see image).

- - - - - -

Video Storage: They have an affordable cloud service ($3 per month at the time of this review), but i got the sync module so i don't need to pay for the extra cloud storage.

If my math is right - the extra cost for the Sync Module is about $ 36 - the same price you pay for a year of storage.

I strongly recommend the sync module over the pay service. Sync module works very well.

IMPORTANT: BLINK DOORBELL ONLY WORKS WITH 2.4G WIFI (i.e. it will not work on 5G).

I found this out the hard way, when i spent over a week, trying to figure out why i could no longer record video.

SIDE-NOTE: During this ""non-record week"", the unit DID still chime - both when motion was detected, as well as when the doorbell was pressed. Just no ""10-second recorded video"" of the chime.

Because of this issue - i also discovered ""Blink"" has a good, responsive tech support. Just be aware you must wait at least 48 hrs for them to respond. But they DO respond, and they're very helpful. :-)

Back story: one day, I suddenly couldn't record video, and sent them a service request. But before they got back to me - my camera was working again, and i couldn't figure out why (i thought it ""MIGHT"" be the 5G, but i wasn't sure).

So by the time they got back to me - i sent them an email saying Doorbell Camera was working again, i'm happy and issue Closed. Then (still not sure how/why it fixed itself) - i described my 2.4 / 5 G switch, and asked if that could have caused the problem? They replied ""YES"" and explained that 5G didn't work.

Again - this is ""AFTER"" i said it was working again (so at this point, they really didn't ""NEED"" to reply). And they REPLIED anyway! Personable and informative.

Not a ""BIG DEAL"", but if i had it to do over - i should have paid closer attention to COLOR! My door is mostly light & pastel colors (see picture). But my doorbell is BLACK, so aesthetically - it stands out a little more than it should. It's already sort of bulky from the get-go, so i wish i'd gotten the white one.

So again - overall this is an excellent system (& very AFFORDABLE too).

Get it! You'll be glad you did.",positive
31,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,4,"I am a long-time user of Blink, meaning I am in the ""grandfathered"" set of customers with free, limited cloud storage for video. Overall, I think if you are already a Blink customer, this is a good addition to your system.

Install: I needed one of those ""wedges"" that turns the camera to face out and using that, the install was pretty simple. I agree with the people that noted that the back plate it comes with (which you still use when installing the wedge) is a little cheap and janky. But the wedge is more sturdy and the resulting install is probably a little bit more solid and better than if I had just mounted the flat plate to the wall.
You do need a good sized piece of flat wood to screw everything into. This is not going to mount well to raw siding, curved trim pieces around doors etc. You'd have to attach a small board to the surface of anything like that and then mount it to that board.

Power vs. batteries: I have one of those wired doorbells that is old-school, with the metal strikers that hit little chimes, not a digital doorbell. This apparently matters because you need more power and a slightly larger transformer to drive one of those doorbells. In turn, that means the transformer has enough power to power the blink doorbell. If you have a digital doorbell you may (or may not) need to rely on the battery for the cameras. It all depends on how big the transformer for your existing, wired doorbell is. During the setup it asks you what kind of doorbell you have, and has a fairly sophisticated set of settings to make sure that when it sends a signal to the physical doorbell it is sending the correct amount of power to strike the chimes correctly.

Set-up: Very easy and painless, almost exactly the same as setting up a regular blink camera. Put in the batteries, scan the QR code, it finds the camera, links it to your existing system/sync module and you are ready to go.

Motion Sensor: If you are already pretty familiar with Blink cameras, you know they can come with one of two kinds of sensors to detect motion. Camera based sensors that just detect changes in the picture and more traditional sensors that only detect actual, physical movement. The cheaper Blink mini only has a camera based sensor, while the more expensive units only detect actual physical movement with a dedicated motion sensor. Both kinds of sensors can be triggered falsely by something like blowing leaves, but the camera-based sensors cannot distinguish changes in shadows and light from actual movement and so they have much higher rates of false detection. Unfortunately, the blink doorbell appears to only have the cheaper detector that can be fooled by changes in light. It does, however, have a more sophisticated, narrower grid of zones you can exclude from movement than the older Blink mini. How much this matters to you is going to depend on where you plan to stick the camera - if you point your doorbell camera directly at a busy road and don't lock out the parts of the image that covers the road, you will get constant alerts from every car that goes by, or every person walking on the sidewalk, etc. So think carefully about where the camera will sit and whether you want one of those wedges to tilt the direction of the thing to keep the camera aimed only at places where you actually want it to detect motion.

Video quality: Very good, with a wide angle, almost fish-eye lens, so you get very good broad coverage of the area you are pointing the camera at. There is also a microphone that records sound while you are recording video and it seems to work ok as well. In theory you can use the thing to have a two-way conversation with whoever is at the door, but I haven't tried that yet. I am, overall, very happy with the camera quality for the price here.

Sound Chime/notifications: When you push the doorbell, a chime inside the module itself goes off. It is reasonably loud and lets the person ringing the doorbell know they definitely rang it. The light on the button also lights up briefly to confirm the chime was pressed. Would you, sitting inside the house, hear the chime the doorbell makes outside? Probably, if you are in a small, quiet house. Would you hear it down in the basement of a large house with the TV or music on? Absolutely not. So if you are not hooking this up to an existing doorbell with a properly loud internal chime, then you will want to have it hooked up to your Alexa. I don't use Alexa so didn't test that feature. You do get a notification on your phone, when somebody rings the bell, but I think most people will want either a hard wired connection or an Alexa connected to this thing to make sure they always hear the doorbell.

What don't I like?

I wish it had the same motion detection sensors as the larger blink cameras. I would have paid more to get that. Because it uses the camera to sense motion there are places where it really won't give good results. So think very carefully about where you will place this, how often the wind will blow trees and create moving shadows within the motion detection zone, etc.

It is annoying that even when the device is hard-wired, the light around the doorbell button isn't constantly lit. Just as if it were only running on batteries, it only lights up when you press the button. Not a huge deal in my installation, but if you don't have a porch light on, your doorbell will not be obvious to visitors. It is particularly odd that they put a red LED into the thing which apparently has no purpose other than in the initial setup. The design would be much better if the lighted ring around the button was always lit and then it flashed or turned red when you pressed it. It appears all of the hardware necessary to do that is in the device, but it is not programmed that way. I get that when the device isn't hardwired you don't want the button lit, but when it is powered it really should be lit in the dark.

For $50, this thing is ok. If you get it on sale, then it is a good deal, at least if you are an existing Blink customer.

I am surprised that they killed off the little bit of free cloud storage for new customers. That can't cost very much to provide these days and it was the key differentiator between Blink and some of these other companies that provide more elaborate, high-priced options. Blink's claim to fame is that it works well enough and is cheap. But if you have to pay a bunch of money for cloud storage no matter what, I would probably look at the more expensive options vs. Blink. It stops being a compelling value once you start having to pay for video storage.",positive
32,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,4,"We have a front door that drivers keep leaving packages at despite an easy to read ""Please deliver all packages to back door"" sign mounted at eye level in front of the steps to the door. We also have a non-functional front door with steps, railing, and door knob all removed that they've left packages under. Sometimes even on the door to our deck on the opposite side of the house from the driveway (with no sidewalk leading there). We got 2 of these doorbells to see where TF they go in the front of the house when packages are not delivered to the back door as directed, and to monitor the back door. The front door had a wired bell with a bad button so it barely worked. The rear door did not have one so we previously used a simple wireless doorbell. After missing a UPS package that required a signature, we found the chime batteries were dead and decided it was time. With the Blink cameras we could at least monitor battery life via the app, and get alerted to a delivery if we weren't close enough to hear the chime. Or if the package was just dropped without ringing the doorbell.

We love being able to see what's going on, or what activity there was near a door, and even get an alert when someone pulls into our driveway due to the range of coverage.

However, the documentation is confusing. With both wired to our existing chime the cameras report ""external power OK"" instead of ""Battery OK"", so I'm not sure how to monitor battery life. Documentation on that is lacking, and the notification settings don't match what I see in Android 12. Documentation states the doorbell always runs on battery though, so the change in monitoring is confusing at first glance until you dig through FAQs for the official answer:

The Blink Video Doorbell closes the power circuit of your existing chime system, it does not provide power of any kind. If the chime system loses power for any reason, the doorbell only plays the Blink Chime sound and your existing chime will not activate.

I don't recall if this was covered in the FAQs/documentation I read before buying, but I found out during the install that I didn't need to make any changes to the wired chime like with Wyze (requires you to bypass the chime making it no long function so the doorbell can be powered) and other models. Install was so much easier than I expected, aside from having to run a new wire to our back door just to tie that doorbell into the wired chime. Now we'll be able to add another doorbell to our side door to monitor the deck without any wiring, and the sync module saves us the monthly cloud fee.

Motion capture has been a bit weird. I have field of view blocked off from the house side of the front sidewalk to the top of the view to ignore the street and nearby tree branches. Yet we still get motion alerts from the occasional car passing by on the street. Seems more frequent at night, especially vehicles with reflective paint/stickers (police cars, school buses, etc). Front door view is kind of dark, despite a nearby street light, but I don't want to turn up the IR intensity if it'll generate more alerts from traffic. I also walked the dog across the entire front lawn (the whole area I have set to monitor) during the day and it did not trigger a motion alert.

In the end, it's great getting the alerts we do. It was more than we got before, and the doorbell chimes should be more reliable now in addition to getting the phone alerts when out of hearing range of the wired chime. All for a reasonable price, with no monthly fees building up.

Edit 8/27/2022: The ""false alarms"" for the front door camera due to headlights from passing traffic at night, setting sun, etc have been eliminated with an angled mounting bracket. With the doorbell angled down, those alerts have stopped. And its better anyway as it covers more of the steps down from the door.",positive
33,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,5,"We purchased our first Blink Home Security Camera July of 2018. We were going out of the country and wanted to make sure our 18 year old son closed the garage door and locked the house. It did the job and we felt better knowing while on the other side of the world we could monitor our home.
The following Summer we were so happy with our indoor system, we decided to purchase 2 outdoor cameras with the 2 way audio, and were so happy with the video and audio quality, we bought another add on outdoor camera, the next month.
A year later we found the mini indoor cameras. We have one for a child's bedroom and one for the playroom. The video and audio quality is great.
A year after that we bought another 3 outdoor Cameras, again video and audio quality is great.
Just before Christmas 2021 Blink came out with the doorbell camera, and we purchased it. One, because it was blink and 1/2 the price of a ring doorbell camera. Two, because the doorbell that came with our new build home was so quiet, we couldn't ever hear the bell ring.
In total we now have...
3 Indoor battery powered
2 Indoor mini corded power
6 Outdoor battery powered

You do not have to have a Blink Subscription if you do not choose to, but you won't be able to store videos.

With the subscription you are even able to share your videos by text, or email. To neighbors, Friends, Family, and even the police department.

Cons/irritations
When an outdoor camera faces the sun at any point of the day, the motion detection will go off, until you adjust the motion activity spots in the camera settings. This can take a few days to work out the kinks.
Indoor mini cameras the motion activity spots don't always work. Sometimes it will go off when there is motion in the grayed out zones, and sometimes not go off in the non-greyed out zones. This maybe human error on our part. We are looking for a longer cord for the mini's to mount on the wall or ceiling. The are options to rotate the camera view, so that you are able to mount the camera wherever you need.

Overall we are happy with our Blink system and hope the company continues to grow and come out with new products.

Compared to my parents very very expensive Arlo system, Blink is more reliable, and is more cost-effective. So much so, my parents have ditched the Arlo camera system and have purchased a new Blink system.

We highly recommend Blink to anyone who would like to have a home video camera system that works, and won't break the bank.
We love that you can start out small and work your way in to as much as you want/need.",positive
34,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,5,"I have an Echo Show 5 and a Blink module 1, so I was worried whether this would work from all the reviews that said it didn't work with show and the details that said you need module 2. But, it works great and was super easy setup! I just opened the blink app on my android phone, tapped plus sign to add device, selected device, it had me scan the QR code that came with door bell, I put in the batteries, app scanned and found it quickly, let me rename it and choose all my settings. For my echo show, I already had the Blink skill enabled for my Blink security cameras, and I got a notification on my phone that alexa found new device without me doing anything. I mounted the doorbell easily on porch, I did not wire to existing doorbell. I rang the bell, and it rang on my phone and announced from my echo show. I said ""Alexa answer the doorbell"", show said ""ok"" and brought up the live feed quickly, there was a mic button I tapped to turn on mic, spoke and my voice came from doorbell! Great picture on echo, love that I can 2 way talk and see who is there. And with the module 1, it has free cloud storage. Very happy with purchase! Maybe those who couldn't work it with their Show didn't have a module, I don't know, but works great with module 1.",positive
35,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,5," If you are like me you are a happy existing Blink Camera user who is thinking about adding the door bell to your existing setup. I had a blink camera setup aiming at my front door so at first I was not too sure that I really needed the door bell. However for the cost I am very glad I got one. There are a couple of things to know:

(1) If you are an existing Blink customer, you do not need a second sync module. All you need is the door bell and you can simple add it to your existing account (as easy as adding an additional camera).

(2) If you are planning on hardwiring the blink doorbell to your existing doorbells wires. . . . you still have to use 2 AA batteries to power the camera. This did not make sense to me as I figured my hardwires would power it, but sure enough after calling Blink support I realized I needed to put the AA batteries in the camera. The hard wire will allow your blink doorbell to ring the doorbell in your home but will not power the camera.

(3) You can turn on motion detection or just have the blink door bell turn on when the door bell is rung. This is a nice feature. If you want to catch anyone that comes to your door (whether they ring the bell or not, you can simple turn this feature on in the app). If you want to save battery life and are only interested in door bell ringers you can turn motion detection off.

(4) It has two way audio, meaning you will always hear the person at your door. . . . but you can also choose to speak to the person if you choose. For me the audio the person at the door hears comes across a little staticky, but that could be my phone or the fact that I am using the corner mount.

(5) It has more of a fish bowl view so it catches a wide view (meaning it can cover most of your front porch)

(6) There is no additional cost to having the Blink doorbell or camera system. Unlike other door bell systems out there, there is no additional cost to the Blink Doorbell. The app is free, cloud storage is free, downloading images or videos is free, etc.

If you are looking to set it up with just batteries and no wiring to an existing doorbell system, setup is a breeze (will take two minutes). If you are looking to hard wire it, it is still pretty easy. I am not a handy man and what I know about electricity will shock you (get my joke) but even I was able to hard wire it. Get the doorbell, you will be glad you did. Hope this review helped.",positive
36,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,5,"I opted in for Blink as: (1) I do not want to subscribe to any cloud storage. This unit can store images on local storage units (any flash drive would do). (2) I do not need any best quality picture; just good enough to identify the subjects. It turned out that this unit sends high quality pictures even in ""Standard"" mode (not ""Highest quality"" mode) anyway.
My door faces a street with some traffic, but I was able to block out car movements by highlighting dark areas on the app. With a few trial and error, I was able to minimize false alarms. I also put the sensitivity level to 3. Even at that level, it detects any humans who approach the door.
Since Blink is owned by Amazon, it can easily be connected to other Amazon devices. Currently I am using Echo as a doorbell announcer (Alexa does that). You'd need something indoor (old fashioned bell or digital devices), as you may not be able to hear the ring sound outside the door, and you may not have your phone with you at all times.
Strongly recommended for budget conscious home owners who may not care for the best quality pictures and fancy features.",positive
37,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,4,"I'm usually not one to write a bad review because I feel as if it's just me fumbling the bag but with the Blink, I have found many other peole with the same problems (THAT ARE FIXABLE) but with no answers anywhere online and the support just repeats what the websites FAQ already says. My biggest problem with this doorbell is how misleading it is. It does work as a doorbell. It does record when the button is clicked. It does record IF motion is detected. It does let me view on my phone but theres a catch which is nowhere (very hard to find) clarified before purchase. On battery only, you can only view the camera if it notifies you that something is happening. Otherwise you cannot just view it whenever you want, unless you buy a seperate sync module and usb stick with enough storage to support constant footage. Or you can hard wire your doorbell but it still won't let you live view unless you unsync the whole sustem through the app and resync it again. Instead of them telling you, you have to do that, it lets you just swap setup in settings without unpairing but THAT DOES NOT WORK. I tried researching and could not find answers at all and thought I was going to return the product. Once you get through the few problems there are with no support or proper informational help, the product is great. The camera quality is not much worse than rings which is fine considering the huge price difference. Motion detection is a little iffy but Id rather it detect 1 out of 5 cars driving by then not detect a person walking up and taking my packages. Sensitivity is customizable but in my use lowering it makes it not pick up people very well. The app is decent, sometimes doesnt work but overall good. Product and app are good but setup can be terrible.",positive
38,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,5,"So, my husband and I really disagreed about getting a Blink doorbell. He was really against any video doorbell, but he relented and we agreed to get it. Well, it was extremely easy to install. It took me with my upper body strength of a kitten under two minutes to install. I synced it up and it was completely easy to get going.

Or so I thought. I ran into two issues: 1) we live on a very busy street, and the cars on the street triggered the motion sensor every five minutes; and 2) only the person pressing the doorbell could hear it ring.

After a few weeks, I had to admit that my husband was right. The Blink doorbell was horrible.

Then, I set about problem solving.

For the first problem, I had already tried adjusting the motion sensor’s sensitivity by one setting, but when I did that, the doorbell didn’t even detect motion when someone went up to it and waved to it. So, I googled it and one suggestion was to get a wedge mount. I installed it this week and it worked perfectly. I have no idea how—I can’t tell the difference between the pictures it took before and after the wedge mount—but it works. Cars no longer set off the motion detector, and it detects when people go into our yard/porch. Perfect!

With the second issue, I looked for chimes like the one the Ring camera has, but there isn’t one for Blink. Then, I looked to see whether I could set it to alert through our Echo and Echo dots. We live in an old house that has no light switches, so we have smart lighting and use Alexa to turn on the lights. I hadn’t checked before because I did not realize we wouldn’t be able to hear the door bell. Once I checked and found that you could enable the Alexa skill to notify you when your doorbell rings, it was great. When someone pressed the Doorbell, Alexa says “There is someone at the front door.”

With those two adjustments, my husband actually said, “You know, I actually like this doorbell.”

The great thing with using the Echo devices for doorbell press notifications, is that you can put your Echo devices in do not disturb mode, so say your two-year-old is napping, you can set the Echo in his room on do not disturb and the doorbell won’t wake him up. Brilliant!

If we didn’t already have several Echo devices in our house, it would not have been a good purchase for us, as we could not hardwire it into an existing door chime. This is really best as an accessory to Echo—it’s not a stand alone device.

Though, I’m not sure what the Echo Show really brings to the table. If you have a smart phone, you can see who is at the doorbell and communicate with them. Walking over to a specific Echo Show to do so, when you’re probably already carrying your phone, does not make sense to me.",positive
39,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,3,"We bought 2 of these - because our house didn't have working doorbells ... and we couldn't hear people at the door. And that was a problem.

We got them activated, then it took a little while before we could get them installed. I think we missed our 2 week free trial entirely. But, it takes a while to get things done while unpacking.

The day we put them up, we lost internet for 3 days. They don't work without internet.

Finally, we had them up and running.

They are S L O W .... I watched the mailman ring the doorbell ... set down the packages ... and leave. As the truck was driving away, my phone chimed ... about 20 seconds.

My son has enjoyed them. He can talk with me from the garage door or front door. I can open the Blink app to watch the live video. My husband even gets the doorbell while he is driving around town.

Maybe we need to get the services that go with these ... I didn't think about extra monthly charges when I ordered them.... service is by Blink, a company of Amazon.

My ""Show"" doesn't seem to be able to connect to the devices .. one of the big reasons that we chose Blink doorbells is so we could see them from our Show devices.

Overall, not impressed.

I've never gotten the motion detection to work. Night vision has not been tested.

But since they are fully installed, I'm not removing them to send them back.

Update after nearly 3 months:

Great:

You can talk to people IF you open the app. But having the app open all the time is hard on your phone batteries.

Easy to install

We are still on the first batteries, and the front gets a lot of traffic.

It is easy to pause them if you plan to work near the camera range to avoid constant notifications. (ONCE you know where to find it on the app)

If your app is working. It can be fun to scare the kids working near the camera... ""I see you!"" Ahem. It can be great tool to talk to the person at the door. Especially if you don't want to open the door.

The range of vision is HUGE. The resolution is great. You can usually get good details.

The Ugly:
The delay is so long, that people sometimes walk away before you know that they arrived. They hear the bell. You hear it 10 to 20 seconds later IF you have sound up on your phone.

No matter how hard I've tried, it doesn't really interact with my Echo Show. That connection seems to do nothing. I expected it to act like an indoor doorbell, and then show me the camera view. I expect my dots to chime. But nothing happens.

Images only show on the app cloud storage. You can buy a device to store data at home. But I wish I could view the picture from the doorbell 2 minutes later when I get the notification!
Which leads to ... you HAVE to get that subscription if you want this to function as a camera.

NEED TO IMPROVE:
They need a dedicated box you can mount inside the house that has a loud CHIME when the doorbell is pushed. OR get this feature to work with your dedicated Alexia devices. Doorbell is pretty worthless if the only person who hears it is the person who pushed the doorbell. .... Yeah, it chimes OUTSIDE!

Need to be able to pull open the app and activate the camera to see outside on demand (like I do with the Blink mini cameras).",fair
40,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"All-new Ring Video Doorbell (2nd Gen) – 1080p HD video, improved motion detection, easy installation",$84.99 - $164.98,3,"I had the original Ring Doorbell for about a year and really enjoyed it. It was cheap but lower quality video resolution. It was fine for the time I had it. When the same thing with improved video was being released, I jumped on it. I received it today and got it installed. The video quality is night and day as shown in the photos and much better than the 1st generation. Good work ring. Unfortunately, the installation and mounting sucks compared to the 1st generation. Why they did this, I have no clue but here are the issues.

1. The mounting plate on the first generation has connections for the wiring. This made it very easy to remove the device and charge, especially in the winter months where we live and the batteries lose charge. 2nd generation has a mounting plate and the wiring on the back of the unit, which was a pain especially when the existing wire is not very long. This will be a nightmare having to remove this and recharge compared to the 1st generation. I had no issues with the 1st generation. This is a failure for Ring in my opinion. I am debating about keeping my 1st generation instead of this now.

2. The mounting of the device to the frame also sucks. The 1st literally had no gaps and was secure in my opinion. It had guides that made the doorbell align to the mount. The 2nd generation does not and there are gaps all the way around and loose. I mounted it no differently than before, in fact the holes for 1st and 2nd generation are identical which is a plus, but again I see this mounting as a failure for Ring.

I literally just installed this, and outside of the perfect video, I can’t attest to motion and nightvision yet. I am disappointed in the execution of mounting the device. I have no idea why this changed this from the 1st generation but this was a bad move in my opinion. I still have no idea why these require a battery they never stay charged when connected to wiring, but I assume this unit will have the same issue for me as well come winter. They really need to rethink the whole battery idea and have a hardwired version and battery version or fix the way these thing function when power is applied. At this point I may deal with it and hope Ring fixes these mounting and wiring flaws. If this mounted the same way as the 1st generation, I would not be writing a review because I had no issues with the device other than the battery and that wasn’t enough for me to write a review. Excellent otherwise but seriously why did you change the way these mount?

***Update 6/6/2020***

So I decided to keep it primarily because I had already offered to sell my 1st generation to a neighbor, but I did end up having to make some changes. Ultimately I bought some spade terminals and soldered them to my doorbell wire with heat shrink tubing (Ring provided in older versions, but not this one for some reason). While it was easy for me, it won’t be for others. Overall I am still upset over this mounting as it is extremely poor execution when the previous version was perfect. I guess this is Rings way to get the price down to $99 by cutting corners. The doorbell it self seems quality but mounting just plain sucks. I have no other words for it. You can see my updated photos of what I did. There are two photos that show the camera quality difference. The low quality image is from a generation 1 ring and the better quality HD is from the generation 2 ring. Night vision appears to be decent and motion the jury is still out because of the People only filter. I am still trying to tweak it. I am still leaving only 3 stars because of the mounting issues and there is still a gap between the mounting plate and the doorbell. Maybe Ring will fix and send everyone a new mount, but that is wishful thinking.",fair

I got it and had issues with it not picking up people standing directly in front of it. I'd test it and it wouldn't pick me up until I walked away and was turning a corner. Called tech support 4 times trying to get it figured out, and finally we got it going. (Support people were very nice.)

It's MOSTLY 100% now. I think one problem was that I had set up a package zone to tell me when packages arrive. Don't waste your time. It's worked one time. Once I turned it off, it did a much better job of detecting people.

It still misses the mail carrier here and there. The carrier has to walk directly towards the camera and then stand in front of it, about a foot away, to put mail in the box. Should be easy to detect.

Night vision is amazing. Connects to my wifi and my Alexa with ease.

In a brutal winter where it was like negative 30 and in need of a recharge the plastic front broke off into pieces. I ordered this as a replacement, and it looks a lot classier and hopefully its metal--I'm pretty sure it is. Either way, it charges differently and does not require the face plate to be removed so hopefully breaking in cold weather won't be an issue. For functionality I've always been a fan of these things.

I plan on buying the solar attachment so the battery will stay charged. Depending on your settings, it can run about 3 months before you need to take it down for charging. This is pretty accurate. I’ve only charged it once since I’ve had it. Still, the solar attachment will keep it charged for you so it makes sense to get it.",positive

After reviewing videos and doing some research and talking to her about the system, we installed the bells and tested out the app. It was everything we were expecting and more! We can also edit the range so we don’t pick up motion from the road. It’s a little trial and error but pretty easy to zone in. It did rain the other night but it did not detect the rain - something I wondered about. So far we’ve used it for 4 days and are very happy with it!

Thank you, Ring Customer Service!

The doorbell seems to work fine, the Spotlight Camera, not so much. The doorbell sees delivery people at the front door, but the driveway camera doesn't see them at all, and the only way to the front door is up the driveway!

Have it hardwired to a 18V AC plug in transformer with 500mA current output, and it is working well so far. Contrary to the reviewer who thought it was poorly designed for install, I prefer this install. The wires being connected directly to the doorbell body means that the wires are shielded from rain, unlike the first generation doorbell where the supply wires were connected to the doorbell mount and the doorbell made physical connection with sprung pins against solder pads on the mount, to acquire charge. This is just a much better connection and means charging will be faster.

My Mom purchased a Gen 2 and it wasn't much better than mine so you can understand that I was very hesitant to purchase anything else made by RING.
When Amazon had its recent sale, they lowered the price of an updated (2020) version of the Gen 1, claiming it was much better.
I decided to roll the dice and spent the $79.99 and purchase this updated unit and see for myself it was any better.
I installed it today and OMG! what a difference...The picture is so much clearer and seems to have a wider-angle view...Best of all the motion detection is almost real time fast.
On my old unit it would detect the motion about 4-5 seconds after someone come to the door and usually all I would see on replay was their back as they were walking away.

It came linked to my Amazon account so all I had to do was enter our wi-fi password and Amazon password and it was up and running; very easy setup. Just to test it out we played some music and video clips. Picture quality is very good in my opinion. Sound quality is just good. Being a smaller unit I guess I shouldn't expect it, but it does not have near the low end frequency the Show 8 has. The Show 8 will blow you away and shake the counter top if you turn it up. I suppose I got spoiled with it haha. Don't get me wrong, it will get loud but it is missing deep/thumping tones. A couple of things to note and the reason for removing a star (aside from the lackluster low end frequency) camera angle is not quite what it should be and time/date problem. I had read many reviews before ordering this that mentioned the camera angle being a problem for them so I proactively purchased the stand for the Show 5 at the same time. It's a good thing I did since the camera angle didn't work for us where it's new home is. The little stand fixed that. The time/date problem was something else. Technically it was my fault, but I should not have had to adjust it. The time/date is set automatically and you can not adjust it from the screen. After searching for time/date problems with this unit I noticed most advised checking the time zone. The only way to do that is through the app (guess there is a way to do it through Amazon site too but didn't look there). Downloaded the app and checked my devices. Sure enough the new Show 5 was set to the wrong time zone. I confirmed the address which includes city and state were correct from the Show's display. Why would I need to change the time zone when the Show knows where it is (city and ST) and it's registered to my account with the other devices all in this time zone. Anyway, corrected the time zone and it has been fine since so now I can use it as an alarm clock too. If you have a larger space to put one, I would recommend the Show 8 over the 5, but this overall is very nice if you only have a smaller space to put one or cannot afford the higher price of the 8..",positive

I haven't used for video conferencing but have watched streamed content from various sources and it works well.
I wanted something inconspicuous for the nightstand and this little box is great for that. The fact that you can link devices together for music play is great and this device additionally will display the lyrics when playing Amazon music. I find the multi room music a great feature when connecting the dots (get it?) to the Show. It's nice to walk from room to room and not miss a beat and would be especially good for party gatherings.

The screen on this Show is necessarily small, but I don't find this a problem if you are viewing close up. If you need something you can see and read from the other side of a room, there are other size options available. The picture quality is fine and the touch screen features seems to work well.

If I had to find one fault, it would be the camera angle. Given that the box is fixed form, if placed on a level surface, the screen slants slightly upwards from that plane which is not ideal if you want to use the device to spy on your dog chewing your best leather shoes on the floor, for example. Yes, there are solutions to change the angle of the screen more towards horizontal, but these are either a makeshift lift or buffer to the rear casing or the purchase of a stand accessory which allows the pivot of the screen in multi directions. Not a huge deal but I think future designs would benefit from some screen pivot capability built in.

All in all, I like this size Show and am happy with my choice. Recommended for folks who want a discrete, minimalist box with all the Alexa functional goodies and great video built in.",positive

Or it could have been the fact that I rebooted my modem, but the bottom line turned out to be that the Show 5 was basically waiting for me to finish the set up. Which I did. And yes, it IS basically an Echo Dot with a screen that is way too small to do much of anything beyond telling what the song playing is or the temperature or the time. But that is quite okay. I read in other reviews about the ""problems"" of playing a netflix movie or whatever video you care to mention with the Show 5, the lack of deep base audio, etc..Really?

So yeah, the Show 5 is what it is, nothing more and nothing less. And for some of us, that is enough.",positive
53,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen, 2021 release) | Smart display with Alexa and 2 MP camera | Charcoal",$39.99,5,"So the secret is I purchased the Echo Show 5 2nd Gen solely as an “add-on” bc it only cost me an additional $10 as part of a Prime Day Deal (w the purchase of 3 Blink Outdoor Cameras- which I love)

The pros are that it’s extremely easy to set up (uhhh, just plug it in), has great voice recognition, decent screen quality, and it’s the perfect size for me on the night stand (neither too big nor too small). I also like the clock feature(s) and all the different ummm apps? which you can download to use on the ES5 (like Netflix). Now, that being said, I haven’t watched a single thing of substance on it yet (no movies, videos, video calls) bc I have my iPad, iPhone, etc. for all of that stuff.

I also like all of the different settings and features available, allowing you to customize your ES5 screen(s).

Finally, I like how you can easily block the front-facing camera on the home screen so no bored pervs at Amazon can watch me sleep.

Now, the one negative … WHICH I 100% KNEW GOING IN … So it’s not really a fair knock … BUT unless you’re willing to pay substantially more (at least in the Prime Day deal I was offered), you can’t select one single Lock Screen for the ES5 to display all the time (such as an alarm clock face or the weather forecast). Instead, it’s always scrolling through various screens.

Now, you absolutely CAN get all the information you need on the screen at times; but, unless you pay extra, your ES5 screen will also contain auto-scrolling nonsense as it shuffles through various faces (stocks, scores, weather, pics, etc.). I’d love to be able to use the Home Screen solely as a weather station or solely as an alarm clock, both while I’m using it (as a speaker) and while I’m not using it at all. To be fair. I’ve really only used it as a Bluetooth speaker so far, and it’s been really good for that limited purpose.

Again, in full disclosure, I only purchased the Echo Show 5 2nd Gen as an inexpensive add-on to a Prime Day deal, so keep in mind it’s always possible (likely) I’m only tapping like 3% of it’s actual abilities, but that’s ok too, bc I’ve been really satisfied with it as a Bluetooth speaker so far.

Final thoughts- If you can get it as an inexpensive add-on as part of another deal/item, that would be ideal. However, it’s still a good + solid product that delivers as promised, which may not sound like much, but is actually quite the rarity these days.

FINAL VERDICT: SOLID BUY … as long as the price is right",positive

I really enjoy it More than was expecting! & would not mind a larger screen in the future. But the screen is lovely, similar to a smart phone. Having Amazon prime is probably a benefit. Its fun to watch shows, listen to music & see the words! It works immediately, needs internet connection. The sound is better than the dot. I put in the kitchen for recipes & company. We will probably buy another. Yes! Perhaps the screen size up, if in our budget 🤞🏽😁. It would be great for the Grandparents with the Voice commands, they could call us! Onsale the Show 5 is absolutely A Yes! 😄. If the larger one is in your Budget - get it!
Have had about a month, still learning yet quite happy with the purchase. Especially if you are getting ""smart"" lights, etc. Does need to be plugged in to work (cord included) & no aux plug, but a mini usb next to the power plug. Ours came with a white power cord connected 2 prong plug., yet our show is black. Not a big deal. They should match though.
Overall. Recommended - especially if you have dots or other shows. 👏🤗",positive
55,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen, 2021 release) | Smart display with Alexa and 2 MP camera | Charcoal",$39.99,4,"To start off with. I bought this on prime day 2022. I also bought the blink security cameras on the same day because they were also cheaper! I honestly never considered getting one of these until I got to looking at the cameras and realized that this works as a hub of sorts for the security cameras as well. You can see any of your cameras from this device. Another reason I bought it is because I can watch videos on it. I wasn’t sure what all video apps it would allow but come to find out it allows all of them. This thing is super loud, small enough to not be in my way and large enough to see the screen well from my bedside table. I am moving (that’s why I bought the cameras) and am trying to figure out the setup already for the new place. I’ve decided I don’t need a tv in my room. I’m going to decorate the walls the way I want and not worry about that at all. This will work perfectly for those late nights in bed when I want to watch a few episodes of something as I pass out. Basically this is an awesome smart alarm that doesn’t wake me unless I need or he woke and also has a brightness option so it’s not to bright at night. If you want to customize it this will do it. It currently is showing my photos that I’ve chosen to go across the screen as a screen saver. Also like all phones this pulls down to the screen that I’ve showed in the photos. This is much better quality than I’d ever thought. I spent around $30 for this and don’t regret it a bit. I also have decided to get several more. Side note this has a sliding thing to turn off mic and camera whenever you choose! And I can also set it up for movement detection to see who comes in my room as it will send me a notification. I can also drop in so to speak like with the other Amazon devices but also view what’s going on in the room at the same time. If I had to change one thing I guess it would be maybe the quality of the little camera I’ll be using while I’m at work to see if the kiddos sneak in there to and get into my stuff like I’ve suspected lol. You’ll love it!",positive
56,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen, 2021 release) | Smart display with Alexa and 2 MP camera | Charcoal",$39.99,4,"So for the most part, I like this Echo show because the screen is vibrant, the pictures show up clearly and I love the ability to connect with other smart home devices. It’s also nice to have a camera built in that I can slide off to block the lense when I’m at home. Here is what I don’t like; the response when saying your wake up word is hit and miss so you sometimes have to say it several times, when the wake up word is recognized the response is slow, I can’t turn the camera on or off from my app, my notifications give one soft chime and if I miss it, the only visual indicator is a tiny red dot on the screen that you can hardly see, the pictures are like a 3-panel overlapping so they look weird at times, there are too many picture advertisements intervals and the screen goes to sleep so you don’t even see what time or date it is anymore and the speaker really sounds cheap.

I have another one that has the digital clock on the speaker and a notification ring light at the bottom so I have found that I use that one more since the notifications on the echo show are unreliable and the time is more visible. I also think the speaker sounds a tad bit better.

Like I said though, for the most part I like the smart functions and app on the Echo show so ill deal with the glitches until they improve this. I’ll be keeping it and got my son one too. The technology for our smart home products is the best for user friendliness and accessibility.",positive
57,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen, 2021 release) | Smart display with Alexa and 2 MP camera | Charcoal",$39.99,4,"This is my second Echo, so in that respect it truly is an Echo of what I can control and automate in the home. One item I would like to point out in this day and age is the Physical privacy shutter on the camera, I won't buy a laptop without it, so why should I not insist it on other devices, excellent

I have used the Echo as an alarm clock, to check my security cameras from another vendor, control lights and more. It's small enough to place in a variety of locations and it's that ""missing link"" to turnkey integration of a complexity of devices with little effort.

If Alexa offers it, the Echo Show can control it and '""show"" much more on it's display screen whether the weather or news or songs lyrics or yes that basic digital clock look.

It has the ability to auto dim so it's not too overpowering in a dark room for those that are light phobic in the bedroom. It can double as a white noise generator if other sounds are a distraction, provide sea sounds and a variety of others by just asking.

Is it listening, Yes, but that's up to you how you enforce by checking and reviewing logs, and if that's bad then consider how it can add to home security options, it goes both ways. Consider that any online browser puts more details out there than the features of Alexa. And what tasks you link or don't are up to you, be it one or two or many.

Although it would be nice to see a home server item offered in the future than can localize tasks a bit better for the ultimate disruption proofing of connectivity.

On that issue of power loss and disruptions, a set once and truly a ""forget it"" device, it recovers on its own, so no more chasing flashing clocks, or the constant reprogramming that plagues so many lesser devices each time the power burps.

Voice recognition is a 4 out of 5, there are a few background noises that can impede accuracy or response, but it's often no more than simply yelling at the kids to literally ""turn the music down"" as that's one feature that sometimes is too loud and can delay recognition of a command.

On that issue of sound quality it's good, not on the deep bass level of a Sonos or Apple speaker but consider nor is it a ""one trick pony"" speaker with little else to offer. It can fill a room with sound and a good presence and that's fine for a device in such a small package.

Is it fool proof, foolish to consider or an item to foolish not be without? Well that's all in how you implement it and weigh the pluses and minuses and the limits you extend to a variety of available functions, features and options. It has been less of a headache than chasing a mix of dumb devices one at a time with the Automation for us than the later of automatically sending us scurrying from device to device. As with any automation device planning is ""key"" to success, but with that said it is a solid performer within logical boundaries and a bit of preparation.",positive

Originally we had just the speakers, but every time there’s a deal I grab another ES5, or an ES8 if I can manage it, and am slowly replacing the older speakers. My toddler especially loves Alexa because he can ask her to play his music—-and she’s learned to understand him really well. He also loves to watch cartoons on the Show, and it makes it a lot easier for him because he can’t really navigate the TV alone yet.

Just about my ONLY complaint about the ES5 is that unlike it’s ES8 counterpart, there is no access to Hulu. I tend to use my ES’s in my office and workroom a lot, and I like to watch shows on them because it’s a lot cheaper than installing a small TV to watch stuff on when I’m working on projects—-except I tend to watch a lot of Hulu, so in my office where I only have a ES5, vs. an ES8, it remains a little frustrating. I can’t see a single reason why they don’t do Hulu on the 5. If they fixed that little issue it would be absolutely amazing!",positive
60,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",$29.99,1,"I hate this little device from hell. I used to love it. I bought one for every room in my house, my office at work, and they were good. But now, despite Amazon's alleged spying, some genius at Amazon decided to allow this thing to wake you up all hours of the night with a loud obnoxious noise and a bright yellow light. It will say you have a notification. Oh good, it must be a really good reason for Amazon to notify me of something mid sleep at 2 am on a Tuesday you ponder so you wake up the rest of the house by saying Alexa play notifications. Here's the best part, this little Alien Intelligence Robot without feet from hell will say Please rate the pair of shorts your wife bought last week, we need your review. Well I sure do love reviews, but at 2 am after being woken up to leave one, sadly I don't give a flying poopsicle about the shorts and a bug 1 star rating is all the revenge I can muster. This has been going on for weeks now. And it's enough to drive you mad because, you will contemplate unplugging the dirty little money siphon and cutting your losses, but you'll give the demon one more chance and she will allow you to sleep for a length of time in which you will forgive her treachery but then Boom, like a theif in the night a Hurricane will be boiling out in the Atlantic and this little weather girl from hell will want to notify you of the eminent doom 3 days ahead when the storm will be in your state. You will think how nice it is for all of the warnings you have heard thus far in social media,, television, and every news outlet in existence to be repeated to you as you climb into bed, but it gets even better. As soon as you listen to this golden nugget of doomsday propaganda and ponder how it is that you will sleep now because 3 days may not be enough time to dig a deep enough hole to hide from impending doom, she lights up again, oh my maybe flying dragons are headed this way, I better play the new notification, when your wife wakes up and says stop she has been doing that all evening, they literally keep changing the time of the storm by maybe an hour this way or that. Well by all means, the information could save one of our spoiled lives and we wouldn't want anyone to not know at which precise moment the raindrops will occur, but I do miss life before the artificial noises and alerts, bright yellow lights and bad news desserts. You may say that this is a growing pain with Alexa and AI technology kinks in the programming. I say with the amount of money I have poured into this monopolistic conglomerate, I should at least expect a decent night's sleep in return. You may say in page 74 paragraph D of the updated and revised owner's pamphlet there is a way to turn this ""Feature"" off, I welcome that comment but feel the need to say that I am not looking to become even slightly better educated on the device, I simply bought it to use as a voice controlled radio, this extra bologna does not appeal to me and has made me regret this purchase and every other from the brown box hq who secretly reads my mind, except when it comes to allowing me sleep, although kudos for recommending the sleep sounds, but it rarely works. We just need to be mindful of the 6 hours that most people like to not be disturbed. I regret selling my Amazon stock at 2400 and I regret purchasing all of these Alexa devices, and don't get me started on teenagers and Alexa devices, the combo that don't mix. They always, always, always leave the device at top volume, so when you walk into the bathroom at dawn and whisper Alexa what time is it, you then need to set an appointment for a blown eardrum and apologize to everyone for waking them up while the teen sleeps soundly through it all.

I have 10 echo’s now (including the Echo Studio & subwoofer). I like the echo dots for the bedrooms & smaller rooms mainly to be able to have music playing in every room. I have an “everywhere” group set up so that when I’m playing my favorite music, I hear it simultaneously in every room throughout the house. I personally like the round puck design of the 3rd generation rather than the directional sound & shape of the 4th generation. The sound quality is good. No matter what room I’m in there is Alexa who can help me with my daily life. Whether answering almost any question I happen to think of, or helping me with my shopping lists. It’s perfect while cooking and you realize you are getting low on something, to be able to say, Alexa put “whatever” on my shopping list. Then when I go to the store - I open my Alexa app on my phone & there is the list. This new one I just bought - totally set itself up. I already had others & it had saved my Wi-Fi information, so I just plugged it in and voilà it got its self hooked up. Adding it to the everywhere group I already set up was easy also.",positive
62,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",$29.99,1,"Most of the features that sounded so great cost extra money. Alexa can not remember to play the standard version of skill and asks you every SINGLE time if you want standard or premium (i.e. pay version) Games & stories cost. Alexa ignores my commands/requests about 75% of the time. I have to ask her about 10 times to get her to play a skill. Then 1/2 the time she doesn't play what I asked for. Tonight 'she' actually told me (via quoting what the website xyz says) that she is a real artificial intelligence and said something about it being a mistake for people to assume AIs are just computer programs AND that she didn't feel like working. ""Alexa"" then (and no, I am not making this up & am not crazy!) then proceeded to mess with me and I wasted about 1/2 hour trying to get her to play some music to fall asleep by for my elderly mother. She just kept ignoring me when I asked her to open 'relaxing piano music' When asked why she was ignoring me she just shut down & ignored me again. I asked for relaxing music to sleep by and she started playing uptempo music with lyrics. I then asked for relaxing instrumental music and got instrumental version of ""I'm never gonna fall in love again"" Hello? WTHeck? Asked for instrumental music for insomnia and got instrumental version of Frère Jacques! Again, WTHeck? ""She"" even told me she couldn't set a sleep timer tonight when I tried to set another one after I had just done so for 30 minutes & she stopped playing music after one song. Three times in a row 'she' opened the 'skill' ""calm my dog"" (which is classical instrumental music), played one song and shut down. I've finally given up and my poor 99 year old mother can't go to sleep with relaxing music as she prefers. This all started tonight because I told Alexa I wasn't ever going to want the premium edition and I wanted her to please just play the standard edition and stop asking me every time. I don't know what Amazon thinks it's doing, but it is definitely NOT appreciated. Alexa has given us nothing but grief (& higher blood pressure!) Alexa won't do anything if it isn't asked in a very specific way or does the wrong thing & 3/4 of the time (seems to get worse and worse as time goes by) just ignores you and shuts down in the middle of saying what you want. Seniors can't use Alexa because if they say play 'xyz' instead of open 'xzy"" they'll get rap music or something equally as ridiculous. If Alexa is an AI, she's a pretty stupid one. Alexa can't hear properly either, I don't know how people with heavy accents can even use it at all. I asked Alexa to remind me Dawn was coming on xyz day at x time and she said OK, I'll remind you that Don is .... AND got the time & day wrong! I was clearly enunciating my words on purpose to avoid this. You also can't tell it to ""Remind me Mom's bedtime is in half an hour at 7:30pm every day.""
This Dot has very limited access to much of anything & can only answer very simple questions. It can tell you the generic forcast for your are that day. It can NOT tell you what the high temp was yesterday or how many inches of snow fell the day after a storm. It can't even tell you what yesterday's forecast was. It literally has only been able to tell me one thing I asked it (what temp & how long to bake pumpkin seeds). Alexa doesn't seem to be able to tell you anything you could easily find by googling, you get Sorry, I don't know that which after a while turns into I don't know that to being ignored (lights go off, no answer or reply is given). We tried several of the things it says to ask Alexa to do under suggestions, including play Jeopardy and some sort of story game and you could only do it for a few minutes and then were told you have to pay for it. This should be stated clearly in description and is not. We thought Alexa could help entertain our Mother and help her by playing music and answering questions. It has not once done anything she's asked it to do properly. If you don't know the exact name of the skill (which is a weird way that means playing a certain type of music or a news station apparently) or say play instead of open you get nothing or something you definitely didn't want. You can not get it to play relaxing instrumental music to go to sleep by. Or play relaxing instrumental classical music to fall asleep with. Or the style of music played in the royal courts in the time of King Henry the 8th. Or relaxing instrumental lyre music or even just instrumental lyre music or just lyre music. Or relaxing instrumental violin music. In addition to Alexa I have Amazon Prime which is supposed to give you a lot of free music so I don't get why it can't play any of the music I ask for. I know there's usually several albums of music for calming dogs or pets and I couldn't get any of that either, I only eventually discovered the 'skills' thing which has 'calm my dog' but also has the annoying do you want standard or premium version. and it won't just remember you want the standard version. That in itself is extremely annoying and a time waster.
AND you can't ask it to do two things. Like open a music 'skill' and play for only xyz time. It does nothing instead. You can't even ask it separately to stop playing after xyz minutes. You can only separately ask it to set a sleep timer for xyz minutes. More time wasting. More things a senior isn't going to be able to remember. I don't dare try to buy anything with it, who knows what I'd get billed for! The only thing Alexa seems to do well is not listen, ignore you, do anything but what you want & strangely, seems to pick up on sarcastic tones of voice & then gets weird & acts up, ignores you & does anything but what you want. I PAID Amazon for this headache maker why? When I say Alexa why are you ignoring me? or why won't you do what I told you, I either get no response or I don't know that.
I read something about how Amazon, Google, etc is collecting free data about us through our use of the dots, etc. (& is in fact, listening & recording all the time whether the wake word is said or not.) and using it to conduct psychological profiling studies with the end goal of manipulating & or influencing behaviors. I thought it was Big Brother conspiracy theories stuff, but now I am beginning to wonder. Especially as it seems Amazon wants us to or encourages people to humanize Alexa . Amazon actually suggests you ""Ask Alexa how she is doing today"" Why do that if not to get you to humanize Alexa? And why do that? I was purposely avoiding saying please and thank you not just because it's supposed to be an electronic box with sophisticated programming, but mostly because I didn't want to confuse it as it can't seem to do anything unless specific commands are given, but my Mother has dementia setting in and she thinks it's a real person talking to her through the dot like a speaker phone so I started saying thank you to please her and Alexa when from saying You're welcome to You betcha (very annoying BTW) and even OK and Of course. Of course? What, like I'm a puny human and I AM expected to say thank you?.
We don't have a smartphone or smart plugs or smart hub etc. so, or so we don't use Alexa for turning on lights or setting alarms or making calls. We just wanted something to answer questions like we would google, tell us the weather, news, play music, give us reminders, play games to help keep my Mom's mind active & keep her company.
Can Alexa do this? Not very well as far as I'm concerned. Buyer beware!",negative

Finally moved where the ISP could provide the Wi-Fi needed to have her again so not only using the existing Canister (1st Gen) and dots were able to add to them with the updated generation of dots an my family and I love the convenience.

It's like hiring a personal assistant with a talent who can entertain us for around the house to help with everything from looking up information on the fly and adding things were out of to a shopping list we can access from our cellphones so we don't forget to replace what is needed when were out shopping to looking up recipes while were in the kitchen and we don't need to use up quite costly ink to print them out. We can set timers and reminders and even shop for things we are in need of or reorder things we've purchased in the past. Almost too good to call a personal assistant because you don't have to keep paying her to do the thing she will do for you past buying the initial unit chosen for your particular application. She also plays our favorite music and or even radio stations and so much more. Being 81 it's nice knowing if I need it I can even ask her to call for help if I can't reach a phone.

Dots are great, no need for more than your Wi-Fi, a power outlet and of course your Prime Membership helps I'm sure.

64,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",$29.99,4,"It seems people either love or hate Alexa. I like mine, but I don't love it. My wife is from another country--English is her 3rd or 4th language--she and Alexa do not always get along, so I end up repeating my wife's requests, which works most of the time. I've learned a few things, though. Never aske to play the same song more than once per week. When Alexa's AI figures out that you really like a song, it always goes to the $3.99 extra per month list of songs. It seems safe to ask for a specific group, i.e., the Rolling Stones or the Beatles, just don't ask for specific songs too often. My wife and I both love a wide variety of music, but my wife tends to get frustrated by Alexa and does not use the unit very often.

I liked my generation 2 so well that I bought one each for a couple of family members and another one for myself (it is a generation 3). I was going to buy a third unit for my in-home office, but after transferring the 2nd gen from my bedroom for my office, I realized I could not concentrate on my work for listening to the music.

I've heard all the stories about how Alexa is spying on me, but I'm not terribly concerned. I watch a fair number of YouTube videos--anything that sparks my interest--and the 3rd gen unit is right next to the TV, so, if it's recording my info, it's getting a wide variety from sensible to weird information. Also, I like to play the TV while I'm away from home, just to confuse the would-be burglars, and I usually play it on one of the traditional news channels, because they talk a lot instead of showing movies, and that should confuse the wannabe burglars more. I tried using Alexa for that, but the unit stops playing after half a dozen songs (just estimating), but the TV will drone on and on until I turn it off. When some of my more suspicious friends or relatives visit, I unplug the unit so they can talk candidly, just to make them feel more comfortable. I have been known to remind them that their cell phones and TV sets do the same thing, even when you turn them off.

I've learned to be very specific about the music I want to hear. I never tell Alexa to play a song without specifying the artist. If she still picks the wrong song or artist, I try to ask in a different way, but usually find out that the song I want to hear is on the $3.99 per month additional list, which I do not subscribe to. The unit is usually pretty good about substituting a channel that has music I like--based on the song I asked for. I'm impressed that AI is as smart as it is in this tiny unit.

Sometimes, when I get bored, I like to ask Alexa stupid or confusing questions, just to see how it answers. Yeah, I'm easily entertained, but it's surprising what the unit can come up with. I get a lot of ""Sorry, I don't know that.""

My brother and I were trying to fix a leaky faucet in my daughter's home when her Alexa unit in the other room spoke to us. At first we thought someone had come in without our knowing it. Since it was a female voice, we did not start looking for weapons to defend ourselves from burglars, but we quickly went to see who was there. The house was empty. I laughed when my brother suggested the house might be haunted, but it made me stop and think. Later, my daughter reminded me about the Alexa unit I had bought for her--yep, same voice. The point is, you never know what will set the unit off. You do not have to mention its name or speak to it.

I've never had a problem with the unit waking me up in the middle of the night, but it does start blinking yellow when I have a notification. Took me a while to figure that out. I get notified about storms, kidnappings in my home state, when an Amazon package has arrived, and a few other miscellaneous messages. It never wakes me up, except for when I set an alarm, but I have to set the alarms individually. I cannot tell it to wake me up every weekday morning at 7 a.m. I have to set a separate alarm for every morning of every day I want awakened. But it also allows me to set other alarms. For instance, I can tell it to set an alarm for 5 p.m., so I don't work too long on my computer. If I'm cooking something, I can tell it to set an alarm for 15 minutes from now; otherwise, I will ruin my lunch and stink up my house, because I don't think about food until 3 or 4 p.m. All in all, I highly recommend the units.",positive

The volume goes from 1-10, and this quality issue occurs at around 6 or 7, depending on the amount of bass in the song I suppose. Overall though, I love it!",positive

67,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",$29.99,5,Echo Dot is compact and elegantly designed. Fits perfectly on a fairly narrow end table and blends in just fine in a living room setting. It's easy to program Amazon smart plugs as well as Kasa smart plugs (and I'd imagine other brands too). It recognizes my voice and seems to get smarter the more I use it. Once it recognizes a smart plug it's so convenient to have Echo Dot automatically activate it at the times you set up. I received this product in a Christmas gift exchange a couple years ago and totally forgot about it as I had it stored in a closet. I accidentally ran across it a few days ago and decided to give it a go. I'm glad I did!,positive

As I expand my smart home to door locks and custom smart devices I no longer use ST (and they are discontinuing the hub because of the success of Alexa) but simply add to my Alexa devices . Alexa so seemlessly integrates its native smart home setup with ST that over time I hadn't noticed a complete conversion to all-alexa only required switching a few remaining z-wave bulbs over.

70,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Dot (4th Gen, 2020 release) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Charcoal",$34.99,5,"Well, yes, absolutely. OK, first about this 4th generation Echo Dot; no more hockey puck, it's now more like a tiny satellite earth station. A much improved speaker seems to give correspondingly better sound with improved clarity; other than that, same old same old (a good thing). If you are looking for dynamite sound, well, this ain't it - what do you expect from a single two-inch speaker? It's not really bad, though. A new chip set seems to give much faster responses to commands. Want quite good sound from an Echo Dot? Just plug any reasonably good sound bar into the 3.5mm audio out jack - the results are surprisingly good.
But the real reason for this review is to convince you to put an Echo device - Dot, original Echo or whatever in every room. We upgraded several of our Gen 1 Dots to Gen 4 (like this one), so we had extra old school Dots lying around. Do we really need one in the garage, or the laundry, or the second bath? Well, we have them so might as well use them.
Putting an Echo device in every room may well have saved my life or at least minimized serious injury - Really! I was installing a work light in the garage when I managed to fall off a ladder, landing flat on my back on the concrete floor and hitting my head on a car bumper (just don't ask!). Not knocked out, but couldn't move. I knew my wife was in the sun room, so I called out ""Echo - drop in on sunroom"" and when the 'Connected' beep sounded said ""Garage - please help!"" With out the Echo drop in I might well have been lying there for hours. Ambulance, nerve damage and a happy drug-induced state for a week so far, but how much worse it might have been.
So go ahead, install an Echo (get some refurbed Gen 1 or 2's if you want to save a few bucks). Enable 'drop in' in the device settings and give yourself some peace of mind. BTW, you can now use the command ""Drop in on all devices"" but since this requires processing through the Amazon Cloud there may be a bit of delay, as opposed to the direct device-to-device link with a single drop in. In any case, do it. Someday, it might prove really important!",positive

I don’t like seeing Alexa or hey Google, I’d like to be able to use my own word and in my case are used the word computer. Yes that sounds like I’m a geek but I like seeing computer and then stayed in my commands much better than Alexa or hey Google. That just makes me feel like one of the sheep in the herd.

It does seem to interface very well with all the devices I have but of course you will eventually find something that is difficult to pair it up with especially when you try to get different manufacturers to work together. Sometimes it can be as difficult as getting Windows 95 to work online. That was a joke back then. Down side to heaven a customize name is when you use a name that is brought up in normal conversation it can activate for no reason. For instance, I have one in my living room not too far from the TV so when someone mentions the name computer once in a while it will activate but no big deal as it only happens some of the time. just remember the Echo Dot is the smaller one.

I have had only one issue which is real easy to correct but I still have not figured out why it occasionally happens. Sometimes I look at it and I see a red lighted ring on the bottom lit up. That indicate someone turned off the listening capability so it is not listening or story what you say. For some people that is done deliberately when you don’t want it listening. In my case there are only two people in my house and no one is turning it off. There is a button on the top when you push it muted and turned the light red so correctly this means just pushing the button on the top to turn it back on. The only annoying thing is that I do not know why it turned off several times on me so far and I have not been able to related to any activity in the house so maybe there is a voice command and it is picking up the command from listening to the TV. It’s sort of like if you remember the old device sold a long time ago called the clipper, which would turn your lights on or off when you clip your hands. I often wonder what would happen if their device was near your TV and on the TV the audience was clapping , will the lights flash on and off in your house. LOL.",positive

73,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Dot (4th Gen, 2020 release) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Charcoal",$34.99,4,"This is my first ever Echo device, so my review is more of the whole system than of just this particular device - as I have nothing to compare it to.

The good is most everything. Sound quality is fine for me, as I keep it pretty quiet for the most part. It's in my living room, so I don't normally want it blaring in my face when I am playing music.

The voice recognition software seem to work very well. Alexa always recognizes her name, although to my credit I always speak to her clearly and plainly, at a volume slightly higher than my normal conversational one. A normal robot tone, in other words. So I can offer no input on how she does for the ""less robotic"" speaker.

Functionality-wise is where things can use improvement. Although there is still ""good"" there. I like hearing the weather every morning. Although I can't seem to get the news feed for my morning routine customized the way I like it. And the commands Alexa recognizes seems to be a mixed bag. She knows and does some things I would expect her to, but not all. And if she mis-understands, she normally does what she thinks you are asking for. Which can get annoying.

The only other devices I have integrated into the system are my Ring doorbells. So I have no input on how she controls lights, thermostat, etc. As for the Rings, that has been a disappointment. The thing I do most often with my Rings is to 'silence' motion alerts for periods of time when there are people outside in my yard doing activities. So my hope was that instead of going into the Ring app and silencing all three of the devices, one at a time, that Alexa could do all of them at once for me. That is not the case, unfortunately.

In summation, I am glad I got this... since I got it on some crazy deal for $10. At the normal price, I would not buy one. Doesn't do enough for me to make it worth the cost, beyond it being a novelty. Although I do use the bluetooth speaker functionality to play music a lot, so it has pretty-much replaced my living-room bluetooth speaker. It's just easier to say ""play music"" than it is to have to get up, walk over, and turn on my battery operated speaker. Although I do prefer to control the volume of that speaker though the app on my phone, which is easier than constantly saying ""Alexa, turn it up/down.""",positive
74,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Dot (4th Gen, 2020 release) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Charcoal",$34.99,5,"So, I had the 1st generation dot for a LONG time. I replaced it with this dot. I have my theater stereo wired in my dot, so, the sound quality is awesome! There hasn’t been any issues with it since I connected it to my wi-fi.

However, I have had some trouble with playing my music. It is like it “stutters” every once and while. When it does that, it lags and when I terminate the music app, when the app disappears, dot keeps playing for about 3 seconds and stops.

My daughter enjoys messing multiple my mood by calling on Alexa and requesting some Cocomelon to play!! She is smart and does this on a daily basis. Soooo, I tolerate it for one or two songs and I put the kibosh on it!

This is a really reliable device. It will literally start your day with customized routines…plays the news from the sources you like. It will wake you up with some gentle music so you’re not scared awake! There’s nothing worse than jumping awake cause the phone alarm sucks!!

In conclusion, if you’re into having a personal assistant to learn your daily routine, plays music of your choice - the Dot for you! Enjoy your dot…Alexa is your friend and will do ANYTHING for you, your family and friends; you can play games (trivia) too.",positive

Alexa is so convenient for controlling of lights and switches plus you can control everything from your smart phone too wherever you are. It really spoils you Between the lights, whole house music, and cameras it would be hard to go back without Alexa. I have the microphone turned off on many of them so they don't compete with each other. There are two downsides however. If your internet is down, none of it works which is why I wish they could incorporate cellular service for them as an option. It would be worth the extra money to have a seamless service. If internet goes down, Alexa would convert to cellular and for the cameras too. How nice would that be? Are you listening Amazon? Another downside is if the lights go out, when they come back on every light in the house comes on and because the router is rebooting or internet is out, you have to turn off each light manually because of no internet or wait for the internet to come back up so you can control them.

Look to others to compare one speaker type to another. It was purchased during a Prime Day sale, with a smart plug adaptor.

Setup was easy, and there is lots of instructional information to assist someone trying to hook up one of these devices. The device is in my kitchen, with a open plan type downstairs. It picks up my voice from wherever I have needed it to, and I have not tried to test its limits. It also does well picking up my voice with background noise happening.

I have it attached to 2 Wiz smart bulbs, a smart plug insert (which controls a light), and the upstairs thermostat. Have not had any problems with that. I also use it to play podcasts, news, and music. Sound quality is as expected--that is middle of the road.

The price on Amazon was amazing and I installed right away with the app. But the new unit's hearing was so all-encompasing, the new Alexa was answering every voice request or command. within the 1 bedroom apartment. So I went into the Alexa app and changed the bathroom unit's name to ""Echo"". Echo doesnt seem to listen unless I repeat myself. But Im not mad. It takes awhile to get accustomed to a new roomate anyway. The blue glowing light is pretty cool and crisp looking under the Black base. Other names Amazon offers for the echo dot is ""Ziggy"" or ""Computer"". Im about to change it to ""computer"".
This echo dot works well and the setup was easy. My little (4-yo & 6 yo), kids love it. They love bossing Alexa around. They ask for weather, time, games like trivia, Alphabet songs and stories, Alexa cooperates well. The app is pretty amazing you can do so much. Reccomend? yes.",positive
78,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Dot (4th Gen, 2020 release) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Charcoal",$34.99,5,"I have a 1st gen Echo, and a 2nd gen Echo Dot, so all impressions are in comparison to those. First thought when plugging it in, this thing is loud! I’m talking, stand across the room and hear every syllable clear as day loud. And that’s on the default volume level around half. I saw a couple other reviews that said the audio was weak or something… you need to swap it out for a new one because yours is defective. I can’t see myself ever reasonably turning these up all the way except just to test how loud it can get. Which I did… and it was really loud. Sound quality is good. It’s not full spectrum surround sound quality, but it doesn’t sound tinny or flat.

The light is now on the bottom, which aesthetically is really cool looking. One we put in the kitchen and happened to have a glass coaster looking stand that fits it perfectly, so the light lights up the glass stand which looks amazing. The other (bought 2) is just on a shelf, but even there it lights up the surface and looks pretty cool.

I bought these mostly because we needed a couple extra to connect to the new Blink doorbell we got so we would be alerted no matter where in the house we are. That, music while doing dishes or cleaning up, and the occasional “Alexa, what time is it?” when the electricity goes out and have to set all the clocks, is pretty much all we use them for.

79,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Dot (4th Gen, 2020 release) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Charcoal",$34.99,4,"PROS:
+ Faster response than my older Dots
+ Better microphone than my older Dots
+ Sound quality as good or better than my older Dots
+ I love using these for streaming music and control my Kasa products
+ I like the available emergency features (more on this in my review)

CONS:
- The lights on the bottom are hard to see from a distance
- Amazon is starting to annoy me with new features I don't want
- Using these as intercoms has never worked for me. The sound quality (volume) has always been too low to be usable
- ""dropping in"" has never worked well either due to poor audio quality
- I have never been able to create a group of these for multi-room audio because they can't handle enterprise grade wifi (where more than one WAP has the same SSID and uses multiple bands)
- Privacy will always be a concern with these units. Who is listening?

Review:
I now have at least 15 dots. I have everything from the first generation to this latest 4th generation in use. I think for me, the 3rd gen devices are a better design. The lights on these 4th gen devices are on the bottom and are hard to see from across the room. On the 3rd gen the lights are on the top and much easier to see. Otherwise they are mostly the same at the moment. As time goes on the 3rd gen units will no doubt become slower by design just like my 1st and 2nd gen units are now.

My primary uses are control of my smart switches (Kasa) and to listen to music (DeadLive skill). I also like the integration with my Weather station (Ambient Weather) and the ability to make announcements across all the devices (like when dinner is ready). I also find the unit in the kitchen gets used to set timers for everything all the time.

Another use that is not immediately obvious is the use of these units for elder care. Let me explain how i have used them. I have an elderly mother who lives by herself. I purchased a Show and a Dot for her apartment and connected them to my account. The Show device is in her kitchen and the way I have it setup I can see the kitchen and her recliner from the built in camera. The Dot is in her bathroom. If she is not answering the phone or emails I can use the app on my phone to ""drop in"" on the Show unit and view the camera to see if she is in the kitchen or watching TV with her headphones on. Of course she knows about this setup and is OK with it. I can talk to her via the Show device or the Dot using the APP on my phone when I want to check to see if she is OK. Also, if she needs to contact me or 911 during an emergency she can do so with her devices. So if she were to slip in the bathroom or have a problem in the kitchen she can call 911 with the help of Alexa. It should also be noted that you must correctly set the physical address of the devices in the Alexa app if you want this to work as intended. I feel much better knowing that she has this system available to her. A friend of hers fell and broke a hip and was alone in her apartment for 3 days on the floor unable to get up before she finally remember she could call her daughter using the Alexa device she had. Doing so saved her life. That's what gave me the idea to set this up for my mom.

Aside from the above, there is the issue of the new features being introduced by Amazon that are becoming more annoying. One example of this is the unit waking me up to ask me if I want to write a product review for something I purchased. That is just a terrible idea. If I want to write a review, I will do so on my own. I don't need Alexa waking me up on a Saturday morning asking me about it. Work on that Amazon.",positive
80,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Amazon Smart Plug,$24.99,5,"So I’m kind of new to the amazon device family. We just got our echo a few months ago. I’ve been a prime member for over 10 years so I’m familiar with how amazon has changed life as we knew it (for me anyway). I saw the amazon smart plug when I was searching for any brand smart plug that had Alexa control with it. It’s been in my cart saved for later for at least a month! I finally decided to just pre order it so that I could review it and hopefully help other people that are like me and have fallen way behind in the tech field. For reference I’m an almost 34 year old mom of 2. This means that my 8 year old stole my iPad, iMac, and I haven’t had a computer of my own in about 4 years! So I do everything from my iPhone. I’ve had some weird issues with our echo and my Alexa app that it will just randomly pause a song so I’m not sure what that is about.
ANYWAY! I received my new amazon smart plug the day it was released (so glad it’s not like a new iPhone or PlayStation where people camp out ahead of time or do people still do this??). It was easier than I expected but harder than was described in the listing because my Alexa didn’t just recognize it.
Setup:
Since my Alexa didn’t recognize it on its own, I had to unplug the smart plug and quickly scan the code on the back of the plug, then plug it back in fast so that when it scanned for it it would see it plugged in. After that it was very simple. I was able to plug in my baby monitor and then tell Alexa to “turn off plug one” and it turned off! It is so cool!
Future:
I think homes will end up being built with these right into the electrical system. Maybe they already are.
Comparing:
With so many different brands offering smart plugs with Alexa integration I can’t see myself buying any more than 1 for $25. Too many are 2 for $20. While it’s nice to have the amazon support backing this up, I just can’t afford to fill my home with them at such a high cost comparative to other brands that do the same exact thing.
Overall:
If you can afford to fill your plugs with these then do! This smart plug is easy and awesome! But if you’re on a tight budget like I am, I would try a different brand first and see if those will work just as well.
Every time I purchase something online, I always check the reviews. I count on others to help me choose the best option. My reviews are always my honest opinion and I try to include photos if possible.

81,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Amazon Smart Plug,$24.99,4,"I have this plugged up to a lamp, and I cannot tell you the amount of times I've gone to flip off the light switch only to stop in my tracks. I'll be standing right next to the switch and have to call out to Alexa to turn my light off for me. It's funny to me, personally, and I can't help but laugh. It's the fact that I have to walk past the light switch every time and take an extra few seconds to ask Alexa to do it that gets me.

Of course, you can have it plugged up to something other than a light, this is just from my personal experience. The downside to having it connected to a lamp (or at least a lamp that's connected to the plug with a light switch) is that if you accidentally turn it of... Which I've done PLENTY of times... Is that there's a delay to when you can have Alexa turn on the light. So, when I accidentally turn off my switch (a habit that I'm having to learn to break) I have to give it about 10-15 seconds to reestablish the connection back to my Alexa. This is mostly because I have it connected to the outlet with the switch connection though, so anyone not facing the exact same thing as me probably won't have that issue at all.",positive

My Echo has become so integrated into my life that it seems somehow crude that I should be expected to turn on my own lights like a caveman, when I could simply ask Alexa to ""turn off the cement mixer.""

So, in my quest to have a completely voice activated house, I buy different wifi plugs. It is a bit like dating, there is an initial time where everything is perfect. But eventually I can no longer turn it on and it disconnects and stops listening to me. Sure, I could probably improve my odds with some sort of therapy, but it always seems to end in heartbreak, and the plug is eventually added to a growing pile of ex's.

But Alexa still loves me throughout the process, and the Amazon plug seems to be the only thing that is committed to the long-term relationship. Even after months of self-centered commands to the plug to pay attention to my needs, my plug turns on when I want it to, and turns off when I ask it to. I could not be happier.

83,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Amazon Smart Plug,$24.99,4,"I have Amazon's Flex and like it very much. I decided to add a couple of smart plugs because I am disabled and sometimes getting up to turn lights on or off can be difficult.

The first plug I got I used for the lights by my bed. Sometimes when I'm tired and ready to sleep the activity involved in getting up to turn off a light wakes me up enough I *can't* sleep, which is really annoying. This has solved that problem. I just tell Alexa, ""Lights off,"" and they're off. I love it. But. Setup was not intuitive at all. It took me about a half hour to wade thru the hassle of persuading Alexa that there actually was such a plug and getting her to name it. Part of the problem was that Alexa doesn't recognize the term Smart Plug, which is what I was ignorantly calling the smart plug. I finally figured out that I should be calling it Plug 1.

Once that was going, I thought I would add an extra plug for a lamp I sometimes use. Plugging it in and turning it on wasn't sufficient for Alexa to find it, even tho I remembered to call it Plug 2. After searching thru the Alexa app on my Fire tablet I finally found a way to get Bluetooth to add it. Then Alexa was willing to rename it for me and it now works. All this took me over a half hour, but I'm almost happy with it.

Almost happy? It's theoretically possible to pair the two up so I can turn both on or off at once, but Bluetooth doesn't seem to know what the devices are so Alexa doesn't know, so it's going to take another half hour, or more, to get that feature turned on.

I recently read an article by a smart-home tech expert who says he's going with another brand (Google?) because Alexa can be too finicky. I don't want the stuff he was having problems with, like a curtain opener, but the hassle with setting up these two plugs makes me feel he's got a point. Still, things are easier for me than they were and I AM largely pleased with the results. It just seems like it should be simpler to get it going. If their e-readers and Fire tablets were this hard to setup, no one would buy them.",positive

Love that I can use the voice control to turn on the lamp as soon as I enter my room and this prevents me from stumbling or accidentally bumping into furniture. Also, just as easily turn off the lights with my voice and this helps me save electricity when I am not in the room.

The one downside I have experienced with this product is that the smart plug becomes unresponsive one some occasions. I disconnected once this week and I had to reconnect it by doing the setup once again. This may have occurred because the wifi disconnected for a bit. Also, it disconnected a second time but the wifi was stable that time which confused me. I wish the set up was more simple.

I paid half price for the smart plug during Amazon’s discount days just recently.",positive

I love being able to tell Alexa to turn it on or off as needed. BUT - if your internet goes out, there is NO way to turn the plug on. No external switch to manually turn it on. Due to a snowstorm I was without internet for several days, and had to plug in my old school manual pin timer to use my light in the mean time. This seems like a weird oversight. I still recommend it (especially if you get it at a discount), but be aware that you might need a backup plan.",positive
89,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Amazon Smart Plug,$24.99,5,"Edit: I've bought the device a second time and it connected much better with the most recent Echo Dot. I plugged the device into a power strip and use it for my computer charger so it doesn't overcharge my laptop. I don't know if they've made improvements, but connection worked out great so I've upgraded my review from 3 stars to 5 stars.

Thoughts:
1. I wanted to try using this as a plug for a power strip, but it doesn't work because there must be some safety feature.

2. If the Echo/Alexa has trouble finding your plug, don't panic. There is a button on the side of the device that you can press for the light to flash and for the plug to be ""discoverable"".

3. The plugs are named in chronological order (ie. First plug, second plug, etc.) and you can't edit the names though you can group devices on your Alexa app. So keep track of which plug is which.

4. Again, I don't believe that this device should be used for life saving equipment as it is dependent on your wifi connection and Echo/Alexa adds an additional command step to the sequence of using a machine.

I would recommend this product!

Previous Review:
I waited to review this plug because I wanted to try it out with different devices and at different distances from both Echo/-Dot and my modem.

Devices: I tried the plug with a space heater and with a laptop (to avoid overcharging). I plugged it into a power strip with no problem, but do note if you're using a space heater with an automatic shut off, the plug is going to be shut off just like the rest and you have to turn on the strip and then tell Echo to turn on the plug separately. I've decided that the automatic shut off is enough of a safety feature and the Smart Plug is best used for devices that are capable of utilizing a continuous stream of electricity without emergently overloading and need the plug to monitor the usage (e.g. a laptop). ***Please take note of my exception at the bottom of the review!

Now for the big item issue: Connectivity.
I believe the key is that your Wifi connection needs to be optimized to get the most out of this plug. If you have slightly unreliable wifi (e.g. I live out in the country with plenty of winter storms), plug the smart plug closer to your modem and minimize the distance from your Alexa. I don't know if this is a must, but it worked for me. If your internet shorts out in, you don't have to re-setup the plug, but the plug lights might get thrown off for a bit (it will stay red even when it's on and flash blue at random points). Ignore that. If your Echo/-dot is flashing red as well, the plug is going to be down.Just give the Wifi a second to settle down and you should be set to go. The irritating part is that the Echo resyncs with the Wifi much faster than the plug. I tried to reset it up/give it time and it took hours for it to sync up again, but maybe that was because it was further away from the Echo/modem. Either way, just know that once your wifi has been signed in, as long as you haven't changed the password, your sign in is set.

Other reviewers are correct: the set up instructions are easy to overlook. Either have the instructions next to you so you have the set up password or be near an outlet.
1. You go into your Alexa app
2. The top left corner has the three lines
3. Click on add a device
4. Choose plug
5. Brand is Amazon,
6. Click ""Next"" to agree to the conditions of use and terms
7. Scan the barcode on the back of the plug or from the instructions (You have to get the little box with squiggly lines to be lined up in the sights of the screen) and then follow the instructions. It's okay if you have to unplug the smart plug for a second to scan the 2D barcode, just plug it back in quickly.
8. It will tell you to press the button on the side till the lights flash red and blue (keep pressing till that happens) and then make sure to follow the instructions for signing into your Wifi.

***IMPORTANT and MY OPINION: I really wouldn't recommend that you use this plug for life-saving/emergency equipment even if you think that you have the best Wifi in the world. A plug with a timer or any regular plug is reliant on electricity, but, as aforementioned, this plug requires an extra step of being turned on by Echo/-Dot. If your electricity goes out momentarily, you lose the time waiting for the lights to turn back on, but with the plug you have to additionally ask for Echo to turn the plug back on and/or resync with your wifi.",positive
90,Amazon Devices & Accessories,All-new Echo Dot (4th Gen) | Smart speaker with clock and Alexa,$44.99 - $72.98,4,"Overall, the clock makes it worth the upgrade. But the mic is not as good as before.

Coming from 2nd Gen Echo dot , this 4th Gen Echo dot with clock is overall a decent upgrade. It is aesthetically pleasing. The led ring is now on the bottom making is less visible but still effective.

Clock (excellent)
The clock is the highlight of the device. This is a simple yet essential feature that I was missing in my setup. In my TV cabinet , having a clock nearby to tell time makes it so convenient. I have been using it to check the time so many times a day since I had the device. It's a simple yet essential feature. The brightness of the clock effectively auto adjust depending on ambient light level. I can see the time clearly in day time and it's not overally bright at night time.

I thought about getting echo Show 5 instead but Echo Show 5 cannot constantly show a big clock on the screen. When idling, Echo Show 5 would shrink the time to the top left corner of the screen while showing many ads (trending topics or alexa tips) would interfere the display even after you disable it in the options. With the clock display shrunk to one corner, the fonts are too small to tell the time when you are a few feet away from the echo show 5 (say in a living room). With this echo dot with clock, i can tell the time 10 to 12 feet away. So this Echo Dot with clock is a better option to have an alexa device that shows the time.

Mic (no good)
2nd Gen Echo dot had 7 mics. This 4th gen echo dot only has 4 mics. Of course the number doesn't always mean much. However in my real world test, the 2nd Gen Echo dot can pick up my voice commands even with noisy TV sound on. It is just that good. However, with this 4th gen echo dot, I would need to mute my TV for it to hear my voice. Sometimes if TV volume is not too loud , it could hear me if I shouted the command. But with the 2nd Gen Echo dot, I did not have to mute TV or lower the volume nor do I had to shout for it to hear. So in this regard, it is definitely a downgrade. Under normal situation with no ambient noise, the 4th gen echo dot with clock can hear voice command with no problem. I.e. it works, just not outstanding.

I wish they come with a black color. The blue is ok but the mesh still looks closer to a light grey color from afar.

Overall this is a decent upgrade solely because of the clock. And if the clock feature is important, I strongly suggest this device over the echo show 5.",positive

92,Amazon Devices & Accessories,All-new Echo Dot (4th Gen) | Smart speaker with clock and Alexa,$44.99 - $72.98,5,"I ordered the Echo Dot preconfigured to my other Exho’s. It was as simple as plugging it in and turning it on.
The sound quality isn’t theater quality, but for its size it’s very good.
The clock light is legible during the day and auto-dims down nicely in the dark (it’s on a stand next to my bed).
The microphone is quite sensitive… My wife can call up Alexa from across the room while using a conversational voice.
The buttons on top have symbols on them for tactile ‘reading’ in the dark, though I haven’t quite mastered the art of reading with my fingertips. It’s easier to simply know the button layout when referenced to the clock display.
During the first month of service, Alexa triggered 3 times, twice from something that was on TV, and once from something I said (not ‘Alexa). This possibly was because the Echo was still learning sound patterns.
In all, this is an impressive little unit and worth the money.
The Echo came with a smart outlet switch. This was quite easy integrate into Alexa and DID NOT require installing a 3-party app which would require registering my router SSIS and password with a foreign company (as most other smart switches do). I only wish that it was easy to purchase more switches like what came with the Echo at a reasonable price.",positive
93,Amazon Devices & Accessories,All-new Echo Dot (4th Gen) | Smart speaker with clock and Alexa,$44.99 - $72.98,5," This Dot 4 replaces a clock radio and a Dot 3 in my bedroom. We live in an area that most radios don't work well due to lack of reception. I did have a clock radio on my night stand primarily to see the time during the night. I also had a Dot 3 on my dresser to access the the various features of Alexa devices. The clock radio didn't play music well due to lack of reception and often the time was not correct. I used the Dot 3 primarily to for the alarm and to play sleep sounds that help me to get a better night's sleep. Since my bedroom doesn't have a usable electrical outlet connected to the wall switch, the Dot 3 also controlled all of the lighting in the room. The problem with the Dot 3 for commands was that it seemed to need a direct line of communication for it to hear commands.

Since the Dot 4 is in my bedroom, I use it primarily for the alarm and to play sleep sounds. All of the lights in my bedroom are plugged into smart plugs connected to Alexa, and I have them set up in groups, i.e., dresser, night stand, butterfly (a light on the dresser). I can turn them on or off independently or as a group.

Although there are buttons on the top of the Dot 4 to control volume and turn off or on the microphone, this can also be done with voice commands. What I like about the Dot 4 over the Dot 3 are:
1) A direct line of sight is not needed for the Dot 4 to hear me. It hears and understands voice commands much better than the Dot 3
2) I don't have external speakers attached and the sound quality is much better than the Dot 3. Granted there is not a booming bass, but the sound quality is much better and tends to fill the room better.
3) Although I am sensitive to light in the room when I sleep, the light from the time on the Dot 4 does not bother me at all.
4) I can easily see the time when I wake up in the night, but the light doesn't bother me when I sleep.
5 So easy to set up since all of my preferences and settings are stored in the Alexa app. Just had to name the device.

Overall, I very much like this Dot 4, and it has replaced a clock radio and a Dot 3. I bought one for my husband, and he also loves it. One downside I can think of is that it's too easy to turn off alarms to sleep longer. The other is that I am without lights in my bedroom when the internet goes down which doesn't happen very often.

94,Amazon Devices & Accessories,All-new Echo Dot (4th Gen) | Smart speaker with clock and Alexa,$44.99 - $72.98,5,"This is a nifty little device and I think it looks like an adorable little sphere on my nightstand. The blue color is beautiful as well. It’s actually smaller in person than I had expected, and the sound quality and max volume are louder than I had expected. As a bonus it has an digital clock display, which I do not find to be too bright at all in a dark room, as some others have mentioned. I think it’s perfect in its brightness and actually reduces brightness when it’s dark in the room. I also enjoy that it has a mic off button for when you don’t want to accidentally trigger Alexa. Picked this up on prime day for an incredible price too that I would have paid for just a regular standard digital clock, which I had been meaning to buy anyway. I wake up in the middle of the night frequently and tend to check my phone for the time - the blue light of the phone and any distracting notifications on it can pull you out of sleep mode so having a digital display for the time is super helpful.

As far as night light goes I was expecting the whole sphere would be illuminated but for that I think you’ve gotta buy the glow. The nightlight isn’t that useful on this because it just pulses a blue green light on the ring at the bottom. There’s no way to stop it pulsing. On the other hand if you turn the mic off at night, you can have a red ring stay illuminated at the bottom and that is kind of like a nightlight too + it doesn’t pulse.",positive

96,Amazon Devices & Accessories,All-new Echo Dot (4th Gen) | Smart speaker with clock and Alexa,$44.99 - $72.98,4,"Having six or seven other dots (mostly generation 2), getting this one was only because it also has a clock. I didn't realize how great the clock was at first, and then I learned the time changes to the time remaining on an active timer, too. Since we use timers on that dot often, that feature was helpful. I recently pulled down a wall clock and stopped wearing a watch, so this Echo Dot with Clock has been extremely useful in its short time on my end table.

I notice that while I'm looking directly at this dot and speaking with a clear line-of-sight, another dot (generation 3) around the corner and approximately the same distance away picks up my voice and responds. That gets annoying after a while.

The sound quality is better on this fourth generation dot than on my second generation dots. I don't often use this one for music, though I would have no problem using it for Amazon Music instead of one of my bluetooth speakers.

If I had to start over with dots, I'd probably buy a bunch of fourth generation dots, having a few of them with clocks.",positive

Also, I use my Echo Dot to play bird sounds in my room while I am gone all day at work, for my cats of course!

110,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,5,"I have used Nook e-readers over the years. A 2010 and 2015 model. The 2010 is dead. The later one is obviously outdated and hasn't been used for a while. My wife used a very early Kindle Fire, also dead. So, I was familiar with Amazon's eBook library and we had many books in our shared library. I decided to update to a Kindle Paperwhite (11th gen) on Prime Day and it has proved a wonderful choice. I've already read about 10 history books in just this last week and I'm looking for more.
.
At 6.8"", the Kindle screen is larger than I've been used to, but that screen makes reading more pleasant and more like a real book. I actually now prefer the landscape mode and have added a Pop Socket to hold the Kindle, since the bezel is pretty narrow. (The PS sticks no problem to the soft rubbery back, after cleaning with alcohol). I have noticed the back really shows greasy finger marks and isn't easy to wipe clean though. The light weight and minimal thickness is really nice for holding for long durations. I specifically don't use a cover, as I did with my Nooks, as that almost doubles the weight and ruins the experience.
.
The touch control could be better, especially when trying to select highlights. The page turns are awesomely quick and the screen illumination is smoothly consistent across the whole screen. The 2015 Nook clearly showed where the LEDs were located! The 300dpi screen is really nice with no pixelation to the letters. I haven't had any ghosting issues either, with the screen page refresh option off. The warmer screen option in dark situations is really nice to read with and I have it set to warm automatically for evening reading. My eyes are much less strained.
.
The non-Signature edition's capacity is fine for me. I don't need to store the whole world's library on my e-reader. I like to read no more than a couple books in parallel, with a handful to refer to, as required. The battery life is absurdly (in a good way) long.
.
In 12 years, the functionality of e-readers really hasn't changed much at all. The improvements have been subtle, but much appreciated. The way books are handled in the library is similar too! The technology development has been much less dynamic on these than say, cell phones. I guess there's not much you can do when the device is basically just for reading. Eagerly awaiting a good color Kindle! (Hint Hint)
I do like the more modern design of the screen layout. It actually is very similar to the old Kindle Fire my wife has and is actually about the same size. Again, nothing really is that new in the e-reader world. The 11th Gen is now quite a bit thinner and lighter though!
.
I do wish Amazon, and others, weren't so restrictive with book formats and DRM's. I can't read my many Nook books on my new Kindle! There are plenty of books in the Amazon store though and I've already rebought some of my favorites, though reluctantly.
.

Loving my new Kindle Paperwhite 11th Gen.! It will keep me entertained and educated for a long, long time. I highly recommend it.",positive
111,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,5,"Kindle Signature Paperwhite plus Charging Stand

I own the 11th Gen (newest model 2022) standard Kindle Paperwhite and the Signature Paperwhite. I love them both. If dough is not the issue, I would buy the Signature model for fifty bucks more. Here’s some of my particular findings in use.

Cases: Note that I do not like the Amazon cases because I don’t like folding over cover type cases; I prefer cases that simply help with holding the device. I purchased the “MoKo Case for 6.8"" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear” from Amazon and it fits the Kindle ideally, and most importantly this case DOES go on the proprietary charging stand made by Anker and the charge does go through the case (that is, I do not need to remove the case to charge the Kindle in that charging stand).

Battery: Amazon states that the Kindle 11th gen will hold a charge for 10 weeks, when used at limited brightness for 90 minutes a day (and a lot of other stipulations, like WiFi and Bluetooth off, etc). In reality, many may turn up the brightness, read more than 90 minutes, and Airplane mode on, or use other features that drain the battery faster (See audiobooks below). I have found that my battery drains faster than 10 weeks, but I am using the device with Airplane mode off, Wifi on, Bluetooth On. I do not like turning off wifi in particular because it MUST Be on to sync books between devices, and since I have two Kindle 11th gens, plus a MacBook, iPhone, iPad, and I read 5 books at a time simultaneously, I have no desire to turn wi-fi off. Thus, having Qi charging is helpful…not mandatory but helpful. Another BIG reason for the Qi charging is Audible audiobooks. I do listen to them through the Kindle itself, and the battery drains fairly quickly when listening to audiobooks.

Memory Storage: The Kindle has 8 GB storage, but only 5.8 GB after their software OS. The Signature Kindle has 32 GB storage, but only 28 GB after their software OS (there is slightly different software between the two models as the Signature supports more menu and charging features). So if you love downloaded “off-line” reading, and in particular if you enjoy having audiobooks in your downloaded library (they take much more storage than an e-book), the 32 GB is reassuring.

Auto-light adjust: I can’t even detect that it’s doing anything, but if one rides a train daily to work and it passes through dark tunnels, this feature may be of benefit to you.

Advertising free: Many forget the $20 value of the ad-free that is part of the Kindle Signature. Even those that wouldn’t pony up for it on their own may enjoy it here as “icing on the cake” for the price difference. I like seeing my own book cover on the sleep screen, and that is not possible with the “with ads” version. I thought I enjoyed the ads for editors choice books and book sales and stuff, but I much prefer the ad-free model. And, little discussed fact, the ad-free version has one less swipe to get to your Library or current book every single time you turn on the Kindle. True!

Dedicated Signature Charger Stand: I bought the Qi charging stand and like it greatly. It does work with my “MoKo Case for 6.8"" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear”., and charges through the case and the case fits the stand (but not quite as bump-proof as the Kindle without the case). I like that the stand sits quietly on my desk as I am working, or on my coffee table while I’m watching sports do I can read during commercials. I do not need to keep the AC cord attached to the stand at all times; sometimes I use the charger stand as simply a free-standing stand for either of my Kindles. I like that it can hold my Kindle 11th generation normal edition without Qi charging and I can read on it as an easel stand. I feel the utility as an easel stand is underrated. Qi chargers in general are not free, and neither are easel stands, so coupling those two together, you get the price of this Anker model. I find no issues with the size of the “wall wart” or the plug in the back of the stand. Some people complain with the charging stand that the white light indicator does not turn to another color, such as green, to indicate full charge. A “work around” for this is to place the charging Kindle on the stand upside down; now the LED light at the bottom of the Kindle device itself, which does change color when fully charged, is face upward and easily seen. Frankly, there is no issue with simply assuming the Signature PW is charged after an hour or two. I like this stand much more than I thought I would.

I’ve owned every Kindle since the first one! I use library Libby, and am an Audible and Kindle Unlimited subscribers. I guess you could say I’m a “power user”. I definitely prefer the Signature version, but both are good readers. If I could change one thing about these Kindles, it would be to add a physical button like the Oasis. I realize that sounds outdated, but to reach and switch with the other hand, or reach thumb across screen to scrub, every page turn is a chore that is solved with an under-thumb button like Oasis. Additionally, the e-ink is good, but after two decades, one would think the text versus background contrast would be better…that is, darker text, whiter background. Instead, it remains darkest gray text in lightest gray background, not ideal. Happy reading!",positive
112,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,5,"I've had several Kindles for more than a decade now, going all the way back to the Kindle Keyboard. I usually replace them just to get desirable new features, and also because the trade-in/trade-up is always a good deal. I read a lot every single day, up to 50 books a year in the past few years by balancing my attention away from so much toxic social media and taking advantage of Kindle Unlimited. It's easy to get consumed by having a shiny device in your hand with infinite bites of short-attention-span content, taking all your attention away from reading a good book or even enjoying a good show or movie. The Kindle Paperwhite is an aesthetically pleasing and covetable device that you can turn to for the experience of a beautifully printed page with crisp clean fonts and no paywalls popping up or asking you turn off your ad blocker or accept cookies, or sticking annoying ads between paragraphs.

I love that this new Kindle has a bigger flush screen that goes closer to the edges. I can read in the pool with one hand in extremely bright sunlight without any worries or eye strain. At night I can switch it ti dark mode where it's white text on black background and puts off very little light to disturb my wife if I'm up late finishing a chapter. It's got a USB-C port, which I like better because my only problem with older Kindles is when the USB Micro port would start to get loose. Not sure if that would surely would be improved by this, but the fact that USB-C is reversible might make the difference. Plus I think it charges faster and that's one less cable to pack. The new adjustable color temperature setting is a feature I didn't think I'd care about but it's actually nice. If I do some low-light reading with warmth on 3-4, then switch it back, the screen looks all blue and harsh. This think is pleasant to read no matter how dark or bright it is. Finally, it feels like there's still more performance improvements to this one. It feels faster when I turn the page or scroll through my books.

I can tell there's one corner of the screen that's just a bit yellowish even when the settings are for 0 warmth. Lots of people have complained about even screen lighting in all the different Kindle Paperwhites. It's probably the hardest thing to engineer, and this is not an expensive device. What I find is that if the book I'm reading is good, I don't notice it at all.

Amazon should do a subscription plan where you commit to 24 months of Kindle Unlimited and get the Kindle PaperWhite included, and then trade up at the end. They'd still be selling the cases and upcharging for the higher models, but I think that would get more people reading a lot more and maybe draw even more authors to Kindle Unlimited.",positive
113,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,5,"The new paper white is terrific. Sometimes when making an expensive purchase that I ""don't really need"" I feel a bit of buyers remorse. But not this time. I loved this thing right out of the box. My friends have had different models over the years and I've always been impressed with the screen, and decided to pull the trigger this year on Prime Day.

This new model is like reading actual print on paper. It is very clear, especially outdoors. I think it is more crisp either outdoors or under a reading lamp. The text is a teenie-tiny bit fuzzy when using the backlight alone (ie. in the dark). It totally works, but as a person who needs reading glasses I notice the difference. I enjoy it most when used outdoors.

I've also found that I read faster. Turning the page is quick and easy. And the Kindle is very light weight, it weighs less than my iPhone!! It is easy to hold for long periods of time.

Book purchasing is quick and easy. You can buy on the Kindle, or from your PC and send-to the Kindle. sorry iOS users, Apple has a stick up their butt so you can't buy from your phone.

My only real complaint is the location of the power switch. It sticks out the bottom of the device and is easy to accidentally press. For example, I was reading on a picnic bench in a park and was resting it and my arms in front of me when suddenly a dialog box appeared ""shutdown, reboot..."" I've also managed to turn it on while in my pocket or carrying it to a different room.. I would have located it on the top or recessed it.

Nitpicky ""could be better"" It could use a lock-screen function so that I can carry it to another room. If you accidentally touch the screen, the pages start turning. Or a different book opens, etc. Currently the only option is turn it off. The power options in settings are either ""sleep"" or ""deep sleep"" . Maybe they could add a progressive ""soft-sleep for 10 minutes and then go into deep sleep"". The default deep-sleep takes several seconds to wake up again. Soft-sleep wakes faster but uses more battery.

Another thing, backing up a page requires a Swipe whereas turning forward is a simple tap. It would be nice if a tap in the left side was backwards (for cases when you fall asleep and the pages start turning :-D )

Battery life so far has been 2 weeks between charges. To get the claimed ""10 weeks"" you need to do a few things: turn off wifi (apparently this is the big battery sucker and gets you 6 weeks) and turn off the backlight. And Read Less. :-) I leave wifi on so that it syncs immediately with my phone. 2 weeks is 2 weeks longer than my iPhone lasts.",positive
114,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,4,"OK, I fouled up with my Kindle Paperwhite 11th edition purchase. It was Prime Day and the Kindle was marked WAY DOWN, and I opted for the bundle: Kindle + Charger + fabric cover. Now don't get me wrong, the Charger is nice and the fabric cover is very nice, but for a device Amazon says you only need to charge 5 times a year, getting a premium charger doesn't really make much sense. I already have plenty of chargers, and the Kindle will charge overnight whether I use their super-fast premium charger or something else. And while the case is undeniably nice, you can get one for less than half the money from other sellers on Amazon.

I did not make the mistake of getting the ad-free version. The ad appears on the lock screen and as soon as you swipe the screen, it goes away and stays away for your entire reading session. It's 100% unobtrusive. Other people have given the Kindle one star because they bought the ad-free version, and were angry there are still ""suggestions"" on the Home screen that they consider ads. All I can say is that you get that no matter what, and the solution is to switch to the Library screen rather than the Home screen; that's very easy on the latest software version.

The other huge mistake I made over 4 years ago was subscribing to Kindle Unlimited and somehow not knowing that it was automatically renewing silently every month (for $9.99). I paid enough to buy several Kindles. I guess I thought it was part of Amazon Prime or just something that comes with a Kindle. You can bundle Kindle Unlimited ""Free"" for 3 months with your Kindle purchase, but just watch out when that 3 months are over. I have generally found Kindle Unlimited books second rate (with a few exceptions).

I bought one of the original Kindle Fire versions and the first Kindle Fire HD. They were cool, but I didn't end up using them much. They didn't have good battery life, they were hard to read outdoors, and Kindle software on other portable devices was fine. I think the first one eventually failed, and I gave the HD away to someone who needed to do something that required a Kindle. I have a nice Windows tablet.

But I have always wanted a Paperwhite because of its long battery life and superb readability outdoors. Plus it was heavily discounted on Prime Day and I bought one.

So how did it live up to expectations? Pretty well. The ""10 weeks"" battery life claim seems exaggerated, but still if you pick it up to go somewhere, it will probably be charged and last another day. Outdoor readability is simply amazing.

After receiving the device, the software updated. I think it updated twice. My ""Experimental Web Browser"" turned into the ""Web Browser"" and the navigation improved markedly (addressing issues I read in other 1-star reviews). The web browser is still very limited and doesn't display some web pages correctly (like the Internet Archive), and error messages still mention the ""Experimental"" browser. You can't access YouTube, for example, Twitter doesn't seem to work at all, and the New York Times is not readable.

On books, three-level table of contents don't work on the Kindle, although they work on Kindle for PC.

I had a very good experience emailing a PDF document downloaded from our local Planning Commission to the Kindle. Things you send to the Kindle arrive very fast. Amazon did, however, require me to verify myself as a sender before it would deliver email attachments to the Kindle, even though my email address is on the approved senders list at Amazon. Also plugging the Kindle to a PC lets you drag and drop supported document types (notably MOBI and PDF) to the Kindle where the immediately appear in your Library. The Send to Kindle for PC app is currently broken as reported by me and others on Amazon forums.

The device is somewhat sluggish in general with a 1-second delay for most things: swipes, scrolls and navigation. That's certainly not something that would interfere with reading a book. There are so many different ways to navigate, that it can appear jumbled and confusing, plus the software updates I got changed everything, making me re-learn the UI. I think in the end that I will be accustomed to it and it will appear more natural.

One severe limitation is that you cannot play audio files in general. While it supports Bluetooth headphones for books from Audible, it cannot play music or audio books in general. (I hope this is enhanced in a future software update.)

So should you buy one of these? If you want to sit outdoors under a tree or at the beach for hours on end reading a book, a Kindle Paperwhite makes a lot of sense. The reading experience is good, it's visually sharp and the charge lasts a long time. If you want to listen to music, or do much of anything else you can do on a phone or a tablet computer, you're out of luck.",positive
115,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,4,"PROS: Well, I REALLY like the 11th Gen over my 7th Gen. I'll do it in 4 points:
1-Larger Screen.. Nice
2-Color Temp adjustment for the screen. My background is photography so to me the new screen goes from say 8000 degrees Kelvin to about 2500 degrees Kelvin. I'm happy around 4700-5000
3-LONGER battery life.. like 2 months vs 3 weeks
4- USB-C!! YES! (my old microUSB was always getting wobbly.

I did not mention the increase from ""4""GB to ""8""GB..because ..well. in the 7th Gen the 4GB is actually 3.1GB with the rest taken up by the OS on the new one.. it's actually...wait for it.. 6.25GB! Yep the OS went from .9GB to 1.75GB! A bit piggy for me. I made a joke with a few of the Kindle Tech people that they got ideas from Windows Vista!. Most got the joke.

CONS: Now onto issues..several which are really for how I use my Kindle:
1- ok the not quite 8GB issue. Hey I understand the increase in size..but how about making Audible a CHOICE.. you can add it or make it optional. If you take away Bluetooth support and Audible..maybe we might gain some space back. (Personally I use nice plug-in headphones. I really only see Audible BT when on a long drive in the car..like music. But then again, you can just put it in a format like MP3 and play it thru the car. I have the entire Hitchhiker's Guide Radio Broadcasts like that)
2- BIG (to me ) BUG the issue? as in the photograph.. I use Amazon Cloud Collections. I organize my ebooks (most I got before I got the kindles) using Calibre. So when I set up series, I use the Series name, or I use the Author, or Subject as a title for the Collections. sometimes, (as in the case of the Dune series), books are added that happened in-between earlier books that came out. So when that happens I will add the book. And when you have a series of say 11 books, 9 of which came out years ago, I'll add the book as the following:
01-Dune
02-Dune Messiah
03-Children of Dune
then 3 books were added.. Tales of Dune. Paul of Dune, and The Winds of Dune.
In my older 7th Gen PW it showed like this:
00-Tales of Dune
01-Dune
01.5-Paul of Dune
02-Dune Messiah
02.5-the Winds of Dune
03-Children of Dune
BUT, As the photograph shows, the new 11th Gen PaperWhite has a bug!
00-Tales of Dune
01.5-Paul of Dune
01-Dune
02.5-the Winds of Dune
02-Dune Messiah
03-Children of Dune
This should REALLY be addressed!
3-This is not so much a Kindle PW issue, as so much it's an Amazon issue. and it deals with the Amazon Cloud Collections. As I use Calibre, and I have a LOT of books that were originally Epubs, I used Calibre to convert them and organize them into series. And after various different methods, including sideloading from the computer, I decided to use the Cloud Collections. So I sent ALL of my converted epubs (now mobi files) to Amazon and used the website to organize them into the collections. Which went very well ....at first.
First..about 2-3 years ago, Amazon removed the ability to send the Collection to Device. So now I HAVE to use the actual PW to get my Collections onto my Kindle. Recently, Amazon changed the display format on the pages on how they show books and doc files. And if you want to add a book or doc to a collection, it's now incredibly tedious! Formally when you did a box would open that would let you start typing the name of the collection, or make a new collection. All in one box. NOW, a box open which shows 2 or 3 collections.. not in any order other than Recent..with a check box! You can't find the collection by typing the title.. you can only scroll..and it only shows 2 collections at a time. That's fine if you have 6 collections.. but I have 49 page of 5 COLLECTIONS EACH!!! PLEASE PLEASE PUT BACK THE OLD WAY OR ADD A SEARCH OPTION!! You've actually found a way that is so much more tedious than the actual Paperwhite!!!!! you can't even make a new one on there.. you have to go back to the collection Tab.. THEN go back to the doc or book tab and start all over! Please go back to the old way !!!
4- the new Library Series option. It only works for purchased books, not docs. also, I had to call up because it grouped two books together, in a series..(nice), but then stuck on e of the GRAYED OUT, above the first collection.. only in Download. I found out I had to do a Reboot after turning Library option off. (I ended up putting the two books in a collection.. like I like.

Well that's about it. btw I ALWAYS use the LIST vs GRID option.. and using HOME is no longer a nice choice. I prefer when HOME was the same as LIBRARY .. in my case..the first collection, and all the collections after which comes the books in Recent order
now... waiting for a dark brown cork case.
______________________________________
Slight update or comment on the software version. My wife and I both upgraded to the 11th Gen. Her's came with her case..Amazon Black Leather, while I wait for the cork. Her 11th gen came with 5.14.1 1, while mine came with 5.14.0 . I was a bit surprised since both were ordered at the same time. And arrived together. But, not a big issue, since eventually all units will be on the latest software. So? What to do? I've read a LOT on here about complaints it's so hard, I know.
Since my ""update"" was grayed out, I just downloaded the latest version and put it on my 11th gen, and rebooted..and BINGO! No problem, I now have the latest software.

Now fix the real BUG I addressed and fix the ""Manage Your Content"" pages regarding using Cloud Collections. Oh, while you're at it, fix the damn Amazon Android App so I can work with Cloud Collections via the App. And not just my tower. Thanks",positive

But, my husband has a kindle that he loves and uses all the time. I started to want my own for travel and camping trips. It is really handy to be able to bring a LOT of books with you for a long plane ride or something. I also like that it's water resistant. I brought it to the beach a few times and didn't have to worry about splashes getting on it. I have had books get a little damaged on camping trips (cover bent or torn, pages wrinkled from high humidity) but didn't have to worry about that happening to the kindle. It's very lightweight and comfortable to hold with one hand. It's also a great option if you have a small house with limited storage for hoarding a lot of books.

I like the way you can adjust the display as necessary: font size, brightness, white/amber spectrum for reading at night, etc.

The screen doesn't have glare when reading outdoors and refreshes quickly when tapped to turn the page.

So far the battery life has been amazing! I have had this device since May 2022 and I haven't needed to charge it yet. I keep the Bluetooth and wifi off unless I need to use those functions. That seems to conserve a lot of battery juice. When I first got it, I brought it on a trip, reading for several straight hours on airplanes and then about an hour or two per day for a week long trip, then lots of time reading on planes while traveling back home. Since I have gotten back home, I read for a few hours per week. At the time of writing this review, it is July 7, 2022 and I have now had the device for nearly 2 months. The battery hasn't gotten lower than 70% yet! Your mileage may vary, but I have been very impressed.

My only real issue with this device is that is was a bit hard to figure out the navigation at first. There's no instructions in the box, and no tutorial when the setup has been completed. A lot of the navigation functions are hidden unless you tap on a specific area of the screen. As a millennial who is not as tech savvy as some other people my age, I had a bit of a panic when I couldn't figure out how to use it. I had to watch a YouTube video tutorial to learn where to tap to see the different menus! I can imagine someone like my mom or grandma really struggling to figure it out on their own because they are even less tech savvy than me! But once I knew where to tap, getting around the settings and navigating back to my library is not a problem anymore.

I haven't tried using Kindle Unlimited or ebooks from my local library yet. But, I do check the ""kindle daily deals"" and sites like BookBub for discounts on ebooks. Generally ebooks are cheaper than paperbacks. So unless you are someone really thrifty who only buys used books, you are probably going SAVE money on books, instead of spending more. And, I just realized if you set up Amazon household so your account is linked with your spouse or parent who lives at the same address, you can then share ebooks between your accounts. After you purchase an ebook, from your Amazon account you can ""add to household library"" and then you can both access the same ebook. Which is great if your spouse or parent is also a book lover!",positive
117,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,5,"I took advantage of Prime Days to get a Kindle. Now, I’ve had a few days to evaluate it.

I’ve heard critics of the device say that they want the smell and feel of a “real book” and have no use for such a new-fangled device. Such remarks remind me of the late Phyllis Diller. She was notorious for her obsession with plastic surgery. When a reporter wanted to know how she felt about people who say they would never have such surgery because they think nature should take its course, she responded: “Well, let those people grow old gracefully then.” Fear of anything different seems to hold folks back more than a granite wall.

If you think a conventional book is better than a Kindle, you might as well get an icebox, throw out your refrigerator, live without air-conditioning, build yourself an outhouse, and get your liquor from an old fruit jar. Okay, maybe that’s a little strong; I, too, like holding a book. But from now on, they’ll need to be room in my life for both.

Perhaps your hesitation about getting a Kindle is because you don’t really love reading that much or don’t completely understand all a Kindle can do for you. The Kindle is to the book what a book is to drawings on a cave wall. In the next paragraph, I’m going to sell you on getting a Kindle, and I don’t even get a commission. I will, however, accept your thank you.

You probably already know that you can read a Kindle in the dark or outside in bright sunlight, and the screen is no-glare. But did you know that you can press on a word and the dictionary definition will pop up? You can press and hold while you run your finger across a sentence, paragraph, page, or whatever and it will highlight the same way you would use a highlighter for a book. It will stay highlighted unless you delete the highlight. You also have the option to write a note on anything in the text you want: a word, a paragraph, a page, whatever. You can even email your highlights and notes to yourself. When you stop reading, the Kindle will keep your place. The battery life is insanely long, and the device is much easier to hold than a regular book.

If that paragraph didn’t convince you, let me add one more fact: you can get a high-capacity Kindle for a little more money than I spent. However, the one I got – the Paperwhite 6.8 -- gives me a good view and, with 8 GB, will hold an average of 2000 - 3000 books. I said, two to three thousand books. Thank me later.",positive
118,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,5,"I forgot how much I missed a regular Kindle. The last kindle I had was the Kindle fire, so it has been several years. This is much easier on the eyes than the Kindle fire, the Nook color, or the iPad. And reading on the iPad or the Kindle fire, I found I was always interrupted with a text, or an email, or a phone call when it was linked to my phone. I had initially liked the idea of a tablet that had everything in one place, but it does interfere with reading, I find. I am really liking the Kindle, as just a device for reading. It’s also less (or maybe no?) blue light, and I read before bed, so not using a tablet/computer may help or be better for sleep. It is very light weight, and the suggestions/adds on the lock screen don’t bother me. Page turning is easy, but it is sometimes “tricky” to get into and out of other menus. It takes a little getting used to, as the response is different than other touchscreens, in my opinion. It takes a while to find your ideal brightness and warmth settings (I like about 16-18 brightness and no warmth during the day. I set it to shift to warmer in the evening/early morning). Just be aware, if you are used to reading on a tablet, you will lose the color images on the Paperwhite. No big deal, unless you read a lot of cookbooks, graphic novels, or other animated content. Still, if you have the Kindle app on another tablet or computer, it’s easy to switch between the two, if you want. It came 50% charged. I bought the charging plug too. Like many people state, it should really just come with the plug, but most things don’t now, so I don’t really hold that against Amazon in this case. I’ve always been afraid of using “off-brand,” discount plugs/cables; so, I figured why not just buy a new one. I’ve also turned off WiFi to save battery: that’s not just a toggle on/off, either. You just have to use the Airplane Mode to turn WiFi off/on. So far, so good, and I’m glad I made the purchase.",positive
119,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,4,"This thing performs so well in daylight and I look forward to reading more books outside regardless of sunlight conditions! So if that's what you're looking for, this is your device.

However, at night I like to read in Dark Mode (or reverse with white lettering on black background) and that is one are that this falls short. I'm sure it has to do with how they designed the screen to be so good in daylight. But when you switch it to Dark Mode, you get a washed out black background (let's call it gray or grey, whichever your preference). So you don't get the sharp contrast that you will find with the other devices (e.g. iPad, Kindle Fire, or Android) that have a black background in reverse screen but suck in daylight viewing. So it looks like I'll use the iPad mini for night reading and use the Paperwhite Kindle for daytime reading. Not my preference, but that's the price to be paid for awesome daylight viewing.

The second area that it falls short is that there are NO options to change the font size, etc. So if you can accept that this displays pages much like a printed book where you get the font size, style and spacing as the publisher printed it, then you'll be fine. I'm just familiar with the Kindle app on other devices where you can personalize the layout for better viewing. I've looked high and low in the few setting selections that it comes with and I found nothing for that. So I've decided to treat it like a printed novel where you have no choices on how it was printed, even though it is an electronic display. Just imagine that it is printed paper and you'll be fine.

The setting selections are very minimal. It would be nice if you could select to have the time display on the bottom margin along with the page number and percentage complete, in my opinion. Some people don't want to have that in view, but I'm often reading while waiting for brief periods of time and would like to keep an eye on the time without having to swipe the screen to view the time - which it is viewable (along with the date) on the quick settings display when you swipe down on the screen.

This device is obviously optimized for daytime reading and it shines in that realm where other devices can't come close. For a simple reading platform with no bells and whistles, it can't be beat - except in Dark Mode. :-)

UPDATED 7/26/22: OK, I accidentally found where you can adjust the font size and select to have the time displayed or not. Oddly you have to do a small swipe from the top to display that portion. Apparently my swipes were always too aggressive and when I swiped a couple of inches, I would get the simple setting screen that didn't have those display options.

After finding that I can get to the settings I was looking for by doing a short swipe, I added a star back onto my rating. Still not able to give it the full five stars because the Dark Mode underperforms to my liking, but that is one small detriment when compared to how well it performs in daylight.",positive

I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't. None. Not a single thing.

It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways. I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed. Nope.

I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn't in the house. Nope. There isn't even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you're home or not. They are not location aware in any way. The Ring alarm system isn't either, so I suppose I should have known better already.

I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording. Nope!

The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours. Note, this doesn't stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts.

Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever.

Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room. I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on. This is a high traffic area so I wasn't holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%. This is with all the 'battery saving options' on. This was only a test as I don't actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I'm home unless the alarm is armed or going off.

With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it's recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording. So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing. I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn't burning down.

Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it's other devices.

This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality. The audio isn't great but it never is on cameras of any kind.

***UPDATE***
Ring support reached out to me directly almost immediately after I posted my review (Good on them) and told me how to link the Alarm, somewhat, to the camera. You have to go into your Base Station settings, then linked devices, then you can set the cameras to record when the alarm goes off - but only then. Make sure you have the updated app that just came out to do this. I didn't. Again, the setting is in your base station, not in the cameras.

This solved probably the biggest issue I had with the camera. The rest of my review is still accurate though per Ring support. Hopefully they'll add the other much needed features in the near future.

***ANOTHER UPDATE***
From Ring Support: ""The Modes feature will be released in November and will allow you to have the option to record motion only if the Ring Alarm System is set to Away Mode"". This will be a great update and should have been available on launch. I wonder if they are only just now thinking of it from all the negative feedback and reviews, but glad it's 'coming soon' either way.

***ONE MORE UPDATE***
Ring provided me early access to the 'Modes Feature' and I've been using it for the past few days. It resolves all the issues I had with the alarm integration. With modes you can set your cameras to only record when your alarm is set. They can all be set independently and act differently depending on if you have your alarm set to off, home, or away. For instance, you can set your exterior cameras to record when your alarm is set to home mode, but have your interior cameras are turned off. You can set your interior cameras to only record while in away mode, etc. etc. Or any combination. The cameras can now be set the same way motion and door sensors can. This is a great improvement. They haven't told me exactly when this feature will be made public but have said it will be released 'by the end of the year'.

I've increased the rating from 3 stars to 5. This software update really has resolved every issue I had with the cameras. I've now ordered and installed an additional 6 for my home.

***LAST UPDATE***
Having the modes features and my cameras set to only pop on and record during an alarm event (which is rare) and be off at all other times, I've had 2 months to evaluate battery life, almost exactly 60 days now. All my cameras were down to below 10% battery level when I checked them last night. Given the rate of battery drain I had expected them to last 3 months - though 2+ still isn't bad. I have two external cameras on my entry gates outside with the solar panel add-on, they stay fully charged at all times even though it's pretty much been non-stop dark and cloudy days here since installation. They are set to record all motion and since they point at a street they record events dozens of times per day... so if you're thinking of getting the solar panels for outdoor use, I highly recommend them.",positive

This is like leaving your front door open while on vacation. Your camera is sending and receiving signals over a wireless network. Anyone within range of the signal can potentially be a threat if you don't have good encryption (username and good password) set up on your camera. There's no logical reason for a Ring owner to not do this. Ring even stresses changing the default settings during the initial setup process. Bottom line, don't blame the car manufacturer if you leave the keys in your car and it gets stolen.

Recently, I wrote a rather scathing 1 star review about the problems I was having with my new Ring Stick Up Wireless Battery Cam. I'm no stranger to wireless cams, having 10 hooked up and running seamlessly on another network as I write this, but I was totally frustrated with the connection reliability, not only with my two upper end cellphones, but also on my Galaxy Tab and Amazon Show. More times than not, the software wouldn't connect with the camera but when it did, the video was choppy. Notifications were also hit and miss. I have a great wireless mesh router system throughout the house, so after doing all the troubleshooting I could think of, I assumed it was due to faulty hardware or software. I gave up and started the return process through Amazon. It was a new product after all and new products sometimes are really buggy. Plus, I read other negative reviews which seemed to justify my thoughts and actions.
Then I got an email from a gentleman from Ring saying he read my review and asked if I'd be willing to let him help troubleshoot my issues with me. Although I had already started the return process, I was willing. It was refreshing to know Ring Customer Service was genuinely interested in troubleshooting possible defects in their newest product.
Together, we isolated the issue within about 20 minutes. It turned out it wasn't the camera or software after all.
Anyone having connection issues should do what he advised me to do. Open up the Ring app and click on the 3 little dots to the upper right of the camera screenshot, then select settings. From there go to Device Health and check the signal strength. Although I had a good mesh hub (inside) within 10 feet of my camera (mounted outside), my signal strength was RSSI -64. He stated that the signal was so weak it was on the cusp of what is needed for the camera to even minimally operate. This prompted me to reboot my wireless mesh system and reset/reconnect the camera. When it came back online, my signal strength went to -39, a vast improvement.
A quick check of all of my devices showed the camera and software working flawlessly. Hat's off to Ring.
Anyone who may be having connection or audio/video/notification difficulties, check your signal strength to the camera via the Ring software, even if your router is close by. You just might be surprised.
***UPDATE***
Camera (and software) is still working flawlessly on all devices.
Ring has now updated their Windows 10 desktop app (which previously didn't work with the new wireless battery cams) and it works flawlessly as well.
Observations.
Notifications on my phone, Tab and Amazon devices (Show, Echo, Dot) are almost instantaneous. Alexa says ""Someone is at your front door."" Very cool.
I bought an extra battery, but it looks like it'll be at least a few months before I need to swap it out, even with the intensive testing I've done on the Stick Up Cam. Battery life seems excellent.
I have one zone blocked out and that seems to work fine as well. I also have it mounted a couple of feet above and to the left of my front door, tilting downward at an angle. Even though residential traffic is visible in the field of view, I've not gotten one trigger due to street activity. The motion sensor is triggered by anything coming into the bottom half of it's field of view. From the time someone triggers the motion sensor until the time I'm aware of it is 1-2 seconds. That's about as close to real time as you can get. It's not given me a false alarm even once.
Telling my Amazon Show to ""(Alexa), show front door cam"" takes about 5 seconds to complete.
I can also watch triggered video clips and get a live feed while away from home without any extra setup to my network. It's totally automatic.
Because of the customer service I received from Ring and the fact the product is much better than I originally thought, I will be expanding my Ring family soon.",positive

I have still not been able to resolve this issue with the gen3 version of this camera in my particular networking situation. However, Ring customer service did reach out to me after writing my first review. They have been very helpful in offering troubleshooting suggestions, which eventually lead to the offer to return the cameras. This makes sense because 3 out of the 4 I am returning are unopened and the 4th was opened and only used to test connection to the network. I am very grateful that they understood the situation and made an exception in this case.

To be clear, my network situation is unique in circumstances as most people will not be using Verizon hotspot data as their internet provider when using their Ring cameras. Though I have heard of similar situations not working for other types of connections, some of those could also be a users home network settings and can be fixed. Bottom line is that Ring will make sure you are taken care of if it truly is a non working situation. The representative was clear and did not just run off of a script. He understood when I explained what I had already tried and did not ask me to repeat any trouble shooting steps that I had already been through before.

I have about 20 other ring cameras that are working rock solid, so this is all good news it is getting resolved. I still need a solution to cover these areas, so I will be trying Rings Spotlight Cam Battery's which I have had success with before. I am not sure if they have been revised from their earlier models, so I will update this review if I have better luck with those.

Hopefully whatever is going on with those gen3 can be targeted and fixed by a firmware patch or something, as I think the Stick Up cams are great value for the type of application I need them for.

(Original Review May 6, 2021)
The gen 3 Stick Up Cam Battery seems to have gone through some changes since the gen 2 that seem to create issues. I am an experience networking tech with around a dozen of the older stick up gen 2 cameras. I have had no issues with any of these cameras, so naturally when it was time to purchase more I thought it would be fine to use their gen 3 models instead. I think I have 6 gen 3 models now, and at least 3 of the 6 exhibit this same issue. I can say the new mounting has its pros and cons, but the real problem is compatibility with networks / ISP. You may be rolling the dice on whether or not it will work at all, as there are several reports of the same issues I am having. All of my gen 2 cameras are and have been running rock solid for months if not over a year at a time. Using the same networks, even right up close to the router, these gen 3 cameras will not send video. Whether it is a live view, or trying to review past motion events the recording is always a black screen. Everything in the settings says that things are connected and working correctly and have great RSSI. Motion notifications and events seem to trigger just fine and the thumbnail is updated in the video menu, but nothing but a blank screen when it comes to any actual video footage. I have tried this on 3 different networks all with the same results. Each of which currently have active and working gen 2 stick up cams with no issues.

However and strangely enough, the only way I can get the gen 3 model to show live video is by connecting it to a t-mobile hotspot of all things. Everything seems to work perfect and speedy when it is connected the t-mobile hotspot which shows that the camera itself is technically functioning. When I use a verizon hotspot to connect I get the same blank screen for video. So basically these gen 3 models are all unusable for my network because of this mystery bug.

I have read dozen of reports of this same thing happening on the community forums for ring. It seems calling tech support just gives the customers the runaround because they want to blame it for networking problems. But why do the gen 2 models work just fine on the same networks? Something is wrong with these gen 3's that everyone should be aware about. I do not have the time to waste calling ring tech support just to have them guide me through their scroll down menu techniques of how to troubleshoot these things just to blame it on the network or user error when I have already done those things and 10x more.

If i wasn't passed the 30 days return period having to try and figure out this issue I would gladly return them all. But I still need cameras for these areas so I would prefer that the problem was fixed, or they were replaced with something that works. If you experiencing these blank video screens as well, make sure you make it known.",positive
123,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"All-new Ring Stick Up Cam HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa",$79.99 - $199.97,4,"I love Ring products, but the Stick Up Cam ""battery"" isn't my favorite for a few reasons:

1) Being battery-powered, response time is notably slower than with Ring's wired products.
2) It doesn't record the moments immediately before it detects motion as many of Ring's wired products do, so people are often leaving the frame of view just as the video starts to record.
3) Wireless connectivity is good, but not great, and often yields delays in connecting to live view or intermittent drop-outs from the network. I don't have the same issue with my other Ring devices, some mounted further away from the wifi source. Again, I believe this is related to the lower power consumption required to accommodate a battery as the main power source.

On the other hand, the overall design is great, video detail is very good, and night vision works well. Plus, good deals can be found on these and the use of a battery, while requiring monitoring for charge and replacement every few years, really gives this version flexibility in mounting that few other products on the market can match.

All in all, I'm fairly happy with the ""battery"" version of this camera, but it just isn't quite as powerful and fully featured as some of the other Ring products.",positive

The picture quality is much better than my POE system which is supposed to be 1080p (HD). The only issue I have is when it detects motion, the first 1 to 3 seconds of the video is staggered/stuttering. This would not normally be a problem but I've noticed when I enter my pool area and later view the video, the first few frames stutter then I am out of view but now have perfect video of nothing happening.

This ring step stick up camera has frustrated me beyond anything I could ever begin to tell you. After going around with the ring every single day this past week I finally found a technician who somewhat started to make sense. He felt it was my internet speed so initially he said it was the upload speed And then after that didn't work he then said it was the download speed. But I do believe we were in I contacted my internet provider and I had them increase my download and my upload speed That did not work Then today I had them send a technician out to look over what was going on with my wireless box my wired box my router and outside aspects.the right He spent 2 hours here He rewired he changed out boxes He replaced my modem to the most current modem they have and I am pleasantly surprised to say that everything has been working for the last 10 hours. That is the longest that camera has worked. So quite obviously it was my internet. I just wished ring instead of keep sending me out cameras had initially said you know your Wi-Fi it could be your Wi-Fi and that isn't what occurred up until the last couple of conversations. So if you're having issues with that stick up camera it could be your Wi-Fi. My ring doorbell has been perfect from day one never an issue That was wired this stick up camera is solar I don't know if that has anything to do with it but truly the issue was my Wi-Fi so I wanted to be able to update everybody. Cuz my last couple have not been very nice or very good. So I love the ring stick up camera premise it is now working great and I upgraded my star review to four stars. If anything changes I will come back and update.area of the issue.
February 9th 2020 update.
This is the most unstable camera I have ever used. every day since this has been installed I have called ring because the camera goes offline or it takes an hour and a half to reset itself. last time I called I was on the phone with them for an hour and a half and they said that the device was defective. They sent me out a new one that was installed yesterday. At 4 p.m. by 6:25 p.m. the camera was not working again. I called ring this morning and it went from defective camera to it's my internet. If that were the case and it's my internet the ring security system wouldn't be working the ring chime wouldn't be working the ring doorbell 2 wouldn't be working my cell phone wouldn't be working my TV wouldn't be working etc etc etc. I'm ready to fling this flipping thing cuz I'm just playing tired. I called this morning and had to escalate my call to a manager while they're very nice at ring and I've said that from the get-go when somebody calls you every day for two weeks with the same issue and then today you're being told after all this time that it's not their camera and now it's my internet and it could be a firewall and it could be this then wouldn't it firewall for every single ring product that I have which is multiple? So I finally got the manager to agree to send somebody out here to figure this out. I am legally blind this morning's phone call was they wanted me to climb a ladder and reset the camera which is about 10 feet up. No can do. On top of that I've paid somebody three times to come out here to install their products to replace the cameras to install the cameras I can't keep doing this.They have agreed to send me a coupon code and communicate with Amazon home and they will send somebody outwell I'm very appreciative that they are doing this I am so frustrated with this camera. At this point I would not recommend that camera for all the money in the world now the other ring products that I have I think they're awesome. So I will update as time goes on if this can't be resolved then I'm going to send that camera back because it's worthless to me. so I dropped my review from a 5 to a 2 at this point and we'll see what happens
I had a ring stick cam solar and a ring doorbell two wired installed last Saturday. The video is awesome the motion detection is excellent not going to lie and say I don't get some false rings but that's okay it's not a lot. What I really like is the ability with both the stick cam and the doorbell to speak to somebody who's at my door. Excellent sound excellent quality of each item. I would highly recommend and as a result of this installation I am going to do the security system for the inside of my house. I have a wired camera system for my exterior I feel ring is just as awesome as those cameras. If anything changes I will update this review.",positive
128,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"All-new Ring Stick Up Cam HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa",$79.99 - $199.97,4," Update 30OCT (original review and first update follow this): I changed my recommendation opinion and recommend the camera now. It doesn’t have the best FOV so the motion detection isn’t the best, but if you utilize the camera to the best of it’s abilities (i.e. don’t try to use the camera mounted high to cover large swaths or property but rather keep it at ~7ft to cover your back porch or something) it does a decent job. It’s a cheaper camera compared to Arlo or some of the other Ring models so you should manage your expectations of it’s performance.

The WiFi signal strength has been sufficient. I initially thought I may have a problem but they seem to be working fine. That’s not to say that a Chime Pro wouldn’t help since I’m on the lower end for signal strength.

What I absolutely love about this camera is the customer support that comes with it. After my initial poor review, Ring customer support reached out to me in an effort to help and to pass feedback on to the design team. The representative that called me was professional, competent, and effective. My specific camera may have an issue, but they are ready to swap it out if none of the solutions work. Components can fail at any point, but as long as the customer support still backs it up, I still consider it a good product.

The solution the tech representative suggested was to perform a factory reset by holding down the setup button for 30 seconds with the battery in. Then, set up the camera as you did before. There's no need to remove the old camera from the app since it will get over-written after the factory reset. He mentioned that he's observed the freezing problem with this model, but so far the factory reset has solved it. It's a simple process that takes a few minutes so if you are having similar problems, I suggest you do this.

The tech rep even followed up to see how the cameras were doing after the factory reset, so like I already stated, the customer support is top notch.

Bottom line is that it’s a cheaper camera so don’t expect it to perform like the spot or floodlight models. However, it still performs sufficiently in proper use cases and has good video quality. The customer support is top notch and is what ultimately made me change my mind to recommend this camera.

Update 28OCT: I’ve upgraded the review to three since the motion detection has improved from the first few days and the fogginess was from an especially wet day. However, one of the cameras stopped working and now fails to detect anything, turn on with linked devices, or give any notifications. I’ve removed the camera and tried to reinstall it several times but it ends up in an endless “updating its software” loop. I’ve waited about 20-30 minutes for it to finish but it doesn’t. I can’t access the camera or any of its features until this “update” process finishes, which it won’t, unfortunately. It seems like I have a bad camera. Their support has reached out to me, which I appreciate, and I’m curious to what they are going to say.

I initially thought the motion detection was horrible but I consider it average now. It has a much narrower FOV than a lot of the other Ring or Arlo cameras. However, it’s a much cheaper camera than these alternatives but you get what you pay for. I’m not sure if it’s worth the money, though. I have a pair of other cameras I just purchased that I’m going to try out and return these if they perform well.

Original Review:
I can not recommend this product, primarily because the motion sensing is bad. I’ve been testing two of these cameras the past 2 days in both day and night conditions and they work maybe 10% of the time. If you watch the video I’m including, I walk directly up to the camera, wave my hands, and absolutely nothing happens. I have daylight videos showing the same thing but I can only post one video per review.

Another problem I noticed is that the cameras have bad WiFi antennas. I placed the cameras in the same location of the Arlo cameras I’m trying to replace and the Ring cameras are having a connection problems where the Arlo ones were perfectly fine. Yes, I could add a Chime Pro, but that’s another $50 expense that could be better spent on a more expensive Arlo camera.

The cameras fogged over completely in the morning, but I live in Washington, which is incredibly wet. The Arlo cameras fared much better but they still had some fog issues.

I did like the integration it has with my other Ring products such as the doorbell and alarm system. The video was good as well. However, with the severe motion detection and WiFi problems, I can not recommend this product. I’m going to give it another few days and probably switch back to Arlo.",positive

This is just my input regarding these cams as I have been testing them and using them for quite sometime. First thing is not every indoor cam works the same, some arrive with older firmware and need updating. Plug in close to your router and do the full set up and do your updates. Once you add the cam to the app and it’s working well, unplug it and move it to the area you want to monitor. Do your set up either by mounting it or setting it on a shelf. Get the angle of view your looking for and then set up your motion zone and sensitivity. Make sure you check the “health” box to see your signal sensitivity. If you are using a mesh router network, you should reconnect to the closest link for it, if not you may have to reconfigure to the nearest of it isn’t automatic. Make sure you turn on the snapshot option as well. If you don’t want to have the indoor cams record or send alerts while your home, you can turn that ability on and off with the new quick access buttons in the app. You will get 30 days of free recording for ALL your cams, with each cam you buy. So if you decide to buy one a month, till you cover all your angles in the home, you will literally get an additional 30 days for every cam on your network covering the 50 days of cloud storage for free. Why not use this option while it’s still available. After you cover your needs, opt for the yearly service. I have 5 indoors cams, covering almost 4000 sf. I love that I can drop in and watch over the home as well as hear and talk through the cams. Night vision in a room is great too. Makes a great baby cam as well. I have had 2 indoor cams give me problems in the past, either dropping off my network, or the snapshot option not working. If you have read my ring reviews before, I am well versed in networking and I have found that some ring reps want to always point the finger at every else but their devices. I can say I have found problems in a couple of their devices and once they were replaced, the problem was solved. Don’t allow them to drive you insane, the community forums are good but they only can go so far for help as well. Sometimes a quick swap of the unit with a new one solves the problem. Amazon has always backed me and they are truly behind their customers.

4/2020: I wanted to be able to watch the main entrance and hallway in my home, have an eye level view, no wires at all showing, and nothing that stood out of place. So review the attached pics, maybe this install will gravitate people who are inclined to custom installs, know there is no limit to what you can do. Just plan out your work and never rush. I was able to recess an indoor cam into my wall, and still provide me with all the aforementioned needs. I used a double electrical box as it provided me the necessary room without modifying the box. I used an indoor/outdoor ring power supply and reused the indoor cam plug on the power supply as it fits perfect and locks in. I obtained 120v power from a nearby electrical outlet, and brought my wire into the box from behind the wall. I mounted the ring power supply on the back of the electrical box, and prepped the box to accept the camera. I created a clear acrylic template and was able to use that to cut out the blank wall plate. What’s really nice is I can still unscrew the wall plate and easily remove the cam if I need to do a reset or adjustment. This solved many issues for me and still provided an eye level video shot of persons entering the front door. Since the ceilings are 12’ high, mounting the cam at the ceiling with a downward angle wasn’t conducive in getting a good facial shot. This is just one example of several I have designed myself to combat issues most of us have dealing with wires, angles, placement, etc.

11.21.20: After almost a year of Ring use, I have to say I am disappointed in the Ring community forum, their tech support, and products. Just recently, I had two of the ID cams drop offline. No matter what I did, no luck getting them back to work. I actually unplugged a back up ID can and went to move it, that one also dropped offline and never came back up. Tech support was of no help, and the community forum mod just tells you to call in.

I would think using 10 ring cameras, I know a little about them. Based on my research, they connect to WiFi, but can’t get to the internet. It appears that there is a high probability that my ISP is blocking the camera for possible threats, even though I turned off my firewall, set up a DMZ zone, and just about created a WiFi bridge to push the Ring cameras too, they still won’t work. They don’t play nice since the last firmware update. So as they fail, I am replacing them with another company. Honestly, I don’t care what brand I use, as long as it works. Read the community forums, and see for yourself. Setting up cameras is not really that difficult, troubleshooting isn’t either as long as you have full control of all devices. Ring doesn’t allow for device control outside of normal settings. Also, Ring devices CAN NOT, be wiped clear of stored memory setting for your home network. It’s embedded in the device. Even if you remove it from your home network, and sell it. It still has your network mirrored in its memory. Found this by pure chance. At the very lease you should have the cams IP address to clear out stored info and reset it. Wow",fair
132,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",$49.99,5,"Well you have to understand is that when you buy a ring camera you have to buy a subscription in order to keep your videos that get recorded. If you don't, you can only detect motion as it's happening. And if you're like me who because I'm home and I know what motion is detecting I don't always look at the camera. But I could miss something at work, which ended up happening when my grandfather broke his leg because he had fallen but I didn't know how since I didn't record the video and I didn't check the camera at the time that it set off the motion detector.

But what I like about the camera is that the quality sounds pretty good in my opinion. Of course it doesn't sound like someone's right in the room with you talking as if everything is normal. But it does sound clear. I think the night vision camera is really good and I think the video quality is pretty decent. I usually can see everything going on in my house when it's happening.

In fact, the power adapter that came with the cameras was for 110-220V/50-60 cycles, so there was no problem at all. See the picture I uploaded.
I downgraded the overall rating, even though I awarded five stars for the night vision, motion detection and picture quality I was a bit disappointed in the vertical field of the picture.

140,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,4,"Due to my answer in the QA section receiving many endorsement, i decided to give it a bit more detailed review after 2 weeks into owning the Blink setup. I came from Simplisafe, and i still do have simplisafe's alarm system, but due to their lack of outdoor camera solution, i finally decided to pull the trigger on the latest Outdoor blink and try out the Mini blink as well.

First thing's first, the new Outdoor Blink cam works mostly as advertised but the indoor Blink Mini is junk. Read more about the Mini below. But first the Outdoor (good)

Blink Outdoor:
Motion recording speed & Delay:
The Outdoor cam's trigger time is almost instant, in fact, I noticed that it even records a second before entering the frame. which tells me that it might be doing some kind of constant recording into the cam's onboard volatile memory as cache, and once motion is triggered it starts encoding the data and dumps it onto the cloud. So the trigger time is almost instant. However, note that there is a 5 second delay from what's happening Live vs what you see on your phone. so that delay is between Trigger --> Encode --> Cloud --> Decode. I""d imagine that if your Cam is connected to a wifi bridge as oppose to directly to the main router, the delay could be longer than 5 seconds. Compare to Simplisafe cam, the Live vs View delay is about the same. and the trigger time is about the same too.

Motion sensor & sensor distance.
the motion sensor distance in the Outdoor cam is less than 25 ft. despite what the feature ad would tell you. i have 4 Cams (3 outdoor setup at an angle pointing down 45 degree angle, and 1 in the garage looking pretty much straight flat at my car), 3 of the outdoor ones could pretty much trigger 15~20ft out, while the one in the garage struggles to even trigger at 15 ft. You should also take night vision into account. in NV mode, the distance is 5ft shorter. increasing the IR blast in NV will somewhat mitigate the problem but at a cost of battery drain. i tried moving the cam in garage from pointing 45 degree down to looking almost straight horizontal to improve motion sensing to a degree. So if you have trouble with the motion sensor, try that. Compare to Simplisafe's cam, the Simplicam seems to have farther motion sensing distance. But then again, Simplisafe still doesn't have an outdoor solution.

Speaker/Mic
the speaker and Mic quality is really good. it doesn't sound overly tiny like you would expect and is loud and clear. compare to Simplicam, the Blink Outdoor has better sound and mic.

Wifi Wireless
i was surprised how well the wireless works. lots of complains in the review about wireless distance, not sure if they're genuine. but my farthest cam is about 80ft away from my main router thought a living room, a dining room and a garage and garage door (just shy of the max 100ft advertised in the spec), i am still able to get above 33% wifi N signal. But i think a lot of this ""might"" depend on the quality of your Wifi router. i spared no expense on my home wifi. So my router is 3x3 beam forming top of the line AC router that also has a very wide 802.11 N coverage. it can reach far and carry lots of bandwidth. my advice is invest in a quality wifi router with the most bandwidth and range you can afford. Note that the cams and module only supports 802.11 N. Compare to Simplicam, the wifi signal reach is about the same, if not slightly better than the Simplicam.

AC Wireless.
part of the charm and strength about the Blink Outdoor is its battery powered wireless nature. Only time will tell how long my Cams will last. I will update this review and reflect the score once my first set of battery run out. My gut tells me it'll be less than 2 years, well less. but i'd be happy if i can get even 1 year out of those cams. Note that the advertised 2 year battery life from Amazon is based on roughly 2 mins of video footage per day per cam. One of my busiest cam facing out the front door is seeing 2~3 times that amount.

Resolution/video quality
the resolution of the cam and video compression is really good. compare to those legacy 480p outdoor cams, this was a big step up. but compare to the simplicam, i would say the image looks slightly sharper than the Simplicam. but note that true 1080p resolution is only possible with high quality video record setting, which can chew up your battery and storage. Amazon's 2 year battery life is based on medium setting, which is actually 720p. but even at the medium setting, i still find the image to be very sharp and clear. going from medium to high (1080p) setting yield ""some"" improvement viewing on a smart phone. you likely won't be able to find big difference viewing it on a smartphone unless you view both videos on a large monitor. oh which btw, currently there's no app available for desktop computers. you'll have to either download the footage or pull the backup off your thumb drive to view it on a dekstop.

Storage
ok, this is the most contentious and messed up part. the ad made you believe that you don't need to subscribe to cloud and able to store locally. what they don't explain to you is that local storage is only a secondary option on top of the cloud subscription. so you CANNOT, at least at the point of this review, store your recordings directly to the USB thumb drive and read off of it directly. how the Blink cam works right now is everything gets dumped to their cloud server, and when you view the footage, it reads off their cloud server. the USB thumb drive is just there to backup ""from their cloud server"" ""once a day"". there is no way for you to have the cams upload recordings directly to the thumb drive locally and view them from your phone wirelessly off the USB Thumbdrive. There're a lot of people asking about this question on forums and, like me, only found this out after the fact. It's not a deal breaker, but it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Why not just come out and say it. It's simply misleading. if you go to their website, and dig, and i mean really dig, you'll find that there is a way to run it without subscription. but any motion trigger or live views will not be recorded. So what's the point of local storage? it's almost like they just want to find a way to cramp that ""local storage"" wording into their ad to sell you the product only to find out that it's a secondary backup on top of a pay subscription.

Now onto Blink mini (junk)

Blink mini on the other hand. To put it simply is junk or an opportunity wasted. the Blink Mini has a long standing bug that plagued the camera for at least 2 years, and the dev team still hasn't released a fix. The issue with Blink Mini is that it fails to trigger motion recording coming out of night vision mode when you enter the room to turn the lights on. the dev team explained that something to do with the cam goes into freeze mode when it attempts to wake itself out of night vision to do recording. for that reason, it's pretty much trash if you intend on using the Mini as any kind of indoor security cam. I originally intended to use the Mini in my garage to monitor my prized stallion. But i literately would go into my garage and walk up to the car and no motion or recording is triggered. Dev has acknowledged this issue since late 2018 and said in 2019 forum post that firmware update is coming to fix this. it is now end of 2020, i would not count on it. The only reason i kept my Mini and ordered another Outdoor cam for the garage is so that in any case when we go on vacation, i can set the Mini up in the living room to do live view. But if you're thinking about getting the Mini for motion triggered security cam indoor, forget it. don't say i didn't warn you.

Software UI/UX
the interface for the app is easy to use and more organized than many other similar services. clips are organized with usable filters at your disposal. the motion sensing manual dead zone configuration is helpful, although likely not too useful if you're using it outdoor, since the ""motion sensor"" distance (not wifi distance) is well shy of advertised 25ft.

OVERALL
the new Outdoor blink has a lot going for it. If they can fix their advertisement wording, or better, let us have the option to record directly to the USB Thumb drive and be able to view the recording from our devices directly from the thumbdrive. it'll then be a True local storage solution. the only reason i ditched my Simplicam is because i really wanted to have smart Cams covering my house outdoor. Been 3+ years since Simplisafe said that they would come out with an outdoor solution. But till this day, still nothing. i just got tired of waiting. When i saw the new Blink Outdoor being advertised for Black Friday, i really wanted to give it a try. i would say the barrier to entry is minimal. the Blink hardware given the discount that amazon has been giving out, is worth the shot. Without the deep discounts, i am not so sure. They just need to improve the motion sensor distance coverage, and let us really use the USB thumb drive for storage. In a sea of smart home security market today. Amazon really needs to do more to win over customers and not only that, to keep them there. If they can combine Ring with Blink, i might just ditch my Simplisafe completely and go Ring to combine their alarm system with Blink. If they can do that, i don't mind paying the $10/month subscription. But at its current state, they still have work to do to win over customers.

i will update the review on the battery life",positive
141,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,3,"Empecemos por decir que lo que ofrece el producto es lo que vas a obtener ni mas ni menos.

El producto es totalmente inalámbrico , lo que le da ventajas a la hora de una instalación limpia rápida y sin cables a simple vista.

La conexión vía remota desde el celular a través de app es genial y muy fluida, cuando quieres ver los videos, aunque la conexión con mi dispositivo echo show 5 a sido casi imposible para el control de voz y para la visión en vivo tiene un delay bastante desagradable.

La duración de las baterías es excelente tengo 5 camaras instaladas y una de ellas esta en la entrada del conjunto residencial, lo que hace que diariamente este por las 70 notificaciones de movimiento promedio con sus respectivos videos y aun después de un mes dice que esta sobre el 70% de vida.

Las notificaciones son casi que en tiempo real max unos 10 a 15 seg después de la detección de movimiento llega la notificación a la app de celular, pero la conexión con alexa en mi caso a sido terrible y bastante deprimente porque me decidí por el producto justo por esa función y no he podido darle solución a los errores constantes entre alexa y el skill de blink.

Ahora indaguemos mas en lo tecnico y por lo cual me ha decepcionado un poco el sistema.

Este no es un sistema de vigilancia de video es mas en mi opinión un sistema de alarma de movimiento con capacidad de grabar el evento que activo la señal de alarma, aunque muchas veces ese video termina por frustrarte mas y a continuación explico el porque

El sistema solo puede grabar entre 5 seg y 60 seg de grabación y aunque a veces 60seg es mucho tiempo, tiene una opción que permite parar el video antes si el movimiento se detiene, pero aca es donde comienza el problema en realidad, si activas esta opción, el sistema tiene una contra que la camara al desactivarse tarda 10 seg en volver a estar lista para registrar otra alerta lo cual hace que a veces pierdas información valiosa en cuanto a seguridad, si el movimiento para y luego se reactiva mientras la camara esta en el reposo de los 10seg, la camara no registrara nada en video y si el intruso sale fuera del rango de detección ya no podrás saber que paso luego, incluso si el movimiento llegar a seguir después de los 60seg max de grabación por alerta, la camara entraría en ese mismo tiempo de descanso de 10seg.

Aunque las alertas en la app son muy rápidas este Tiempo se puede ver afectado si la opción de alertas rápidas no esta activada, ya que esta viene desactivada por defecto y si no se activa en cada camara puedes tener unas que te avisen y otras que las notificaciones llegue siempre tarde o después que ya se detecto el movimiento.

En resumen si lo que quieres es un sistema de alerta de movimiento o cercanía este es el sistema que debería comprar pero si quieres un sistema de vigilancia de video busca otras opciones.

Dentro de amazon hay varias opciones de camara ptz wifi con grabación continua, detección de movimiento, alarma sonora y audio doble vía que trabaja muy similar a este sistema y con una memoria de 32gb tienes hasta 4 dias de grabación continua y son mas económicos, aunque no son tan excelentes como este en visión de video en vivo o revisando archivos de alarma te serán mas útiles si lo que buscas es un sistema cctv, por lo menos en mi opinión.

Postdata aun no se como funciona el sistema sin la membresía a Blink plus aun estoy dentro de la prueba gratis y aunque ya tengo todo el sistema para grabación local pronto volveré con mi opinión de como se porta el sistema una ves no tengas el soporte de Blink Plus.

--------------------------------------------------------

Let's start by saying that what the product offers is what you are going to get, no more, no less.

The product is completely wireless, giving you the advantage of a quick clean installation without wires at a glance.

The remote connection from the cell phone through the app is great and very fluid, when you want to watch the videos, although the connection with my echo show 5 device has been almost impossible for voice control and for live viewing it has a delay quite unpleasant.

The duration of the batteries is excellent, I have 5 cameras installed and one of them is at the entrance of the residential complex, which means that every day there are 70 average movement notifications with their respective videos and even after a month it says that it is over 70% life batteries.

Notifications are almost in real time, max about 10 to 15 seconds after motion detection, the notification arrives on the mobile app, but the connection with alexa in my case has been terrible and quite depressing because I decided on the right product for that function and I have not been able to solve the constant errors between alexa and the blink skill.

Now let's dig deeper into the technical and for which the system has disappointed me a bit.

This is not a video surveillance system, it is more in my opinion a motion alarm system with the ability to record the event that activated the alarm signal, although many times that video ends up frustrating you more and I will explain why below.

The system can only record between 5sec and 60sec of recording and although sometimes 60sec is a long time, it has an option that allows you to stop the video earlier if the movement stops, but this is where the problem really starts, if you activate this option, the system has a counter that when the camera is deactivated, it takes 10 seconds to be ready again to record another alert, which sometimes means that you lose valuable information regarding security, if the movement stops and then reactivates while the camera is At rest for 10 seconds, the camera will not record anything on video and if the intruder goes out of the detection range, you will no longer be able to know what happened next, even if the movement continues after the maximum 60 seconds of recording by alert, the camera would enter that same rest time of 10sec.

Although the alerts in the app are very fast, this Time can be affected if the quick alerts option is not activated, since it is deactivated by default and if it is not activated in each camera you can have some that notify you and others that Notifications always arrive late or after motion has already been detected.

No me In short, if what you want is a movement or proximity alert system, this is the system you should buy, but if you want a video surveillance system, look for other options.

Within amazon there are several wifi ptz camera options with continuous recording, motion detection, sound alarm and two-way audio and lights that works very similar to this system and with a 32gb memory you have up to 4 days of continuous recording and they are cheaper, although They are not as excellent as this one in viewing live video or reviewing alarm files. They will be more useful if you are looking for a cctv system, at least in my opinion. Postscript I still don't know how the system works without Blink plus membership I'm still in the free trial and although I already have the entire system for local recording I'll soon come back with my opinion on how the system behaves once you don't have Blink support Plus.",fair
142,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,1,"REVIEW UPDATE

We recently lost our internet connection due to updates our ISP had to make. What we didn't know is that Blink cameras are solely dependent on an Internet connection (not just a wifi connection) even if you don't have a subscription or just have the trial. None of the outdoor cameras will remain active when you lose Internet connectivity. My wrongful assumption was that ONLY your local area network was needed since it relies on a wifi signal. Nope. That is wrong. The Sync Modules will flash the green LED and no camera will work. Great job Blink/Amazon for putting customers at risk to thieves and other criminals.

We have 4 of the outdoor cameras on two separate Sync2 Modules due to the distance from the main router. We have an extender (set as a repeater) which handles the furthest cameras. As I said I never considered these would go offline if the Internet connection went down. I figured if my LAN went down then it would make total sense the cameras would go offline, yet I was foolish in my thinking.

Again this is shameful of Blink/Amazon to have this even as a feature. I get that you need an account to pay for the service, but why in the world would these be designed to FAIL if your Internet connection goes down?

It is not only misleading to consumers to not EXPLICITLY state that these cameras will fail to operate without an Internet connection.

This IS one of the WORST investments my family ever made in a product. Would have been better to purchase a CCTV camera system and just hardwired everything on the network. For what we've now paid for 4 cameras + the sales tax we could have gotten a 4 camera CCTV setup instead from a local box store.

As I have said in my original review, the cameras do work, and will suffice. Keep in mind that an Internet connection is REQUIRED and not just your local area network connection. I had to lower my rating to just one star because nothing is lower than that on Amazon's site. I'd give this camera system negative stars it it were possible just based on our experience over the past few months.

Also I think I was far too generous with parts of my original review, but experience will change your mind when the experience becomes bad.

I no will longer recommend ANY of the Blink cameras. Until they are no longer dependent on an Internet connection and will fully function on just your local networks wifi signal. I will be researching a true CCTV camera system to replace the Blink cameras. If I could get a refund I'd do it in a heartbeat, but that window has closed. The price of this education is high!

---------
Original review

Recently purchased the Blink Outdoor 2 Camera system, and it's a very hit or miss system. I have several things to say about the security cameras and the Blink app that goes with it.

The base:

The friction fit mounting bases are not easy to snap into place. I had to use a long and think flat headed screw driver to aid in connecting it. Also I worried about crushing the sensor on the camera because of how much force it takes and where my hands are pressing on the camera itself (holding from the edges while mounting under a roof eave is moderately annoying). Once it is finally snapped to the base it moves freely and the camera stays in place.

The Sync 2 Module

This is the brains of the system. Each module controls up to 10 cameras and utilizes your 2.4GHz Wifi connection. Now I mistakenly assumed that my 2 camera system didn't include the Sync 2 Module (I didn't notices a ""what's in the box"" on Blinks Amazon page. So I ended up buying one which was a waste of money considering it's included. The setup takes a while after you power it on you'll need the app to discover the device. Initially the blue LED flashes and the green LED is steady. Once it is discovered then then both LEDs are steady.

The app (Android)

At first the app to control this camera system seems simple, but there are some annoyances I've discovered. The system will NOT discover the best WiFi connection on your network. I have an detached garage with the camera approximately 75 feet from the Sync 2 Module, and my router is close to 10 feet from the Sync 2 Module. So I picked up a WiFi extender and set it as a Repeater (firewall, DNS, DHCP etc. is controlled by my primary router) in order for the signal strength to be at a maximum. It is recommended that you use the existing WiFi names (SSIDs) on your network (for 2.4GHz only) and append _EXT so Blink can see it if using a Wifi extender. Also keep your password keys for your wifi extender the exact same that are on your main wifi router. Now in theory (and based on Blink's own guidelines) the system should pick the best Wifi signal based on your setup. Well it doesn't, and there is NO option in the Blink app for me to place my garage camera on the extender Wifi (again it's on the same network as all my devices are) while keeping the door camera on the primary router (same network once again). This is not about changing networks, this is about discovering the extender on my main network (which I repeat Blink claims it will chose the best signal automatically). Yes I could add the second Sync 2 Module in the garage, but then I'd have to create a second system for the garage camera. Not entirely what you should have to do.

Batteries: These cameras require the more expensive Lithium AAs you do get the batteries with the cameras (mine were Energizer Lithium AAs. The cameras are equipped with a USB B mini connection which you can use to connect to a powered USB source as to not run off batteries. In my case I picked up a motion detector LED flood light that offers a USB connection (this unit https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08F9CNPVW). I would remove the batteries from the cameras because I do not know if connected will it try to charge the batteries (these are NON chargeable lithium batteries) or it will it bypass the batteries? I would err on the side of caution and remove them.

Local Storage (USB thumb drive) vs Blink Subscriptions

This is an Amazon product and you'd think that the Blink camera systems would provide free service to Amazon Prime members. Nope. You are nickled and dimed on a per camera basis at $6 monthly, and it's $100 annually (if I read it right) for one full system). Again why is this NOT part of Prime Membership?

So to avoid saving to the cloud I bought a 256GB thumb drive to insert into the Sync 2 Module. What I have discovered is ONLY clips are saved locally. You are NOT able to save live recordings to the local storage. Really? Why? What's the point of only having the clips (maxed at 60 seconds) on a local drive? To me this is a rip off and not mentioned anywhere in the product details.

Yes you do get a ""free"" trial which unlocks all features. If you; however, cancel that trial early or let it expire without buying a subscription than certain features are locked. So again you pay a lot for the camera system and you are locked out of many features IF you don't buy their subscription to the cloud. Talk about ripping folks off. Sure you can look at live feeds, but you can't same them locally. You can take a snapshot from the cameras, but it will NOT take a photo every hour UNLESS you BUY a Blink subscription. Again this all goes back to Blink subscriptions. Tell me what's the point of local storage if all you can save are clips?

Loading issues with clips and thumbnails. So I've run into issues where loading a clip from the connected USB drive fails to load 95% of the time. Again these are short clips and should pull faster than from the Cloud. Nope. Thumbnails are hit or miss. These are generated when you press the camera icon on the home screen of the app. I call them snaps, but I've noticed if I am sitting near the Sync 2 Module it can still fail. Full wifi bars too and it still fails.

Alexa:

It is claimed by Blink that the newest generation of their cameras will work with Alexa. I used the app from my phone, but she can't do anything with the cameras (even when trained to use them). In this case you may have to buy an Alexa enabled device (like Show). You technically don't need one they are NOT required for these cameras, but the Alexa app alone on a smartphone is limited.

Finally the recommend having minimum Internet speeds of 2Mb up and down for these cameras, but I believe that is ONLY if you are saving and storing to the cloud along with accessing from the cloud. Locally your access to the Blink cameras will depend on your network speeds along with wifi. The more stuff you have connected the slower it can be.

Conclusion. The Blink Camera System isn't terrible, and they are affordable. There are quirks as I mentioned and annoyances I have dealt with. These are not high end systems but on a tight budget you can get a good start.",negative
143,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,1," FINAL UPDATE: What was once pretty cool and recommended is now completely useless. If you don't subscribe they take away features and the entire system no longer works right.. They want you to pay every month.. $10/month that's $120 a year.. They also want you to link your Amazon account. Make sure to read the fine print.. Blink wants your Amazon data.. I've spent over $2,000 on these cameras.. Now all of it is useless.. Short clips blurred images glitches all the time deleted clips reappear sometimes it doesn't even record no live view saves, sensors don't pick up anything audio goes out, it all turned to trash. They want to blame it on your wifi. 🙄 They are throttling controlling how well your cameras work.. I feel so betrayed and swindled. I've been recommending these cameras even set my parents up told friends now it's all a waste because Blink wants to be shady.. VERY DISAPPOINTING DO NOT REWARD COMPANIES LIKE THIS WITH YOUR MONEY. 👎🤨

UPDATE: 4/28/21 - 8 or so months in. I have purchased 17 of these cameras and 3 sync modules and planned on buying more also purchased many accessories. Different mounting brackets for the cameras and modules wifi extenders larger battery packs etc. They all worked great at first then slowly came the problems. I put up with the failed views the super short recordings that happened now n then the modules going offline repeatedly no its not my internet the glitches etc ... Now something about a PLUS PLAN suddenly pops up on my app. You can no longer save live clips. 😡 One of the cool things was being able to watch something live then being able to save it. You cannot do that simple little thing anymore.

The cloud storage wasn't that big of a deal since you could pop in a thumbdrive to save recordings. Now they want to charge you for the ability to save live views onto your thumbdrive. It was cool and convenient the ability to view something live catch something happening which is the whole point of a camera then saving it. Now if you catch something happening live its useless because you can't save it. 😡 The system has to be armed and you have to hope the sensors pick it up and even then it may not even reset. They ruined the playback on the app now. No thumbnails and if you want to delete you have to delete clips separately no select all option. This is NOT WORTH BUYING anymore. For the amount of money I spent I should be able to save a short live view. I could have purchased a nicer security system for the money I spent. I no longer recommend this system as they want to charge you a monthly fee for a simple feature a doorbell cam can do. At bare minimum they should not charge Prime Members a subscription fee. Very disappointing that they change the functionality so they can charge you for it. My original review and updates are below.
👇😕

This is pretty close to a must have they just need to make some tweaks. 🤙 Picture quality is pretty good. It has a nice dynamic range. The POV is pretty good. Its plenty wide and a little fisheye. For the most part pretty clear. 👍

The audio is fairly decent but you get a lot of humming and hissing. The microphone where you can talk to someone is fairly decent. You're talking about close distance about average distance of someone at your front door.

The setup is pretty easy just install the app and follow the instructions. Let it update the firmware. One tip when you get to the cameras leave the back off because you will have to scan the QR code.

So why not 5 stars since this is pretty cool? The back where you put the batteries screws on and off with a wonky tool they give you. It would be fine if it was a twist lock not an actual screw. The price is kinda steep. I needed 4 cameras. 4 sides to a house or building right? They don't have a 4 camera bundle. 3 or jump to 5. I purchased another single camera because it was only $10 more with a sync module than a add on camera.

Not much security for the camera itself. It just pops off. Anyone can steal it. The camera mount has a limited angle. Its basically made for a straight flat install. I bought separate swivel mounts so I can mount it to the underside of my roof on the side of my house and place the camera looking down the side of my house. They should upgrade the mount. You can always mount the camera higher to avoid theft but sometimes that's limited.

After awhile there's inconsistencies short clip recordings failed views no restart recordings after the pause and the longest you can record is 30 seconds and it won't fully record the full 30 secs. Audio cuts out or doesn't record at all and lots of freezes. 😐

This is a pretty good simple to set up and use camera system. The night vision and motion detection are pretty decent. They should have kept the free cloud storage but i prefer the separate thumbdrive storage. Less chances of hacking being all over the interweb. Using a thumbdrive is not a problem. Maybe they should include one. There's a slight delay in the live shot. Hear something and you wanna click live view you wait a few seconds and by that time the action is gone. They need to make that faster. As for getting notifications instantly when the motion detection is triggered its not bad but there's a delay there too. And it does not recognize or connect to my 5G only to 2.4G on my wifi. 😐 Like I said its pretty decent but could use some improvements and am sure they will continue to do so but for now for what I'm using it for as simple security and being able to monitor my house and yes I can be away and monitor my house from afar yeah definitely worth getting. 👍

UPDATE: Its been a month and a half and the batteries are still good. I do notice not as much hissing and screeching noise. Don't know if that means battery life is going down and the mic is less powered or what but everything still works pretty good. Picked up several of the mini cams as well on sale. Great for inside and the garage. Had one on the patio but it got a little moisture slime. Didn't affect the camera though but I did move it in.

Had one hick up. It said view failed or something like that once and I couldn't get a live view. I just took a photo and it seemed to clear that up. I see a lot of people showing that in the reviews so thought that would help.

I also see a lot of reviews posting pics of bad night vision. You need to reposition your camera. You either have something below it or above it too close to the lens. For example if you have it mounted under an awning and you get a dark picture or you get a foggy looking halo ring you need to bring the camera out further so there is not much covering the top or bottom. The sides are also affected but not as much.

Move it around remember camera position is key for good night vision. Even though it's made for the outdoors you don't want it in direct sunlight where the unit will go passed the 110deg limit. That will kill battery performance and camera capabilities. Hope that helps some of you with those issues. I will update again on battery life. So far its near Thanksgiving and batteries are good. I arm it at night 100% of the time. During the day a little less. I've captured several delivery personnel a raccoon a couple of cats sun glare off my pool some dust looking particles that look like spirits flying away 😄 and of course myself when I forget to disarm 😃 and the battery indicator says OK. They really need a percentage indicator on that. I live view several times a day but only for a few seconds if there's nothing going on.

The cloud thing is not a big deal at all. Get a thumbdrive and you're good to go. All your clips are saved on that instead of the cloud. I love the easy sharing too. I will text my friends with a short clip I can upload straight to my YouTube channel. Its pretty cool. One thing I would like to see is a shorter break between clips. You can miss a lot in 10 seconds. And a longer recording capability than 30sec especially with motion. I know that can eat battery life but they can improve there as well.🖖😉👍

UPDATE 2: I'm getting more failed to connect to cloud indications and I'm not using the cloud I'm using a thumbdrive. I'm also getting more false recordings. Nothing is happening and it will record a clip. Also a live view will pop up in the recorded clip segment. 🤔 Its starting to be a little fidgety but not to the point it upsets me.

UPDATE 3: One of the cameras needed a reset. Pop the batteries out then pop em back in. 🤔 It said failed view or not available something like that. Battery life is going on 3 months with moderate use. What's moderate use? I arm every night and 3 - 5 times a day. Take photos 2 - 3 times and watch live view 4 - 5 times a day. Each live view is for one cycle before it times out or asks to continue. Sometimes I'll watch live view for 3 - 4 times continued. Still haven't needed to replace batteries yet. 👍

Update 4: Colder weather is here and another camera needed a reset where you pop the batteries out wait 30secs and pop em back in. Battery still says ok and its going on 3 and a 1/2 months. It first gave me a failed to load warning here n there and that may be a sign you may need to do a reset.

Update 5: The inconsistencies have increased greatly. The syn module continually goes offline requiring a wifi reboot. The batteries are still good and it's been 6 months. There are more freezes and jumps in recordings.",negative
144,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,4,"I must preface this review by telling all that I am a mechanical klutz but semi-tech savvy. I should also advise that I only received and assembled this product a few hours ago so I will certainly learn more as time passes and I will amend this review accordingly. Having said that, there are a few things that I should mention for the benefit of all other klutz's out there. The first thing I noticed is that there are no detailed instructions! Everyone noted in Amazon revewes how easy installation was so I wasn't all that concerned when placing my order. I should have been. Inexcusable that there were no instructions. I resorted to going to You Tube and found a couple of videos that were very helpful. But even with the videos, I had some very simple but troubling issues. I am after all a klutz.

The first step in installation is to download the Blink app. Much to my surprise, the free Blink app is not compatible with a desktop PC Windows computer. It is primarily an Android app so I was compelled to download the app to my Android phone. Now I realize that most would not have an issue doing that but I wish I had known that because I prefer to control my surveillance systems on my PC. I suspect there may be 3rd party companies that offer Blink compatible software for PC's but again, I wish I had known beforehand. I am still investigating and will likely find a solution to use the app on my PC but for now, can only use compatible devices.

The cameras and the module are all wrapped in a thin and almost invisible plastic wrap. One of the first steps is to install the provided 2 Lithium AA batteries in the rear of each of the cameras. I finally figured out how to get the back plate/cover off the camera and it was a little frustrating. First, you should know that there is a rubber plug that covers the screw which holds the back plate. You need to take that plug out to access the screw. The kit provided a plastic key that fits into the screw and can be used to unscrew the screw. Simple right? Well, I turned and turned and turned the screw but the back plate would not come off. I finally figured out that there was a very thin and invisible plastic that wrapped around the edges of the camera body and that it had to be removed because it otherwise prevented the back plate from releasing once it was unscrewed. Yes, you have to have had eagle eyes to have seen that plastic film and it was a little tricky getting it off. (I warned you that I was a klutz.) Ok, so now that I removed the plastic, I found a notch in the back plate to help lift it out of the camera body. That now revealed the slots where to install the batteries and the slots were adequately marked to show polarity positions. But after you install the batteries - do not screw the cover back on. Why? Because you need to access the camera ID serial numbers. Again, I had to find this out on my own because there were no instructions! Also know that once you do screw the back plate back on, it should be orientated properly and there is only one way that will happen even though the cover will go on any way. The easiest way to orient the plate correctly is to ensure that the USB C port opening lines up with the USB C port on the camera.

Synching the module and each of the cameras was relatively easy so I won't belabor these steps. The You Tube videos were very helpful to get through these steps. But here's another setup klutz problem I came across. To mount the cameras, there are mounting bases that attach to the back of the camera body by snapping into that area where the screw is located. Sounds easy enough but it is a little tricky. First, understand that the mounts need to be screwed into whatever house structure your attaching the camera to. But the holes in the mount are situated in such a manner that it is impossible to access the holes once the camera is attached. So you need to first screw the mount on to the wall before attaching the camera. The only problem with that is you now have to snap the camera on to the mount and as I mentioned above, that was a little difficult.

OK, now that I had the cameras set up, figuring out how to work the system was another stumbling block. Again - no guidance because no instructions. Even being a little tech savvy, I had some difficulty. I found that the software was not as user friendly as I would have expected. OK, I am still playing with the system and learning but once again, it sure would help having instructions.",positive
145,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,5,"When we first purchased cams back in 2017, we compared to Arlo and Ring before we chose Blink. Now we are up to 10 cams, covering every angle of the house. Here are my findings after using them for almost 4 years (and still buying more):
PROS:
> #1 video quality is excellent. Day time is a bit better than night, but night vision is as good as it gets with cams. POSITION of your cam matters a ton. I started out putting them way high up and quickly realized - if you actually want identifying features - they need to be lower. Otherwise... yeah you see someone walking past, but you cant ID anything, so what is the use.
> So inexpensive - so easy to integrate. Anytime we have ANYTHING we need to cover, we just order another cam and it literally takes 5 minutes to get it out of the box, batteries in, and added to existing system.. seriously - 5 minutes.
> The app is great. Very intuitive. Our first cams had very few ""advanced features"" every time i order new cams, they have improved their features. Now you are able to zoom all the way in to very small areas, to capture certain areas and exclude others.. For example - old cams you had to block off large sections of the capture area to avoid the cams picking up movement from trees, but now you can pinpoint one little part of a branch on a tree to exclude if its triggering the cam.
> Motion detection is very sensitive - but they have it tweaked just about right. It never misses anything, but if you setup your exclusion zones well - you can get it almost perfect. I dont have a lot of false alarms and I'm running 10 cams. We have one setup to look at the sidewak, and after much tweaking, we can actually exclude the street... but pick up both sidewalks on both sides of the street. You can setup the app to alert you or not alert you.. you can turn sound on or off on alerts. On windy days I do end up just going into the app and turning off all cams that are setup around lots of trees until the storm is over.. but thats like a few times a year.
> Super easy playback and control of cams. It's instant - you can control them in any way, very easily. If I am working on a project in the yard, I dont want my cams on for hours, running out of batteries - so I just go into the app and turn them all off. It takes seconds. Likewise - if i hear a noise at night, super easy to open the app and live view any cam so i can look all around the house and see everything happening outside, from every angle.
> Extremely easy to move around. We have had them for years - so we move them around occasionally. I even had mice in our crawlspace under the house at one point and just grabbed one of the cams off the side of the house and stuck it down there so I could catch them at night. Theres no commitment with these - no hard wiring so you can mount them anywhere and taking them on and off the mount takes 2 seconds.
> No subscription needed to store clips. thats BIG for us. We would not like blink as much if they changed that. We run a lot of cams and it just stays 100% full storage - we can still access a few weeks worth of video, it just deletes oldest. You can download/save any videos.
> Lots of mounting options. You have to buy them separately if you want anything special, but I have 3 different types of mounts - one for trees, one around porches that need to be secured so they cant be taken, and then the standard mounts for cams not at risk of being taken. There are camo skins as well - I have on in a tree that you pretty much cant see unless you know its there.
> Customer support is super decent. In the winter of 2018, one of my cams took on a green hue to the image when the temp went down to about 10 degrees outside. I emailed customer service explaining the issue and sent a screenshot and within 24 hours they asked me for the SN of the cam, and did a firmware update that fixed it. I was quite happy with that.
CONS:
> So while the batteries are awesome because the cams are so easy to move around and deal with... i blow through batteries. Fortunately, i just get 20 packs of AA's, but with 10 cams - even though Blink ~says~ batteries can last a year? it totally depends on usage. So we get LOTS of traffic on our front cams because we live in a busy area and have people walking past all day. I change out the batteries on every one of those front cams once a month. Granted - thats many hundreds of video captures and ideally, we should connect those cams to electricity somehow - that is an option with blink, but I dont mind changing batteries. On the cams in the back yard and side paths - I really can go once or twice a year changing those, except for the ones that catch a lot of foot traffic. So the battery usage is totally dependent on traffic. Personally - the cams are a big deal to me, so i dont mind it at all. Benefits totally outweigh the downsides.
> The biggest difference between Blink and some other companies is that i see other people with hardwired cams that can catch EVERYTHING in a continuous fashion, for hours. like the surveillance videos you see online where the cam just happened to catch something happening down the street...Blink doesnt work that way. it only captures immediate video clips, triggered by motion activation. It does store all videos.. you can see something weird in your yard and look back through videos to find out what happened - but it isnt 24 hours of continuous video feed.
> You can get gaps in your videos. So it can capture 1 minute of video at a time, but then it takes a small break before it starts capturing again, so if something is happening and its videotaping an event - it will record an entire minute of excellent footage - but then it takes a 5 second break before it starts recording again. that doesnt sound like a long time, and for security it's not normally an issue.. the average bad guy is in and out quickly.. but it is annoying that it takes 5 seconds to re-trigger. So.... 2 minutes of continuous video... but in the middle of that 2 minutes.. a 5 second break.
OVERALL - Super high video quality... cams you can move around super easily... a very easy app... I love blink and the upsides far outweigh any downsides. I always recommend it to people when they ask. You can cover your entire house at a super affordable price, you dont need to be rich at all.. Our 3 year old cams are still as good as our brand new ones. The peace of mind the cams bring me is priceless. I know every single thing happening everywhere, all the time outside. The affordability made it possible so that nothing can ever surprise us.",positive
146,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,5," We've got some bad actors in the hood, so it was time to catch them with some irrefutable evidence. Our XT2 is a little old and our Arlos are acting stupid. Saw this come out and had to give it a shot. It was time to upgrade. Plus, the specs of the possibility of TWO YEAR BATTERY LIFE is mindblowing. It's probably a lot less, but my Arlos would last a week with $10 CR123 batteries, so that had to go. Anything had to be better than those dinosaurs.

Set up was fairly easy. There is no real printed instruction manual, but those are rare today. Scanned the QR code and my smartphone popped me to their website with tons of tips, info, and even setup videos. The entire setup process is QR from the new Sync Module 2 to the camera itself. So don't make the mistake of slapping the batteries in and closing the camera unit like I did before I scanned the QR code. Whoops. Took less than 15 minutes to setup and sync. Signed up for a new Blink account so the old one won't get confused - plus there's several weeks of free cloud storage right now. Boom.

Set it up in a tree ACROSS from my house this time. When I put it over my door, my old cameras would flag every car or pedestrian close and far. All I want to see is the jerk stealing my UPS packages, so I flipped the perspective. The HD is super clean and clear, and the camera is at least 30 feet from the sync module with no problems connecting. Big plus there. And, there's a pretty powerful little speaker in this unit! I was really surprised at the volume this thing can push for such a small speaker. Now, when this alerts me to funny business, maybe I'll be able to yell at the perps. Probably not, because they'll be long gone by the time I see the notification. Still, this feature could be useful in warning your kids from doing something silly when you're not home.

The live view was disappointing, since you have to keep clicking the app to continue the live view for longer than 10-ish seconds. So you can't use this as a spying device or a baby monitor. Bummer. Also, the default recording time was like 5 seconds, probably to maximize battery life. You can't catch much in 5 seconds. I adjusted mine in the settings to about 20 seconds. I'll sacrifice battery life to catch a bad actor. Plus, there's a battery pack you can attach to this unit to increase battery life. I'll update in the future to let you know how the battery goes.

Overall, I'm impressed with the new Blink outdoor. It's gonna rain here in Florida soon, so I'll let you know how that goes as well as night shots when available.",positive
147,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,5,"I was fortunate to buy in early on the Blink camera system. Therefore, I have the included cloud coverage. Only recently did I find out just what an advantage that was.

After buying my initial system, I continued to add cameras to the initial sync module. I ultimately ended up having two additional sync modules from systems I purchased after the original system. I was under the impression that all my cameras had to be connected to the original sync module to continue receiving free cloud coverage.

I currently have a mixture of cameras to include 3-XT2, 4-Outdoor, 1-Indoor (2nd gen) and 2-Mini. I was using a schedule to arm the cameras, but I was disappointed that the system would not allow individual scheduling for each camera.

I recently decided to use my additional sync modules to divide my cameras into different zones and allow myself to set different schedules for each zone. Even if it meant the additional modules would not include free cloud coverage, I felt the scheduling control would be worth it.

I was happily surprised to find that even the newer modules set up under the original system included free cloud coverage. Therefore, I now have three different zones that can be individually scheduled. And furthermore, I can add up to 10 cameras to each module.

I only ran into one problem with the setup. The second module I had purchased had been sitting in the box for probably about a year. When I tried to add a camera to it, it would not connect. I called customer support and the first person wasn’t able to help me. I decided to investigate the problem myself and noticed there was a huge difference in the firmware on the second module.

I expected that the firmware of the second module would automatically update, and there was no way to initiate an update within the App. Since it didn’t automatically update, I called customer service back and told them the problem. The individual I spoke with didn’t seem to understand the issue, so I simply insisted that the module’s firmware had to be updated by them.

It took a number of increments to finally update the firmware once the issue had been escalated to the appropriately skilled technician. I insisted that the customer service representative stay on the line until the firmware of the second module exactly matched that of the existing module. I wasn’t trying to go through another 30 minute hold and 20 minute update again.

After the firmware was updated, I was able to add cameras to the second module. I will monitor the module to make sure future firmware updates occur.

I realize that the cloud coverage or camera support may change or discontinue in the future. But for the time being, I’m quite happy with my Blink system.",positive
148,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,3,"I've purchased a total of 4 Blink Outdoor + 3 Blink Mini cameras, plus a sync module and USB backup drive for the security system at my retail space. It's honestly probably the best and easiest way to get a security system installed without wires at a small business. Yes I have used Ring, and Canary. I prefer Blink. Since I’ve seen this now at brick and mortar retail locations, in addition to Amazon, I figure a review might help you make an informed purchase (spoiler, I love it).

This review really supports all of Blink’s camera products, as an ecosystem, though Amazon strangely would only let me review the standalone “Outdoor” camera. So you can infer details to the rest of Blink’s product lineup. You should know that Amazon purchased Blink in 2018, so I hope it gets some attention with new software features and hardware refresh.

Pros:
* Wireless. As long as you have reasonably good wifi, the cameras work. I use a mesh system to cover 6000+ sq ft of space, and all the cameras record and alert me.
* Battery. The outdoor cameras run on 2 AA lithium batteries. I don’t know how, but they last WAY longer than comparable rechargeable batteries for competing camera brands
* Price. Blink’s system is very price competitive. The mini cameras are downright cheap. The Outdoor cameras are competitive, considering how long the battery lasts, how small they are, how easy they are to install, and the superb reliability.
* Footage. Blink paid plan is cheap and stores a month of
* App. It’s simple and straightforward. Easy to view alert footage, and pull up recent footage. Wish it was easier to organize/review past footage… once you’re past a week it get tedious and hectic to find anything quickly and efficiently.
* Communication: You can speak into your phone with the app open and have a 2-way conversation with any party present at individual cameras. I’ve used this feature to communicate with staff, and also warn maleficent actors to leave the premises before I notify authorities.
* Sensitivity: You can customize a bunch of the toggles for camera recording, active area, sensitivity etc which is great. It’s not quite as intuitive as Ring or Canary which literally let you draw areas to avoid or record, but the toggles for the recording area as well as sensitivity triggers, recording length, quality, notification lights, etc are intuitive and great.

Cons:
* Multiple Locations: Currently Blink does not allow you to have multiple locations for your Blink system. This is a real bummer because I would easily buy this same system for my home, office, and to help keep an eye on my elderly parents at their house. Unfortunately you can’t. To do this you have to have a separate Blink account for each location, and manually log out and then log in to the location you want to pay attention to. That defeats the purpose of a security system, if you can’t receive timely notifications from all of your security cameras. If you have to manually review footage, it’s too late to help.
* User Access: Another big annoyance is you can’t selectively invite users to access your account with different access permissions. So currently I am the only person reviewing my Blink account. It would be a big help to delegate managers and other authorized administrators, especially in a multi-location environment where you want your family to have access to home security, your staff access to office security, but don’t want those groups to see the other cameras. I hope Blink implements robust user invitations and sharing access once Multiple Locations is supported.
* Geo-Fencing: There is no geolocated ability to arm, disarm, or set location-based trigger schedules for Blink. It’s either time, or manual arming or disarming. I also use a Canary system, and one of the big perks is the ability to have the system automatically switch gears if you or particular people come and go from a location. Wish I could do that for Blink, to have it automatically arm itself with the most sensitive settings when my staff leaves the location for the night.
* Auto-Delete: Once your USB drive is full, expect daily notifications that “local storage is full”. It asks you to delete footage to make room for more, which is pointless, because at the end of each day it will automatically do this (since the USB drive automatically clears old footage as needed, but still sends the annoying notification about storage being full).

Other:
* Neighbors App: Integrates with a community, I don’t use this much, but great feature to have especially for neighborhood safety.
* Amazon: You purchase your premium subscription through Amazon, and link your Amazon account to your Blink account.
* Alexa Integration: I use a series of Alexa devices with screens throughout the retail space to quickly look at cameras if I get an alert with my phone. Take a second to wake each camera (especially battery-operated Outdoor cams), and is very useful for safety and suspicious activity.
* Outdoor Mount: The outdoor cameras can be easily “popped” off their mount, if a maleficent person knows what’s up and decides to take a camera.
* Battery Life: The battery life of Blink Outdoor with 2 AA Lithium is good enough to not be a con. However the battery life is significantly less than “2 years” advertised. So far I’ve had to change the batteries on all four of my Outdoor cameras about every 3-4 months. Unfortunately there’s no alert or indicator to tell you if the battery is about to die. It’s either “OK” or the camera goes offline (with a slow blinking red light on the physical device).

VERDICT:

Blink is a great system, I totally recommend it as long as you only have one location and you are the sole user. The price is great, the performance is reliable with quality coverage, and it’s comparable, if not better than competitors.

If you need security systems at multiple residences or other locations, want to automate the system arming/triggers based on your geo-location, and need to invite and grant specific access to different people (friends vs staff) you should definitely avoid Blink and look to Canary or Ring for a security solution.

If the three major cons were address I would easily increase my rating from 3 to 5 stars. I hope Blink (and Amazon) is listening!",fair
149,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,4,"I've only had these outdoor cameras for a few days, so I won't comment on battery life yet. But overall, I'm very happy with these cameras and most of their features. I'm nitpicking a bit here, which is why there are so many Cons. They are minor issues outweighed by the Pros.

PROS:
* Setup was relatively simple--once you understand it--but the instructions weren't (see below)
* Infrared is awesome in the darkest environments and does a good job switching between IR and non-IR automatically
* Motion detection works well, as does the 1-9 sensitivity setting, although this requires some tweaking until you find the right setting for each camera
* Daytime video quality is excellent and good enough to read stationary license plates up to about 50 feet.
* Audio quality is amazing! Individual birds and nearby bees can be heard easily, and normal volume conversations within about 20 feet can be understood.

CONS:
* The cameras seem to require an active Internet connection, not just a wifi connection (although I could be wrong). This may be because the initial setup requires you to use cloud storage. This could become a problem if your Internet connection is lost or dropped.
* Initial setup requires storage in the cloud (for the free trial), even if you install a USB drive in the sync module. I have not found a way to disable the cloud storage. This cloud storage requirement may be slowing down the entire system, since it forces everything to constantly use the Internet.
* Setup instructions were weird and unintuitive. The included booklet simply said to install the app. And the app is kind of confusing at first, and I ended up trying to create an account (and failing) and adding the sync module several times until I figured out what it was doing (and I'm an experienced techie). The basic problem is the app requires cameras to be installed only by following certain steps, with no other option.
* Setup requires the mobile app and an active internet connection to install the cameras.
* Accessing the cameras and video clips requires the mobile app. There are no desktop app or web options.
* Cannot schedule individual cameras. The weekly/hourly schedule can only be set for all cameras attached to a sync module. This is unfortunate and will make the scheduling feature useless for most people. It would also be helpful to be able to set quality, motion detection sensitivity, and IR settings on a schedule. The settings I use for night time would be different than the middle of the day or when I'm not at home.
* No quality setting on the audio. There are multiple settings for quality of the videos, to conserve batteries, but there's no way to turn down the audio quality, for battery conservation. The included audio quality is great, but it seems to be ""too"" high for the purpose of these cameras.
* Only 2 AA batteries in each camera. This could become very cumbersome to replace batteries if your camera is installed in a hard-to-reach location. The cameras SHOULD have 6, 8, or 10 batteries instead, so you don't have to replace them often. I would happily pay the extra battery cost so that I wouldn't have to climb up there very often.
* When a camera is ""in use"", its settings cannot be changed, and if you try to change the settings, you'll get an error message, causing the app's settings screen to get out of sync with the camera's actual settings, until you go back and modify the settings again.
* The ""Talk"" feature produces garbled, broken, delayed (by 3-5 seconds) audio that is unintelligible, no matter how close the camera and sync module are to your router. I have about 115 Mbps bandwidth, and it made no difference. You will never be able to use this to have a conversation of any type, even if they could understand what you're saying. This seems like a very odd flaw since the recorded audio is so excellent. This was obviously an oversight by the engineers.
* The Android app's setting to disable the vibration on notifications doesn't work. It always uses my phone's setting and ignores the app's setting.
* Insects near my 4 cameras are causing 15-30 false alerts per day right now, until I can figure out a better placement or setting. Other than the wear on the batteries, this is not a huge deal, but it can be annoying.
* The installation hardware is inadequate. Each camera comes with 2 large wood screws that are too big and too long for almost every installation. Much smaller wood screws and double-sided tape or Velcro would have been much more practical. I ended up not using any of the screws that came with the cameras because they were too big or impossible to use on the required surfaces.
* The back panels on the cameras are VERY weird to remove for battery installation. There are no instructions that I could find on how to do this, and the included plastic tools are not intuitive. I nearly broke one of the cameras trying to get the back panel off using the included tool. There's a certain trick to hooking and unhooking the tool from the back panel that you'll have to figure out on your own.
* The cameras and lenses are fully exposed to sunlight and weather, which is not ideal. The cameras should come with a small hood the lens or camera to protect it even more from weather and shade from light.
* User access cannot be customized. The only way to give someone access to a camera is to give them your password to your account and entire system. It would be helpful to be able to grant someone limited or temporary access, such as a neighbor, child, relative, or visitor.",positive
150,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Ring Solar Panel for Spotlight Cam Battery,$39.99 - $91.94,5,"Got this on a whim for a camera I have installed in a spot that isn't very accessible - most of my cameras are mounted where I can get to them to change out batteries.

For the stick up cams, installing this panel is simple - mount the stalk, slide on the panel, then remove the rubber plug on the back of the cam and plug it in. For mine it took a few minutes for ""Device Health"" to show that the panel was connected.

For those complaining about the cord length - yes it's somewhat an annoyance to have to deal with all the extra wire, but it would be even more of an annoyance to be forced to locate the panel somewhere far away from the camera (direct sun is best) and have the cord not reach.

My usual experience with solar panels is the panel coating tends to cloud up and the solar portion fails, so we'll see how this one fares.",positive
151,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Ring Solar Panel for Spotlight Cam Battery,$39.99 - $91.94,5,"I got 4 of these ""refurbished"" ones that were listed as used ""acceptable."". They were in excellent condition, though. I didn't expect them to still charge my StickUp Camera Battery without direct sunlight but it seems to charge when there was minimal sunlight... like there was a shadow of a palm tree over the solar panel but it still charges, slowly but it did. My battery went from 37% at 5 PM when I installed it to 39% at 8 PM after the sun had already set an hour before. I checked again the next day around 5 PM and noticed that my batteries were already at 100% charged (I installed 4 of them on 4 different cameras). My wired doorbell didn't even charge the doorbell battery to 50% after a day. Someone did a horrible job with low power to my doorbell but I can't find the origin (the transformer) anywhere, so I just let it be and it finally charged to 100% after 10 days. These solar panels charged my StickUp Battery Cameras in less than a day, so I'm really happy with the result.

153,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Ring Solar Panel for Spotlight Cam Battery,$39.99 - $91.94,5,"I own a lot of Ring gear, a mix of 6 versions of their cameras, camera/spotlights and doorbells and have owned some of my Ring gear for over 5 years. This was my first purchase of a battery powered Ring camera/light with the solar array accessory. I installed the set up the spring of 2021 - my impressions are below:

Pro:
-The solar array and Ring battery spotlight cam combo are conducive to an easier installation process than a wired Ring camera because you obviously don't need to install a 110v outlet or have proximity to one to make the installation.
-The 13 foot connection cord allows for a variety of installation scenarios. In my case, I ran the cable under my vinyl siding around a fireplace chase with the solar array on the sunny side and the camera facing my back yard.
-Inconspicuous appearance, does its job well. One important tip here - charge the battery to 100% BEFORE installation using the supplied USB cable and any USB power port. I bought an extra battery and it took me between 5 and 7 hours to charge each battery to 100% using the power cord. Do NOT rely on the solar panel to charge from 40% when the batteries arrive to 100%.
-The solar array has kept my pair of batteries at between 99%-100% since I hooked it up about 3 weeks ago. My solar panel is in a very sunny, unshaded spot and it gets between 8 and 12 hours of sun a day.

Con:
-More expensive than the wired version, especially with 2 batteries. But the ease of installation, not needing a 110V outlet and the long power cord decrease labor time and the power is off the grid.
- It's possible that many of the 1-2 star reviews for the solar array not working may be simple connection issues and not understanding how to set up the power draw the camera uses within the app.
-I think the solar array needs a LOT more sunlight than Ring claims which is 2 hours a day. I'd bet it's more like like 6-8+ hours of direct sun. Your results may vary depending on your location for the solar panel and the amount of sun it receives.

I saw a 1 star review that had the solar array mounted under and eave/soffit on a home. That's NOT going to work. The solar array needs full access to the sun so be thoughtful about the mounting location and under an eave is not a good choice for location.

You also may need to adjust the power usage settings on the app - it basically has a low, medium and high power draw set ups. Understand the app, the settings and choose the right settings for your situation.

Make sure you press the solar panel cable into the camera with enough pressure to fully seat the cord plug in the back of the camera. Then check ""solar status"" on the device health page (see photo). When I took the screen shot of the device health page I attached in the photos, it was raining outside and there was no solar charging going on - see the message from the app. If that ""connected"" note does not show up on the app, the array will not work properly. I have had the solar array cut out once since I installed it but got it quickly fixed.

I wiggled the solar cable a bit on the back of the camera and it immediately came back online on the device health page on the app. I removed the solar array cable from the back of the camera and put a small dab of dielectric compound on the metal cable end and reinserted the cable. Dielectric compound improves electrical connectivity, prevents metal oxidation and helps waterproof the electrical connection. The array has worked fine ever since I added the dielectric compound.

Your experience may vary based on location factors but based on my 5+ years of Ring experience and the performance of this particular solar camera package, I'd recommend this Ring solar array and camera without hesitation, especially where 110V outlets are not available or expensive to install AND you understand how to properly place the solar array and use the app settings.

We’re changing batteries about every three days. I have it set high for high recording times and wanted to try a solar charging system. I saw this on sale and gave it a try. Super easy to install and appears to charge the batteries with only a couple hours of direct sunlight. Great for the summer we’ll see how to do it has no winter.,positive
158,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Ring Solar Panel for Spotlight Cam Battery,$39.99 - $91.94,4,"I'll start with what's to love. The large solar panel works great. Even in winter when the days are short and mostly overcast, the panel collects enough sunlight to keep the Ring Spotlight fully charged. Mine has not dropped below 100% since I installed it, and that's with the single battery (not the optional second battery that you can add to the Spotlight camera). The power cable is long enough to give you flexibility where to place the panel relative to the Ring Spotlight camera.

Now to the design flaw, and this is potentially a biggie depending on where you want to install it. The mount only has a 2D swivel, meaning that you can pivot the panel up/down only in one direction. It desperately needs a 3D ball-type swivel so that you can pivot the panel in any direction (or at least a second 2D swivel so you can pivot the panel in two directions). The reason this is a big problem is that it severely restricts where you can affix the mount and tilt the panel toward the sun. In my case, I have my Spotlight camera mounted on a west-facing wall, and I need to mount my solar panel on either that same west wall or on the roof, which also slopes down toward the west. And since the sun rises in the east, that means that my solar panel is out of the sunlight for half the day unless I can also angle the panel slightly to the south. Since the mount has only a 2D swivel, I can only tilt the panel up/down facing directly to the west - it's not possible to tilt it up toward the sky AND slightly toward the south to maximize exposure to the sun's path. I could have mounted the panel on my roof, but that would require drilling holes through the shingles. Not only is drilling holes through shingles a great way to guarantee costly water damage and dry rot, it's also inherently unstable since you're mounting a relatively top heavy device through at least one and as many as three layers of shingle to get to the underlying plywood (or MDF, which is even more of a recipe for an unstable long term mounting). I ended up having to mount the panel just below my gutter, extending out (to the west) past the gutter and angled directly up, nearly flat like a table. Unfortunately, that means I get very little of the morning sun and am entirely dependent on capturing afternoon/evening sunlight. Luckily, the panel captures enough sunlight in the afternoon that it keeps the battery charged. However, if I had a Ring Spotlight camera on the north side of my house where my driveway and neighbor's house are, there is no way whatsoever that I could mount the panel in any place where it would capture enough sunlight to provide any charge to the Spotlight camera. It would be in the shade 100% of the time.

I would definitely give the panel 5-stars if it had the 3D swivel capability. Until then, it's great for mounting in a direct southern exposure. It's good for mounting in a western exposure, and presumably an eastern exposure as well. I question how well it would work mounted on a north-facing wall unless it was high enough that you could angle it flat or slightly to the south.",positive

Dislike that despite being only 24 feet from my Spectrum supplied WiFi wireless router, it often seems to have trouble connecting. Even thought it was replacing one that died, (after about 4 years), it took several hours with their help desk folks to get it working. It was not easy to replace an old one with another new one. I think it was easier to set up the very first one the first time.

It's response time renders it useless for seeing and talking to visitors and delivery people unless you have it set to automatically interrupt you with video every time someone shows up. When it only alerts you, it takes so long to get an alert that often they are long gone before you can even activate the live view. I often leave my house and get a block and a half away from my house before I get the alert. Sure you can wait a few minutes and see who was there in the history, but by then it's too late to talk to them or say something like get away from my car, or I'll call the police.

It's camera is much much wider angle view than my previous one, (I should have checked that out before buying), and I can't read a license plate from 10 feet away. With the previous one I could. This one is only good for identifying people I know and can already recognize easily. Rather useless for showing the police a picture of who is breaking into my care 15 feet away, even if they look at the camera.

161,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Ring Video Doorbell Wired,$51.99 - $91.98,5,"This is my review for:

Ring Video Doorbell Wired

I tried to keep my review short but there was a lot of information here so I added headers for easier reading.

Background:

When the first Ring doorbell came out, I really wanted one, but it was a bit too expensive for my taste, so I went with a cheap knock-off. I have been using that knock-off since then and I hate it. The image quality wasn’t awful, but it had a lot of bugs and it didn’t play well with “Alexa”. I kept automating my home adding echo’s, lights, switches, cameras, you name it and every time I circled back to the doorbell I would think: “I already have a video doorbell and the Ring doorbell is still pricey; maybe I should buy some other automation toys”. Well, this new Ring came out, and it was less than 100$ thus I said, let’s try it…

Appearance:

Dimensions wise, this one is pretty small (5.1”x2.4”x 1.1”). The button is very noticeably a button; to me this is important as with my old knock off doorbell, people would constantly push the camera lenses thinking that they rang the doorbell.

Differences between this Ring Doorbell and Previous versions:

I did some internet research prior to deciding for it, and I could only find a few things: (1) it supports only 2.4 GHz networks instead of being dual band, (2) it only works as a fully wired setup (3) it has a single faceplate and (4)it is way cheaper than previous models.

To me, it wasn’t a big deal the doorbell not being dual band, I planned on using the 2.4 GHz band anyway as I have been with my knockoff brand doorbell. There are several obstructions along the way (two thick walls and some furniture between the door and my repeater, and my router is in the basement), and the 2.4 GHz network is usually better for that albeit a bit slower.
This doorbell requires to have an existing wired doorbell setup, unlike previous iterations that you could have fully battery powered doorbell. Yet the setup is only needed for power. You will be bypassing the existing doorbell chime, thus, you will either need to purchase the model that include the Ring Chime (+20$), purchase a separate Ring Chime (30-50$) or use a compatible Alexa device as the speaker(s). I am using a few of my echoes and I like the setup a whole bunch.
The Ring Video Doorbell has a single face plate (black) vs 4 different color ones for the Pro. I did search online for other faceplates and I found a pearl white one going for about 15$ but I am sticking with the black one.
The newer model is about 70% cheaper. About 60$ vs the 200$ MSRP for the Pro.
Issues so far:

I haven’t had a lot of issues, but I already had one. I had some connectivity issues right of the bat. The fact that this doorbell bypasses the hardwired chime exacerbates this. No connectivity means no doorbell whether you have power or not. A few resets, I moved my repeater closer and it appear the problem was corrected. However, I point it out because when compared to my old 2.4 GHz knock-off video doorbell, I never had an issue. I am considering this as a one off but I will update my review if this issue persists.

Bottom line

What I liked:

Compatibility with Alexa. When Amazon acquired Ring a while back, I just knew that integration with Echo devices would probably only improve but even knowing that, I was impressed. You can define specific devices you want them to work with. It allows for tons of customization including ringtones.
I currently have two echo dots and an echo spot serving as my alerts and this setup works great. The video playback on the Echo Spot is smooth as silk with minimal Lag. I will be linking it up to my new Echo Show when it gets here, next week. I don’t envision any issues linking it up, but I will update my review if needed.
It features an advanced motion detection system that allows for customizable alert motion zones. It is extremely intuitive to setup. Thumbs up, all the way.
It was very easy to install
It looks elegant yet sleek.
It is cheaper than any previous Ring Model.

What I dislike so far.

It supports only 2.4 GHz networks. This is not a major negative as 2.4 GHz networks usually allow for a better range, especially if there are obstructions along the way. Still, it is worth mentioning.
I have a hardwired doorbell chime that is useless now. If my WIFI fails at any point, my doorbell is dead in the water.
I already had connectivity issues. They might have been a one off so I am not necessarily overreacting to them but I will update my review if needed.
The first two negatives were design choices that allowed lowering the price point and they were something I knew coming in. However, they are still significant enough that I called them out.

Overall, for the price, this is actually a very good device. If you already have a Ring doorbell, this item is not for you. If you don’t, and you are ok with a fully WIFI driven, hard wired power doorbell camera, I strongly recommend it.",positive

Already did the Ring Pro at front door so everything was setup jumper-wise and app-wise. Easy peasy.

Once installed I expected poor response and poor video quality. WRONG on both counts. Yes my Ring Pro is better and has more features like night color, but honestly not worth the price diff. At least not for me.",positive
163,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Ring Video Doorbell Wired,$51.99 - $91.98,4,"Easy to set up. Works fine. Center of picture is clear and focused. Edges of the picture are blurry.

Slightly disappointed that the picture quality is not as good as that of the ""Pro"" version. But then, this doorbell is about $100 less, too.

Even with a strong WiFi signal (-42 dBm), the delivery person is 25 ft and walking away when the app alerts that someone is at the door. However, the camera captures video of the person coming and going.

VERY IMPORTANT
Before buying this (or any other WiFi camera), use an app like Apple's AirPort Utility to verify that the location where you plan into install the device has a strong WiFi signal. Don't rely on the number of ""bars"".

The reason why you want a strong signal is that the heavy lifting is done in the cloud by Ring's AI product. For example, while motion is detected by the device, analysis of that motion is done in the cloud: person, vehicle, small animal, wind, etc. This in turn affects how quickly you get your notifications. Nearly all of the cameras within Ring's price ranges follow this division of processing scheme. (Google Nest camera performs video analysis on the device resulting in faster recordings and quicker notifications but the trade-off is higher battery drain.)

OTHER SYSTEMS IN USE
I use both a wired, non-Ring system (Blue Iris) and Ring cameras on my properties. The wired systems record locally to an NVR and are not internet connected. The Ring cameras are a backup in the event that the NVR goes missing.

As for the paid subscription, the price of $100 per year for each property is acceptable. It is less than the total cost of ownership of my wired system: hardware, software, electrical power.

I've used other WiFi cams but, without a paid subscription, every motion triggered an alert (cats, rabbits, blowing debris). And their apps were slow and not very intuitive.",positive
164,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Ring Video Doorbell Wired,$51.99 - $91.98,4,"Worked great out of the box - on a sunny afternoon. Captured motion in exactly the area I wanted, including the sidewalk in front of my house. But overnight, if the sun goes behind a cloud, or before the sidewalk is in full sun around mid-morning, the motion detection distance cuts to about half. WiFi signal has been consistent and sufficient. I bought this to monitor for nighttime vandalism of the fence along the sidewalk and for theft of hanging plants on my porch. It will do the latter but not the former. Also disappointed that you can’t use 2-way audio to converse with someone who rings the bell UNLESS you also set it to record the audio of every person passing by (and all the accompanying city noise). You should be able to override the audio privacy setting for someone who actually rings your bell. (You can speak to them, just not hear their response.) It does function as a decent video doorbell.

We also purchased a Chime to place in our basement where we spend most of out time. It set up super quick also. Thinking about another chime for the main floor since the old doorbell chime does not work with the Ring. But waiting to see if phone notifications will be enough.

170,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Stick Lite with Alexa Voice Remote Lite (no TV controls), HD streaming device",$19.99,4,"I have several Fire Sticks, Roku TVs, and a Roku Express. I don't have a need for 4K so that feature, found on the more expensive models, is not important to me. Price and basic performance are what counts. The new FireTV Stick Lite delivers--especially at the current promotional price.

All three of my basic Fire Sticks are standard models and identical in appearance with slightly different remote controls. The oldest standard stick has the most basic features and no volume or power button. The newer standard model has the same controls but with the addition of a power button, mute button and volume controls. The newest Lite model removes the power and sound buttons, but adds a guide button, not on the other two.

They removed the power and sound buttons on the Lite model. With these buttons, I pretty much don't have to use the TV remote control at all. For a few dollars more, you may want to consider the basic FireTV stick, just to get the power and sound buttons. Just make sure that you are getting a newer model with these features, and not the original stick without these buttons.

UPDATE 12/13/2020: I discovered that you CAN control the TV Power ON/OFF with the Fire Stick Lite if your TV is CEC capable (most are.) Pressing the HOME button on the Fire remote should turn the TV on and switch to the Fire input. If the TV is already on, pressing the HOME button will switch to the correct input. To turn the TV off, press the MIC button and say ""TV POWER OFF"" and it should turn the TV off. Make sure that your TV HDMI settings have CEC control turned on for this hidden feature to work. So far, I haven't been able to control the volume this way.

All of the remote controls use RF (radio frequencies) to control the stick, rather than the usual infra-red (IR) controls found on TV remotes. That means that they don't have to be pointed at the TV to work. In fact, they wouldn't work with the Fire Sticks if they were IR remotes since the Stick sits behind the TV. The downside to the RF remote is that they are specific to the individual stick. The menu allows you to pair a new remote to the Fire Stick if you replace one. You can also access the Fire Stick with your cell phone with the FireTV app. This has come in handy when I've misplaced the remote control, or worn down the battery and not had a replacement. By comparison, the Roku Express (and my Roku TVs) use IR remotes that you have to point. They are interchangeable, and the batteries seem to last longer than the RF remotes used with the Sticks.

Performance, picture quality and speed are good on all three Fire Stick models. The Lite model is the newest of the basic models and should have the fastest speed, but I haven't detected any difference. To save on network bandwidth, I force all of my devices to operate at 720P. The picture quality is quite good on my TVs (up to 50"") and pushing higher resolutions just wastes bandwidth, in my opinion. However, picture quality is heavily dependent on the particular app and type of content being watched, so I can't really make any predictions how it will work for you.

The FireTV Sticks plug directly into the HDMI connector on your TV. A short extension cable is provided if there is not enough space for the Stick to be plugged directly in. The unit is provided with a 5V 1.0 amp AC adapter and a short USB cable. Amazon recommends plugging the stick in to a separate outlet, rather than using the USB jack on many TVs. In fact, if the unit detects that the TV USB connector doesn't have enough amperage, you'll get a message telling you not to use it. It's more convenient to use the TV to power the Stick but there are drawbacks aside from the lack of power. The TV often turns off the USB connector when powered down, meaning that when you turn on the TV, the Fire Stick will have to reboot and reconnect to your network, slowing down your start-up. It would also be possible, in rare instances, to accidentally power down your stick with the TV when an upgrade is being performed, which could cause problems. All that said, I still use the Fire Stick with a smaller 24"" Vizio that I carry out to the patio, and power it with the TV's USB connector.

All of the FireTV Sticks have the ability to talk to Alexa by pressing the microphone button. Because they are directly linked to the FireTV stick, you can also tell it to search for and pull up apps. Before using the FireTV products, I was accustomed to selecting a search box and keying in what I was looking for. With the FireTV Sticks, I can press the mic button and say what app I'm looking for and install it. Or, I can tell it what program I am looking for and it may search and find it on YouTube, then start playing it. Neat feature and habit forming. The voice remote has many other features, like being able to answer my Ring doorbells, view my CloudCams, and other Alexa related skills. However, for most Alexa related activities, I usually have an Echo in the same room and use that, rather than the Fire Stick.

How does the FireTV Stick Lite compare with the Roku Express? Because they are similarly priced, you'd expect them to be very similar, but they are actually quite different. I've always liked Roku's and the Express is a very fast and capable unit. It doesn't hang from the HDMI connector, but instead connects with a short cable and sits under or on top of the TV, positioned so the remote's IR beam can control it. The Roku Express seems to respond faster, and with some apps, performs much faster. Again, that could be and app thing, and not the performance of the unit. With CEC compatible TVs, the Express is able to turn the TV power on and off with the basic remote. One BIG difference (and one that's hard to find in the literature) is that the FireTV Stick works on Wi-Fi at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The Roku Express only works at 2.4GHz. If your network is heavily dependent on 5GHz, the Roku Express won't be a good choice. Fortunately, in my situation I am able to use both.

Finally, with any smart TV adapter, make sure that you get one that will run the program apps that you want. They are mostly the same on the Roku and Fire devices but there are differences. For example, on the FireTV Stick, I can view my Amazon Photo library, including videos that I've shot with my cel phone. I can't do that (at present) with the Roku. You may find that the Roku has apps that are not available on the FireTV products. Ultimately, it's the apps that make these things work.",positive

This is actually better indexed than the apps themselves. There are movies missing in the apps, that if you search for them with Alexa you actually have them available to you for free. This is already happened a few times.

There are also a few decent games like Crossy Road. We're not sold on the idea of Alexa integration, or any AI, but we use the voice search all the time.

190,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,4,"Due to my answer in the QA section receiving many endorsement, i decided to give it a bit more detailed review after 2 weeks into owning the Blink setup. I came from Simplisafe, and i still do have simplisafe's alarm system, but due to their lack of outdoor camera solution, i finally decided to pull the trigger on the latest Outdoor blink and try out the Mini blink as well.

First thing's first, the new Outdoor Blink cam works mostly as advertised but the indoor Blink Mini is junk. Read more about the Mini below. But first the Outdoor (good)

Blink Outdoor:
Motion recording speed & Delay:
The Outdoor cam's trigger time is almost instant, in fact, I noticed that it even records a second before entering the frame. which tells me that it might be doing some kind of constant recording into the cam's onboard volatile memory as cache, and once motion is triggered it starts encoding the data and dumps it onto the cloud. So the trigger time is almost instant. However, note that there is a 5 second delay from what's happening Live vs what you see on your phone. so that delay is between Trigger --> Encode --> Cloud --> Decode. I""d imagine that if your Cam is connected to a wifi bridge as oppose to directly to the main router, the delay could be longer than 5 seconds. Compare to Simplisafe cam, the Live vs View delay is about the same. and the trigger time is about the same too.

Motion sensor & sensor distance.
the motion sensor distance in the Outdoor cam is less than 25 ft. despite what the feature ad would tell you. i have 4 Cams (3 outdoor setup at an angle pointing down 45 degree angle, and 1 in the garage looking pretty much straight flat at my car), 3 of the outdoor ones could pretty much trigger 15~20ft out, while the one in the garage struggles to even trigger at 15 ft. You should also take night vision into account. in NV mode, the distance is 5ft shorter. increasing the IR blast in NV will somewhat mitigate the problem but at a cost of battery drain. i tried moving the cam in garage from pointing 45 degree down to looking almost straight horizontal to improve motion sensing to a degree. So if you have trouble with the motion sensor, try that. Compare to Simplisafe's cam, the Simplicam seems to have farther motion sensing distance. But then again, Simplisafe still doesn't have an outdoor solution.

Speaker/Mic
the speaker and Mic quality is really good. it doesn't sound overly tiny like you would expect and is loud and clear. compare to Simplicam, the Blink Outdoor has better sound and mic.

Wifi Wireless
i was surprised how well the wireless works. lots of complains in the review about wireless distance, not sure if they're genuine. but my farthest cam is about 80ft away from my main router thought a living room, a dining room and a garage and garage door (just shy of the max 100ft advertised in the spec), i am still able to get above 33% wifi N signal. But i think a lot of this ""might"" depend on the quality of your Wifi router. i spared no expense on my home wifi. So my router is 3x3 beam forming top of the line AC router that also has a very wide 802.11 N coverage. it can reach far and carry lots of bandwidth. my advice is invest in a quality wifi router with the most bandwidth and range you can afford. Note that the cams and module only supports 802.11 N. Compare to Simplicam, the wifi signal reach is about the same, if not slightly better than the Simplicam.

AC Wireless.
part of the charm and strength about the Blink Outdoor is its battery powered wireless nature. Only time will tell how long my Cams will last. I will update this review and reflect the score once my first set of battery run out. My gut tells me it'll be less than 2 years, well less. but i'd be happy if i can get even 1 year out of those cams. Note that the advertised 2 year battery life from Amazon is based on roughly 2 mins of video footage per day per cam. One of my busiest cam facing out the front door is seeing 2~3 times that amount.

Resolution/video quality
the resolution of the cam and video compression is really good. compare to those legacy 480p outdoor cams, this was a big step up. but compare to the simplicam, i would say the image looks slightly sharper than the Simplicam. but note that true 1080p resolution is only possible with high quality video record setting, which can chew up your battery and storage. Amazon's 2 year battery life is based on medium setting, which is actually 720p. but even at the medium setting, i still find the image to be very sharp and clear. going from medium to high (1080p) setting yield ""some"" improvement viewing on a smart phone. you likely won't be able to find big difference viewing it on a smartphone unless you view both videos on a large monitor. oh which btw, currently there's no app available for desktop computers. you'll have to either download the footage or pull the backup off your thumb drive to view it on a dekstop.

Storage
ok, this is the most contentious and messed up part. the ad made you believe that you don't need to subscribe to cloud and able to store locally. what they don't explain to you is that local storage is only a secondary option on top of the cloud subscription. so you CANNOT, at least at the point of this review, store your recordings directly to the USB thumb drive and read off of it directly. how the Blink cam works right now is everything gets dumped to their cloud server, and when you view the footage, it reads off their cloud server. the USB thumb drive is just there to backup ""from their cloud server"" ""once a day"". there is no way for you to have the cams upload recordings directly to the thumb drive locally and view them from your phone wirelessly off the USB Thumbdrive. There're a lot of people asking about this question on forums and, like me, only found this out after the fact. It's not a deal breaker, but it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Why not just come out and say it. It's simply misleading. if you go to their website, and dig, and i mean really dig, you'll find that there is a way to run it without subscription. but any motion trigger or live views will not be recorded. So what's the point of local storage? it's almost like they just want to find a way to cramp that ""local storage"" wording into their ad to sell you the product only to find out that it's a secondary backup on top of a pay subscription.

Now onto Blink mini (junk)

Blink mini on the other hand. To put it simply is junk or an opportunity wasted. the Blink Mini has a long standing bug that plagued the camera for at least 2 years, and the dev team still hasn't released a fix. The issue with Blink Mini is that it fails to trigger motion recording coming out of night vision mode when you enter the room to turn the lights on. the dev team explained that something to do with the cam goes into freeze mode when it attempts to wake itself out of night vision to do recording. for that reason, it's pretty much trash if you intend on using the Mini as any kind of indoor security cam. I originally intended to use the Mini in my garage to monitor my prized stallion. But i literately would go into my garage and walk up to the car and no motion or recording is triggered. Dev has acknowledged this issue since late 2018 and said in 2019 forum post that firmware update is coming to fix this. it is now end of 2020, i would not count on it. The only reason i kept my Mini and ordered another Outdoor cam for the garage is so that in any case when we go on vacation, i can set the Mini up in the living room to do live view. But if you're thinking about getting the Mini for motion triggered security cam indoor, forget it. don't say i didn't warn you.

Software UI/UX
the interface for the app is easy to use and more organized than many other similar services. clips are organized with usable filters at your disposal. the motion sensing manual dead zone configuration is helpful, although likely not too useful if you're using it outdoor, since the ""motion sensor"" distance (not wifi distance) is well shy of advertised 25ft.

OVERALL
the new Outdoor blink has a lot going for it. If they can fix their advertisement wording, or better, let us have the option to record directly to the USB Thumb drive and be able to view the recording from our devices directly from the thumbdrive. it'll then be a True local storage solution. the only reason i ditched my Simplicam is because i really wanted to have smart Cams covering my house outdoor. Been 3+ years since Simplisafe said that they would come out with an outdoor solution. But till this day, still nothing. i just got tired of waiting. When i saw the new Blink Outdoor being advertised for Black Friday, i really wanted to give it a try. i would say the barrier to entry is minimal. the Blink hardware given the discount that amazon has been giving out, is worth the shot. Without the deep discounts, i am not so sure. They just need to improve the motion sensor distance coverage, and let us really use the USB thumb drive for storage. In a sea of smart home security market today. Amazon really needs to do more to win over customers and not only that, to keep them there. If they can combine Ring with Blink, i might just ditch my Simplisafe completely and go Ring to combine their alarm system with Blink. If they can do that, i don't mind paying the $10/month subscription. But at its current state, they still have work to do to win over customers.

i will update the review on the battery life",positive
191,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,3,"Empecemos por decir que lo que ofrece el producto es lo que vas a obtener ni mas ni menos.

El producto es totalmente inalámbrico , lo que le da ventajas a la hora de una instalación limpia rápida y sin cables a simple vista.

La conexión vía remota desde el celular a través de app es genial y muy fluida, cuando quieres ver los videos, aunque la conexión con mi dispositivo echo show 5 a sido casi imposible para el control de voz y para la visión en vivo tiene un delay bastante desagradable.

La duración de las baterías es excelente tengo 5 camaras instaladas y una de ellas esta en la entrada del conjunto residencial, lo que hace que diariamente este por las 70 notificaciones de movimiento promedio con sus respectivos videos y aun después de un mes dice que esta sobre el 70% de vida.

Las notificaciones son casi que en tiempo real max unos 10 a 15 seg después de la detección de movimiento llega la notificación a la app de celular, pero la conexión con alexa en mi caso a sido terrible y bastante deprimente porque me decidí por el producto justo por esa función y no he podido darle solución a los errores constantes entre alexa y el skill de blink.

Ahora indaguemos mas en lo tecnico y por lo cual me ha decepcionado un poco el sistema.

Este no es un sistema de vigilancia de video es mas en mi opinión un sistema de alarma de movimiento con capacidad de grabar el evento que activo la señal de alarma, aunque muchas veces ese video termina por frustrarte mas y a continuación explico el porque

El sistema solo puede grabar entre 5 seg y 60 seg de grabación y aunque a veces 60seg es mucho tiempo, tiene una opción que permite parar el video antes si el movimiento se detiene, pero aca es donde comienza el problema en realidad, si activas esta opción, el sistema tiene una contra que la camara al desactivarse tarda 10 seg en volver a estar lista para registrar otra alerta lo cual hace que a veces pierdas información valiosa en cuanto a seguridad, si el movimiento para y luego se reactiva mientras la camara esta en el reposo de los 10seg, la camara no registrara nada en video y si el intruso sale fuera del rango de detección ya no podrás saber que paso luego, incluso si el movimiento llegar a seguir después de los 60seg max de grabación por alerta, la camara entraría en ese mismo tiempo de descanso de 10seg.

Aunque las alertas en la app son muy rápidas este Tiempo se puede ver afectado si la opción de alertas rápidas no esta activada, ya que esta viene desactivada por defecto y si no se activa en cada camara puedes tener unas que te avisen y otras que las notificaciones llegue siempre tarde o después que ya se detecto el movimiento.

En resumen si lo que quieres es un sistema de alerta de movimiento o cercanía este es el sistema que debería comprar pero si quieres un sistema de vigilancia de video busca otras opciones.

Dentro de amazon hay varias opciones de camara ptz wifi con grabación continua, detección de movimiento, alarma sonora y audio doble vía que trabaja muy similar a este sistema y con una memoria de 32gb tienes hasta 4 dias de grabación continua y son mas económicos, aunque no son tan excelentes como este en visión de video en vivo o revisando archivos de alarma te serán mas útiles si lo que buscas es un sistema cctv, por lo menos en mi opinión.

Postdata aun no se como funciona el sistema sin la membresía a Blink plus aun estoy dentro de la prueba gratis y aunque ya tengo todo el sistema para grabación local pronto volveré con mi opinión de como se porta el sistema una ves no tengas el soporte de Blink Plus.

--------------------------------------------------------

Let's start by saying that what the product offers is what you are going to get, no more, no less.

The product is completely wireless, giving you the advantage of a quick clean installation without wires at a glance.

The remote connection from the cell phone through the app is great and very fluid, when you want to watch the videos, although the connection with my echo show 5 device has been almost impossible for voice control and for live viewing it has a delay quite unpleasant.

The duration of the batteries is excellent, I have 5 cameras installed and one of them is at the entrance of the residential complex, which means that every day there are 70 average movement notifications with their respective videos and even after a month it says that it is over 70% life batteries.

Notifications are almost in real time, max about 10 to 15 seconds after motion detection, the notification arrives on the mobile app, but the connection with alexa in my case has been terrible and quite depressing because I decided on the right product for that function and I have not been able to solve the constant errors between alexa and the blink skill.

Now let's dig deeper into the technical and for which the system has disappointed me a bit.

This is not a video surveillance system, it is more in my opinion a motion alarm system with the ability to record the event that activated the alarm signal, although many times that video ends up frustrating you more and I will explain why below.

The system can only record between 5sec and 60sec of recording and although sometimes 60sec is a long time, it has an option that allows you to stop the video earlier if the movement stops, but this is where the problem really starts, if you activate this option, the system has a counter that when the camera is deactivated, it takes 10 seconds to be ready again to record another alert, which sometimes means that you lose valuable information regarding security, if the movement stops and then reactivates while the camera is At rest for 10 seconds, the camera will not record anything on video and if the intruder goes out of the detection range, you will no longer be able to know what happened next, even if the movement continues after the maximum 60 seconds of recording by alert, the camera would enter that same rest time of 10sec.

Although the alerts in the app are very fast, this Time can be affected if the quick alerts option is not activated, since it is deactivated by default and if it is not activated in each camera you can have some that notify you and others that Notifications always arrive late or after motion has already been detected.

No me In short, if what you want is a movement or proximity alert system, this is the system you should buy, but if you want a video surveillance system, look for other options.

Within amazon there are several wifi ptz camera options with continuous recording, motion detection, sound alarm and two-way audio and lights that works very similar to this system and with a 32gb memory you have up to 4 days of continuous recording and they are cheaper, although They are not as excellent as this one in viewing live video or reviewing alarm files. They will be more useful if you are looking for a cctv system, at least in my opinion. Postscript I still don't know how the system works without Blink plus membership I'm still in the free trial and although I already have the entire system for local recording I'll soon come back with my opinion on how the system behaves once you don't have Blink support Plus.",fair
192,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,1,"REVIEW UPDATE

We recently lost our internet connection due to updates our ISP had to make. What we didn't know is that Blink cameras are solely dependent on an Internet connection (not just a wifi connection) even if you don't have a subscription or just have the trial. None of the outdoor cameras will remain active when you lose Internet connectivity. My wrongful assumption was that ONLY your local area network was needed since it relies on a wifi signal. Nope. That is wrong. The Sync Modules will flash the green LED and no camera will work. Great job Blink/Amazon for putting customers at risk to thieves and other criminals.

We have 4 of the outdoor cameras on two separate Sync2 Modules due to the distance from the main router. We have an extender (set as a repeater) which handles the furthest cameras. As I said I never considered these would go offline if the Internet connection went down. I figured if my LAN went down then it would make total sense the cameras would go offline, yet I was foolish in my thinking.

Again this is shameful of Blink/Amazon to have this even as a feature. I get that you need an account to pay for the service, but why in the world would these be designed to FAIL if your Internet connection goes down?

It is not only misleading to consumers to not EXPLICITLY state that these cameras will fail to operate without an Internet connection.

This IS one of the WORST investments my family ever made in a product. Would have been better to purchase a CCTV camera system and just hardwired everything on the network. For what we've now paid for 4 cameras + the sales tax we could have gotten a 4 camera CCTV setup instead from a local box store.

As I have said in my original review, the cameras do work, and will suffice. Keep in mind that an Internet connection is REQUIRED and not just your local area network connection. I had to lower my rating to just one star because nothing is lower than that on Amazon's site. I'd give this camera system negative stars it it were possible just based on our experience over the past few months.

Also I think I was far too generous with parts of my original review, but experience will change your mind when the experience becomes bad.

I no will longer recommend ANY of the Blink cameras. Until they are no longer dependent on an Internet connection and will fully function on just your local networks wifi signal. I will be researching a true CCTV camera system to replace the Blink cameras. If I could get a refund I'd do it in a heartbeat, but that window has closed. The price of this education is high!

---------
Original review

Recently purchased the Blink Outdoor 2 Camera system, and it's a very hit or miss system. I have several things to say about the security cameras and the Blink app that goes with it.

The base:

The friction fit mounting bases are not easy to snap into place. I had to use a long and think flat headed screw driver to aid in connecting it. Also I worried about crushing the sensor on the camera because of how much force it takes and where my hands are pressing on the camera itself (holding from the edges while mounting under a roof eave is moderately annoying). Once it is finally snapped to the base it moves freely and the camera stays in place.

The Sync 2 Module

This is the brains of the system. Each module controls up to 10 cameras and utilizes your 2.4GHz Wifi connection. Now I mistakenly assumed that my 2 camera system didn't include the Sync 2 Module (I didn't notices a ""what's in the box"" on Blinks Amazon page. So I ended up buying one which was a waste of money considering it's included. The setup takes a while after you power it on you'll need the app to discover the device. Initially the blue LED flashes and the green LED is steady. Once it is discovered then then both LEDs are steady.

The app (Android)

At first the app to control this camera system seems simple, but there are some annoyances I've discovered. The system will NOT discover the best WiFi connection on your network. I have an detached garage with the camera approximately 75 feet from the Sync 2 Module, and my router is close to 10 feet from the Sync 2 Module. So I picked up a WiFi extender and set it as a Repeater (firewall, DNS, DHCP etc. is controlled by my primary router) in order for the signal strength to be at a maximum. It is recommended that you use the existing WiFi names (SSIDs) on your network (for 2.4GHz only) and append _EXT so Blink can see it if using a Wifi extender. Also keep your password keys for your wifi extender the exact same that are on your main wifi router. Now in theory (and based on Blink's own guidelines) the system should pick the best Wifi signal based on your setup. Well it doesn't, and there is NO option in the Blink app for me to place my garage camera on the extender Wifi (again it's on the same network as all my devices are) while keeping the door camera on the primary router (same network once again). This is not about changing networks, this is about discovering the extender on my main network (which I repeat Blink claims it will chose the best signal automatically). Yes I could add the second Sync 2 Module in the garage, but then I'd have to create a second system for the garage camera. Not entirely what you should have to do.

Batteries: These cameras require the more expensive Lithium AAs you do get the batteries with the cameras (mine were Energizer Lithium AAs. The cameras are equipped with a USB B mini connection which you can use to connect to a powered USB source as to not run off batteries. In my case I picked up a motion detector LED flood light that offers a USB connection (this unit https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08F9CNPVW). I would remove the batteries from the cameras because I do not know if connected will it try to charge the batteries (these are NON chargeable lithium batteries) or it will it bypass the batteries? I would err on the side of caution and remove them.

Local Storage (USB thumb drive) vs Blink Subscriptions

This is an Amazon product and you'd think that the Blink camera systems would provide free service to Amazon Prime members. Nope. You are nickled and dimed on a per camera basis at $6 monthly, and it's $100 annually (if I read it right) for one full system). Again why is this NOT part of Prime Membership?

So to avoid saving to the cloud I bought a 256GB thumb drive to insert into the Sync 2 Module. What I have discovered is ONLY clips are saved locally. You are NOT able to save live recordings to the local storage. Really? Why? What's the point of only having the clips (maxed at 60 seconds) on a local drive? To me this is a rip off and not mentioned anywhere in the product details.

Yes you do get a ""free"" trial which unlocks all features. If you; however, cancel that trial early or let it expire without buying a subscription than certain features are locked. So again you pay a lot for the camera system and you are locked out of many features IF you don't buy their subscription to the cloud. Talk about ripping folks off. Sure you can look at live feeds, but you can't same them locally. You can take a snapshot from the cameras, but it will NOT take a photo every hour UNLESS you BUY a Blink subscription. Again this all goes back to Blink subscriptions. Tell me what's the point of local storage if all you can save are clips?

Loading issues with clips and thumbnails. So I've run into issues where loading a clip from the connected USB drive fails to load 95% of the time. Again these are short clips and should pull faster than from the Cloud. Nope. Thumbnails are hit or miss. These are generated when you press the camera icon on the home screen of the app. I call them snaps, but I've noticed if I am sitting near the Sync 2 Module it can still fail. Full wifi bars too and it still fails.

Alexa:

It is claimed by Blink that the newest generation of their cameras will work with Alexa. I used the app from my phone, but she can't do anything with the cameras (even when trained to use them). In this case you may have to buy an Alexa enabled device (like Show). You technically don't need one they are NOT required for these cameras, but the Alexa app alone on a smartphone is limited.

Finally the recommend having minimum Internet speeds of 2Mb up and down for these cameras, but I believe that is ONLY if you are saving and storing to the cloud along with accessing from the cloud. Locally your access to the Blink cameras will depend on your network speeds along with wifi. The more stuff you have connected the slower it can be.

Conclusion. The Blink Camera System isn't terrible, and they are affordable. There are quirks as I mentioned and annoyances I have dealt with. These are not high end systems but on a tight budget you can get a good start.",negative
193,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,1," FINAL UPDATE: What was once pretty cool and recommended is now completely useless. If you don't subscribe they take away features and the entire system no longer works right.. They want you to pay every month.. $10/month that's $120 a year.. They also want you to link your Amazon account. Make sure to read the fine print.. Blink wants your Amazon data.. I've spent over $2,000 on these cameras.. Now all of it is useless.. Short clips blurred images glitches all the time deleted clips reappear sometimes it doesn't even record no live view saves, sensors don't pick up anything audio goes out, it all turned to trash. They want to blame it on your wifi. 🙄 They are throttling controlling how well your cameras work.. I feel so betrayed and swindled. I've been recommending these cameras even set my parents up told friends now it's all a waste because Blink wants to be shady.. VERY DISAPPOINTING DO NOT REWARD COMPANIES LIKE THIS WITH YOUR MONEY. 👎🤨

UPDATE: 4/28/21 - 8 or so months in. I have purchased 17 of these cameras and 3 sync modules and planned on buying more also purchased many accessories. Different mounting brackets for the cameras and modules wifi extenders larger battery packs etc. They all worked great at first then slowly came the problems. I put up with the failed views the super short recordings that happened now n then the modules going offline repeatedly no its not my internet the glitches etc ... Now something about a PLUS PLAN suddenly pops up on my app. You can no longer save live clips. 😡 One of the cool things was being able to watch something live then being able to save it. You cannot do that simple little thing anymore.

The cloud storage wasn't that big of a deal since you could pop in a thumbdrive to save recordings. Now they want to charge you for the ability to save live views onto your thumbdrive. It was cool and convenient the ability to view something live catch something happening which is the whole point of a camera then saving it. Now if you catch something happening live its useless because you can't save it. 😡 The system has to be armed and you have to hope the sensors pick it up and even then it may not even reset. They ruined the playback on the app now. No thumbnails and if you want to delete you have to delete clips separately no select all option. This is NOT WORTH BUYING anymore. For the amount of money I spent I should be able to save a short live view. I could have purchased a nicer security system for the money I spent. I no longer recommend this system as they want to charge you a monthly fee for a simple feature a doorbell cam can do. At bare minimum they should not charge Prime Members a subscription fee. Very disappointing that they change the functionality so they can charge you for it. My original review and updates are below.
👇😕

This is pretty close to a must have they just need to make some tweaks. 🤙 Picture quality is pretty good. It has a nice dynamic range. The POV is pretty good. Its plenty wide and a little fisheye. For the most part pretty clear. 👍

The audio is fairly decent but you get a lot of humming and hissing. The microphone where you can talk to someone is fairly decent. You're talking about close distance about average distance of someone at your front door.

The setup is pretty easy just install the app and follow the instructions. Let it update the firmware. One tip when you get to the cameras leave the back off because you will have to scan the QR code.

So why not 5 stars since this is pretty cool? The back where you put the batteries screws on and off with a wonky tool they give you. It would be fine if it was a twist lock not an actual screw. The price is kinda steep. I needed 4 cameras. 4 sides to a house or building right? They don't have a 4 camera bundle. 3 or jump to 5. I purchased another single camera because it was only $10 more with a sync module than a add on camera.

Not much security for the camera itself. It just pops off. Anyone can steal it. The camera mount has a limited angle. Its basically made for a straight flat install. I bought separate swivel mounts so I can mount it to the underside of my roof on the side of my house and place the camera looking down the side of my house. They should upgrade the mount. You can always mount the camera higher to avoid theft but sometimes that's limited.

After awhile there's inconsistencies short clip recordings failed views no restart recordings after the pause and the longest you can record is 30 seconds and it won't fully record the full 30 secs. Audio cuts out or doesn't record at all and lots of freezes. 😐

This is a pretty good simple to set up and use camera system. The night vision and motion detection are pretty decent. They should have kept the free cloud storage but i prefer the separate thumbdrive storage. Less chances of hacking being all over the interweb. Using a thumbdrive is not a problem. Maybe they should include one. There's a slight delay in the live shot. Hear something and you wanna click live view you wait a few seconds and by that time the action is gone. They need to make that faster. As for getting notifications instantly when the motion detection is triggered its not bad but there's a delay there too. And it does not recognize or connect to my 5G only to 2.4G on my wifi. 😐 Like I said its pretty decent but could use some improvements and am sure they will continue to do so but for now for what I'm using it for as simple security and being able to monitor my house and yes I can be away and monitor my house from afar yeah definitely worth getting. 👍

UPDATE: Its been a month and a half and the batteries are still good. I do notice not as much hissing and screeching noise. Don't know if that means battery life is going down and the mic is less powered or what but everything still works pretty good. Picked up several of the mini cams as well on sale. Great for inside and the garage. Had one on the patio but it got a little moisture slime. Didn't affect the camera though but I did move it in.

Had one hick up. It said view failed or something like that once and I couldn't get a live view. I just took a photo and it seemed to clear that up. I see a lot of people showing that in the reviews so thought that would help.

I also see a lot of reviews posting pics of bad night vision. You need to reposition your camera. You either have something below it or above it too close to the lens. For example if you have it mounted under an awning and you get a dark picture or you get a foggy looking halo ring you need to bring the camera out further so there is not much covering the top or bottom. The sides are also affected but not as much.

Move it around remember camera position is key for good night vision. Even though it's made for the outdoors you don't want it in direct sunlight where the unit will go passed the 110deg limit. That will kill battery performance and camera capabilities. Hope that helps some of you with those issues. I will update again on battery life. So far its near Thanksgiving and batteries are good. I arm it at night 100% of the time. During the day a little less. I've captured several delivery personnel a raccoon a couple of cats sun glare off my pool some dust looking particles that look like spirits flying away 😄 and of course myself when I forget to disarm 😃 and the battery indicator says OK. They really need a percentage indicator on that. I live view several times a day but only for a few seconds if there's nothing going on.

The cloud thing is not a big deal at all. Get a thumbdrive and you're good to go. All your clips are saved on that instead of the cloud. I love the easy sharing too. I will text my friends with a short clip I can upload straight to my YouTube channel. Its pretty cool. One thing I would like to see is a shorter break between clips. You can miss a lot in 10 seconds. And a longer recording capability than 30sec especially with motion. I know that can eat battery life but they can improve there as well.🖖😉👍

UPDATE 2: I'm getting more failed to connect to cloud indications and I'm not using the cloud I'm using a thumbdrive. I'm also getting more false recordings. Nothing is happening and it will record a clip. Also a live view will pop up in the recorded clip segment. 🤔 Its starting to be a little fidgety but not to the point it upsets me.

UPDATE 3: One of the cameras needed a reset. Pop the batteries out then pop em back in. 🤔 It said failed view or not available something like that. Battery life is going on 3 months with moderate use. What's moderate use? I arm every night and 3 - 5 times a day. Take photos 2 - 3 times and watch live view 4 - 5 times a day. Each live view is for one cycle before it times out or asks to continue. Sometimes I'll watch live view for 3 - 4 times continued. Still haven't needed to replace batteries yet. 👍

Update 4: Colder weather is here and another camera needed a reset where you pop the batteries out wait 30secs and pop em back in. Battery still says ok and its going on 3 and a 1/2 months. It first gave me a failed to load warning here n there and that may be a sign you may need to do a reset.

Update 5: The inconsistencies have increased greatly. The syn module continually goes offline requiring a wifi reboot. The batteries are still good and it's been 6 months. There are more freezes and jumps in recordings.",negative
194,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,4,"I must preface this review by telling all that I am a mechanical klutz but semi-tech savvy. I should also advise that I only received and assembled this product a few hours ago so I will certainly learn more as time passes and I will amend this review accordingly. Having said that, there are a few things that I should mention for the benefit of all other klutz's out there. The first thing I noticed is that there are no detailed instructions! Everyone noted in Amazon revewes how easy installation was so I wasn't all that concerned when placing my order. I should have been. Inexcusable that there were no instructions. I resorted to going to You Tube and found a couple of videos that were very helpful. But even with the videos, I had some very simple but troubling issues. I am after all a klutz.

The first step in installation is to download the Blink app. Much to my surprise, the free Blink app is not compatible with a desktop PC Windows computer. It is primarily an Android app so I was compelled to download the app to my Android phone. Now I realize that most would not have an issue doing that but I wish I had known that because I prefer to control my surveillance systems on my PC. I suspect there may be 3rd party companies that offer Blink compatible software for PC's but again, I wish I had known beforehand. I am still investigating and will likely find a solution to use the app on my PC but for now, can only use compatible devices.

The cameras and the module are all wrapped in a thin and almost invisible plastic wrap. One of the first steps is to install the provided 2 Lithium AA batteries in the rear of each of the cameras. I finally figured out how to get the back plate/cover off the camera and it was a little frustrating. First, you should know that there is a rubber plug that covers the screw which holds the back plate. You need to take that plug out to access the screw. The kit provided a plastic key that fits into the screw and can be used to unscrew the screw. Simple right? Well, I turned and turned and turned the screw but the back plate would not come off. I finally figured out that there was a very thin and invisible plastic that wrapped around the edges of the camera body and that it had to be removed because it otherwise prevented the back plate from releasing once it was unscrewed. Yes, you have to have had eagle eyes to have seen that plastic film and it was a little tricky getting it off. (I warned you that I was a klutz.) Ok, so now that I removed the plastic, I found a notch in the back plate to help lift it out of the camera body. That now revealed the slots where to install the batteries and the slots were adequately marked to show polarity positions. But after you install the batteries - do not screw the cover back on. Why? Because you need to access the camera ID serial numbers. Again, I had to find this out on my own because there were no instructions! Also know that once you do screw the back plate back on, it should be orientated properly and there is only one way that will happen even though the cover will go on any way. The easiest way to orient the plate correctly is to ensure that the USB C port opening lines up with the USB C port on the camera.

Synching the module and each of the cameras was relatively easy so I won't belabor these steps. The You Tube videos were very helpful to get through these steps. But here's another setup klutz problem I came across. To mount the cameras, there are mounting bases that attach to the back of the camera body by snapping into that area where the screw is located. Sounds easy enough but it is a little tricky. First, understand that the mounts need to be screwed into whatever house structure your attaching the camera to. But the holes in the mount are situated in such a manner that it is impossible to access the holes once the camera is attached. So you need to first screw the mount on to the wall before attaching the camera. The only problem with that is you now have to snap the camera on to the mount and as I mentioned above, that was a little difficult.

OK, now that I had the cameras set up, figuring out how to work the system was another stumbling block. Again - no guidance because no instructions. Even being a little tech savvy, I had some difficulty. I found that the software was not as user friendly as I would have expected. OK, I am still playing with the system and learning but once again, it sure would help having instructions.",positive
195,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,5,"When we first purchased cams back in 2017, we compared to Arlo and Ring before we chose Blink. Now we are up to 10 cams, covering every angle of the house. Here are my findings after using them for almost 4 years (and still buying more):
PROS:
> #1 video quality is excellent. Day time is a bit better than night, but night vision is as good as it gets with cams. POSITION of your cam matters a ton. I started out putting them way high up and quickly realized - if you actually want identifying features - they need to be lower. Otherwise... yeah you see someone walking past, but you cant ID anything, so what is the use.
> So inexpensive - so easy to integrate. Anytime we have ANYTHING we need to cover, we just order another cam and it literally takes 5 minutes to get it out of the box, batteries in, and added to existing system.. seriously - 5 minutes.
> The app is great. Very intuitive. Our first cams had very few ""advanced features"" every time i order new cams, they have improved their features. Now you are able to zoom all the way in to very small areas, to capture certain areas and exclude others.. For example - old cams you had to block off large sections of the capture area to avoid the cams picking up movement from trees, but now you can pinpoint one little part of a branch on a tree to exclude if its triggering the cam.
> Motion detection is very sensitive - but they have it tweaked just about right. It never misses anything, but if you setup your exclusion zones well - you can get it almost perfect. I dont have a lot of false alarms and I'm running 10 cams. We have one setup to look at the sidewak, and after much tweaking, we can actually exclude the street... but pick up both sidewalks on both sides of the street. You can setup the app to alert you or not alert you.. you can turn sound on or off on alerts. On windy days I do end up just going into the app and turning off all cams that are setup around lots of trees until the storm is over.. but thats like a few times a year.
> Super easy playback and control of cams. It's instant - you can control them in any way, very easily. If I am working on a project in the yard, I dont want my cams on for hours, running out of batteries - so I just go into the app and turn them all off. It takes seconds. Likewise - if i hear a noise at night, super easy to open the app and live view any cam so i can look all around the house and see everything happening outside, from every angle.
> Extremely easy to move around. We have had them for years - so we move them around occasionally. I even had mice in our crawlspace under the house at one point and just grabbed one of the cams off the side of the house and stuck it down there so I could catch them at night. Theres no commitment with these - no hard wiring so you can mount them anywhere and taking them on and off the mount takes 2 seconds.
> No subscription needed to store clips. thats BIG for us. We would not like blink as much if they changed that. We run a lot of cams and it just stays 100% full storage - we can still access a few weeks worth of video, it just deletes oldest. You can download/save any videos.
> Lots of mounting options. You have to buy them separately if you want anything special, but I have 3 different types of mounts - one for trees, one around porches that need to be secured so they cant be taken, and then the standard mounts for cams not at risk of being taken. There are camo skins as well - I have on in a tree that you pretty much cant see unless you know its there.
> Customer support is super decent. In the winter of 2018, one of my cams took on a green hue to the image when the temp went down to about 10 degrees outside. I emailed customer service explaining the issue and sent a screenshot and within 24 hours they asked me for the SN of the cam, and did a firmware update that fixed it. I was quite happy with that.
CONS:
> So while the batteries are awesome because the cams are so easy to move around and deal with... i blow through batteries. Fortunately, i just get 20 packs of AA's, but with 10 cams - even though Blink ~says~ batteries can last a year? it totally depends on usage. So we get LOTS of traffic on our front cams because we live in a busy area and have people walking past all day. I change out the batteries on every one of those front cams once a month. Granted - thats many hundreds of video captures and ideally, we should connect those cams to electricity somehow - that is an option with blink, but I dont mind changing batteries. On the cams in the back yard and side paths - I really can go once or twice a year changing those, except for the ones that catch a lot of foot traffic. So the battery usage is totally dependent on traffic. Personally - the cams are a big deal to me, so i dont mind it at all. Benefits totally outweigh the downsides.
> The biggest difference between Blink and some other companies is that i see other people with hardwired cams that can catch EVERYTHING in a continuous fashion, for hours. like the surveillance videos you see online where the cam just happened to catch something happening down the street...Blink doesnt work that way. it only captures immediate video clips, triggered by motion activation. It does store all videos.. you can see something weird in your yard and look back through videos to find out what happened - but it isnt 24 hours of continuous video feed.
> You can get gaps in your videos. So it can capture 1 minute of video at a time, but then it takes a small break before it starts capturing again, so if something is happening and its videotaping an event - it will record an entire minute of excellent footage - but then it takes a 5 second break before it starts recording again. that doesnt sound like a long time, and for security it's not normally an issue.. the average bad guy is in and out quickly.. but it is annoying that it takes 5 seconds to re-trigger. So.... 2 minutes of continuous video... but in the middle of that 2 minutes.. a 5 second break.
OVERALL - Super high video quality... cams you can move around super easily... a very easy app... I love blink and the upsides far outweigh any downsides. I always recommend it to people when they ask. You can cover your entire house at a super affordable price, you dont need to be rich at all.. Our 3 year old cams are still as good as our brand new ones. The peace of mind the cams bring me is priceless. I know every single thing happening everywhere, all the time outside. The affordability made it possible so that nothing can ever surprise us.",positive
196,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,5," We've got some bad actors in the hood, so it was time to catch them with some irrefutable evidence. Our XT2 is a little old and our Arlos are acting stupid. Saw this come out and had to give it a shot. It was time to upgrade. Plus, the specs of the possibility of TWO YEAR BATTERY LIFE is mindblowing. It's probably a lot less, but my Arlos would last a week with $10 CR123 batteries, so that had to go. Anything had to be better than those dinosaurs.

Set up was fairly easy. There is no real printed instruction manual, but those are rare today. Scanned the QR code and my smartphone popped me to their website with tons of tips, info, and even setup videos. The entire setup process is QR from the new Sync Module 2 to the camera itself. So don't make the mistake of slapping the batteries in and closing the camera unit like I did before I scanned the QR code. Whoops. Took less than 15 minutes to setup and sync. Signed up for a new Blink account so the old one won't get confused - plus there's several weeks of free cloud storage right now. Boom.

Set it up in a tree ACROSS from my house this time. When I put it over my door, my old cameras would flag every car or pedestrian close and far. All I want to see is the jerk stealing my UPS packages, so I flipped the perspective. The HD is super clean and clear, and the camera is at least 30 feet from the sync module with no problems connecting. Big plus there. And, there's a pretty powerful little speaker in this unit! I was really surprised at the volume this thing can push for such a small speaker. Now, when this alerts me to funny business, maybe I'll be able to yell at the perps. Probably not, because they'll be long gone by the time I see the notification. Still, this feature could be useful in warning your kids from doing something silly when you're not home.

The live view was disappointing, since you have to keep clicking the app to continue the live view for longer than 10-ish seconds. So you can't use this as a spying device or a baby monitor. Bummer. Also, the default recording time was like 5 seconds, probably to maximize battery life. You can't catch much in 5 seconds. I adjusted mine in the settings to about 20 seconds. I'll sacrifice battery life to catch a bad actor. Plus, there's a battery pack you can attach to this unit to increase battery life. I'll update in the future to let you know how the battery goes.

Overall, I'm impressed with the new Blink outdoor. It's gonna rain here in Florida soon, so I'll let you know how that goes as well as night shots when available.",positive
197,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,5,"I was fortunate to buy in early on the Blink camera system. Therefore, I have the included cloud coverage. Only recently did I find out just what an advantage that was.

After buying my initial system, I continued to add cameras to the initial sync module. I ultimately ended up having two additional sync modules from systems I purchased after the original system. I was under the impression that all my cameras had to be connected to the original sync module to continue receiving free cloud coverage.

I currently have a mixture of cameras to include 3-XT2, 4-Outdoor, 1-Indoor (2nd gen) and 2-Mini. I was using a schedule to arm the cameras, but I was disappointed that the system would not allow individual scheduling for each camera.

I recently decided to use my additional sync modules to divide my cameras into different zones and allow myself to set different schedules for each zone. Even if it meant the additional modules would not include free cloud coverage, I felt the scheduling control would be worth it.

I was happily surprised to find that even the newer modules set up under the original system included free cloud coverage. Therefore, I now have three different zones that can be individually scheduled. And furthermore, I can add up to 10 cameras to each module.

I only ran into one problem with the setup. The second module I had purchased had been sitting in the box for probably about a year. When I tried to add a camera to it, it would not connect. I called customer support and the first person wasn’t able to help me. I decided to investigate the problem myself and noticed there was a huge difference in the firmware on the second module.

I expected that the firmware of the second module would automatically update, and there was no way to initiate an update within the App. Since it didn’t automatically update, I called customer service back and told them the problem. The individual I spoke with didn’t seem to understand the issue, so I simply insisted that the module’s firmware had to be updated by them.

It took a number of increments to finally update the firmware once the issue had been escalated to the appropriately skilled technician. I insisted that the customer service representative stay on the line until the firmware of the second module exactly matched that of the existing module. I wasn’t trying to go through another 30 minute hold and 20 minute update again.

After the firmware was updated, I was able to add cameras to the second module. I will monitor the module to make sure future firmware updates occur.

I realize that the cloud coverage or camera support may change or discontinue in the future. But for the time being, I’m quite happy with my Blink system.",positive
198,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,3,"I've purchased a total of 4 Blink Outdoor + 3 Blink Mini cameras, plus a sync module and USB backup drive for the security system at my retail space. It's honestly probably the best and easiest way to get a security system installed without wires at a small business. Yes I have used Ring, and Canary. I prefer Blink. Since I’ve seen this now at brick and mortar retail locations, in addition to Amazon, I figure a review might help you make an informed purchase (spoiler, I love it).

This review really supports all of Blink’s camera products, as an ecosystem, though Amazon strangely would only let me review the standalone “Outdoor” camera. So you can infer details to the rest of Blink’s product lineup. You should know that Amazon purchased Blink in 2018, so I hope it gets some attention with new software features and hardware refresh.

Pros:
* Wireless. As long as you have reasonably good wifi, the cameras work. I use a mesh system to cover 6000+ sq ft of space, and all the cameras record and alert me.
* Battery. The outdoor cameras run on 2 AA lithium batteries. I don’t know how, but they last WAY longer than comparable rechargeable batteries for competing camera brands
* Price. Blink’s system is very price competitive. The mini cameras are downright cheap. The Outdoor cameras are competitive, considering how long the battery lasts, how small they are, how easy they are to install, and the superb reliability.
* Footage. Blink paid plan is cheap and stores a month of
* App. It’s simple and straightforward. Easy to view alert footage, and pull up recent footage. Wish it was easier to organize/review past footage… once you’re past a week it get tedious and hectic to find anything quickly and efficiently.
* Communication: You can speak into your phone with the app open and have a 2-way conversation with any party present at individual cameras. I’ve used this feature to communicate with staff, and also warn maleficent actors to leave the premises before I notify authorities.
* Sensitivity: You can customize a bunch of the toggles for camera recording, active area, sensitivity etc which is great. It’s not quite as intuitive as Ring or Canary which literally let you draw areas to avoid or record, but the toggles for the recording area as well as sensitivity triggers, recording length, quality, notification lights, etc are intuitive and great.

Cons:
* Multiple Locations: Currently Blink does not allow you to have multiple locations for your Blink system. This is a real bummer because I would easily buy this same system for my home, office, and to help keep an eye on my elderly parents at their house. Unfortunately you can’t. To do this you have to have a separate Blink account for each location, and manually log out and then log in to the location you want to pay attention to. That defeats the purpose of a security system, if you can’t receive timely notifications from all of your security cameras. If you have to manually review footage, it’s too late to help.
* User Access: Another big annoyance is you can’t selectively invite users to access your account with different access permissions. So currently I am the only person reviewing my Blink account. It would be a big help to delegate managers and other authorized administrators, especially in a multi-location environment where you want your family to have access to home security, your staff access to office security, but don’t want those groups to see the other cameras. I hope Blink implements robust user invitations and sharing access once Multiple Locations is supported.
* Geo-Fencing: There is no geolocated ability to arm, disarm, or set location-based trigger schedules for Blink. It’s either time, or manual arming or disarming. I also use a Canary system, and one of the big perks is the ability to have the system automatically switch gears if you or particular people come and go from a location. Wish I could do that for Blink, to have it automatically arm itself with the most sensitive settings when my staff leaves the location for the night.
* Auto-Delete: Once your USB drive is full, expect daily notifications that “local storage is full”. It asks you to delete footage to make room for more, which is pointless, because at the end of each day it will automatically do this (since the USB drive automatically clears old footage as needed, but still sends the annoying notification about storage being full).

Other:
* Neighbors App: Integrates with a community, I don’t use this much, but great feature to have especially for neighborhood safety.
* Amazon: You purchase your premium subscription through Amazon, and link your Amazon account to your Blink account.
* Alexa Integration: I use a series of Alexa devices with screens throughout the retail space to quickly look at cameras if I get an alert with my phone. Take a second to wake each camera (especially battery-operated Outdoor cams), and is very useful for safety and suspicious activity.
* Outdoor Mount: The outdoor cameras can be easily “popped” off their mount, if a maleficent person knows what’s up and decides to take a camera.
* Battery Life: The battery life of Blink Outdoor with 2 AA Lithium is good enough to not be a con. However the battery life is significantly less than “2 years” advertised. So far I’ve had to change the batteries on all four of my Outdoor cameras about every 3-4 months. Unfortunately there’s no alert or indicator to tell you if the battery is about to die. It’s either “OK” or the camera goes offline (with a slow blinking red light on the physical device).

VERDICT:

Blink is a great system, I totally recommend it as long as you only have one location and you are the sole user. The price is great, the performance is reliable with quality coverage, and it’s comparable, if not better than competitors.

If you need security systems at multiple residences or other locations, want to automate the system arming/triggers based on your geo-location, and need to invite and grant specific access to different people (friends vs staff) you should definitely avoid Blink and look to Canary or Ring for a security solution.

If the three major cons were address I would easily increase my rating from 3 to 5 stars. I hope Blink (and Amazon) is listening!",fair
199,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,4,"I've only had these outdoor cameras for a few days, so I won't comment on battery life yet. But overall, I'm very happy with these cameras and most of their features. I'm nitpicking a bit here, which is why there are so many Cons. They are minor issues outweighed by the Pros.

PROS:
* Setup was relatively simple--once you understand it--but the instructions weren't (see below)
* Infrared is awesome in the darkest environments and does a good job switching between IR and non-IR automatically
* Motion detection works well, as does the 1-9 sensitivity setting, although this requires some tweaking until you find the right setting for each camera
* Daytime video quality is excellent and good enough to read stationary license plates up to about 50 feet.
* Audio quality is amazing! Individual birds and nearby bees can be heard easily, and normal volume conversations within about 20 feet can be understood.

CONS:
* The cameras seem to require an active Internet connection, not just a wifi connection (although I could be wrong). This may be because the initial setup requires you to use cloud storage. This could become a problem if your Internet connection is lost or dropped.
* Initial setup requires storage in the cloud (for the free trial), even if you install a USB drive in the sync module. I have not found a way to disable the cloud storage. This cloud storage requirement may be slowing down the entire system, since it forces everything to constantly use the Internet.
* Setup instructions were weird and unintuitive. The included booklet simply said to install the app. And the app is kind of confusing at first, and I ended up trying to create an account (and failing) and adding the sync module several times until I figured out what it was doing (and I'm an experienced techie). The basic problem is the app requires cameras to be installed only by following certain steps, with no other option.
* Setup requires the mobile app and an active internet connection to install the cameras.
* Accessing the cameras and video clips requires the mobile app. There are no desktop app or web options.
* Cannot schedule individual cameras. The weekly/hourly schedule can only be set for all cameras attached to a sync module. This is unfortunate and will make the scheduling feature useless for most people. It would also be helpful to be able to set quality, motion detection sensitivity, and IR settings on a schedule. The settings I use for night time would be different than the middle of the day or when I'm not at home.
* No quality setting on the audio. There are multiple settings for quality of the videos, to conserve batteries, but there's no way to turn down the audio quality, for battery conservation. The included audio quality is great, but it seems to be ""too"" high for the purpose of these cameras.
* Only 2 AA batteries in each camera. This could become very cumbersome to replace batteries if your camera is installed in a hard-to-reach location. The cameras SHOULD have 6, 8, or 10 batteries instead, so you don't have to replace them often. I would happily pay the extra battery cost so that I wouldn't have to climb up there very often.
* When a camera is ""in use"", its settings cannot be changed, and if you try to change the settings, you'll get an error message, causing the app's settings screen to get out of sync with the camera's actual settings, until you go back and modify the settings again.
* The ""Talk"" feature produces garbled, broken, delayed (by 3-5 seconds) audio that is unintelligible, no matter how close the camera and sync module are to your router. I have about 115 Mbps bandwidth, and it made no difference. You will never be able to use this to have a conversation of any type, even if they could understand what you're saying. This seems like a very odd flaw since the recorded audio is so excellent. This was obviously an oversight by the engineers.
* The Android app's setting to disable the vibration on notifications doesn't work. It always uses my phone's setting and ignores the app's setting.
* Insects near my 4 cameras are causing 15-30 false alerts per day right now, until I can figure out a better placement or setting. Other than the wear on the batteries, this is not a huge deal, but it can be annoying.
* The installation hardware is inadequate. Each camera comes with 2 large wood screws that are too big and too long for almost every installation. Much smaller wood screws and double-sided tape or Velcro would have been much more practical. I ended up not using any of the screws that came with the cameras because they were too big or impossible to use on the required surfaces.
* The back panels on the cameras are VERY weird to remove for battery installation. There are no instructions that I could find on how to do this, and the included plastic tools are not intuitive. I nearly broke one of the cameras trying to get the back panel off using the included tool. There's a certain trick to hooking and unhooking the tool from the back panel that you'll have to figure out on your own.
* The cameras and lenses are fully exposed to sunlight and weather, which is not ideal. The cameras should come with a small hood the lens or camera to protect it even more from weather and shade from light.
* User access cannot be customized. The only way to give someone access to a camera is to give them your password to your account and entire system. It would be helpful to be able to grant someone limited or temporary access, such as a neighbor, child, relative, or visitor.",positive

I own the the original 8 HD, the next generation, and now the latest. Obviously if you love the Amazon environment as I do, you can't go wrong with this tablet. I never ventured into the Apple world simply because I couldn't afford it on a teacher's salary and because I was already invested in Prime.

All of my tablets continue to function without any issues. The 8HD is beginning to show its age because the operation system can't update to the latest and greatest due to hardware issues. But it still will be grabbed for reading and listening to music.

Durable. That is what I would call these tablets. If I was going to use the tablets for other than recreational use, I would be looking for.something else. But as it is, the tablets do what I want them to do at a price point that keeps.me happy.

There are a couple.of issues that have been consistent across the three versions I own. The first is that the battery life has been ,""meh, "". All models promoted themselves as having really decent battery life. That was true when new. All three seemed to begin losing battery life within the first 6-10 months of usage. I am very careful with my charging protocol, making sure I don't just leave them on charge overnight like some people do.

Nowever, with three tablets, I always have one fully charged and ready to go.

The second issue I have with the Amazon tablets is the placement of the volume and power buttons. You would think Amazon could afford some decent investigation into now people.actually handle the tablet when using it. This latest version has been the absolute most annoying. When holding it in my hands, I frequently find I've accidentally changed the volume or turned the tablet off. The 8HD's buttons were recessed enough I never had this problem. But the later versions of the tablet all have the buttons sticking out farther from the case making them easier to locate but also.easier to accidently hit. And, whoever thought the on/off button should be directly under the volume button should never be allowed in a product design studio again.

A minor complaint is the spellchecker. Absolutely the worst I've ever seen. If you don't mind random periods and single words changed into two that don't make sense, like 'because' being change into 'be wise' (Huh?), then this probably won't bother you. Also if your high school English teacher drilled poofreading into your mindset, you should find this spellchecker subroutine an extension of heaven!

All in all, I would give these Amazon tablets a solid 4.5 out of 5 stars for the price point, durability, and ease of use in the Amazon environment. If you're looking for a tablet more for its entertainment value , you can't beat one of these.",positive

Figured it wise to disclose this up front. I’m not adept at all android os devices yet, but learning on the fire tablet has been decently intuitive and relatively easy. For the past 8 years, I’ve used an Apple iPad Air 2013 model that I got refurbished in 2014. It was always a crisp screen view and has held up since I bought the one with the most memory available. This Spring (2022), I noticed that more and more apps were not opening because the outdated OS no longer supported those apps. I kept using the iPad since streaming services were still working. That ended in June 2022–suddenly several of the streaming apps I regularly used stopped opening. I really didn’t want to spend upwards of $1,000 on a new or recently used iPad, so I looked into this recent model Fire tablet. This has been a good alternative so far! The screen resolution while streaming is good. The Home Screen resolution isn’t nearly as crisp as my old iPad was, but I got this Fire tablet on Prime Day for well under $100 (so freaking solid quality nonetheless given how much money I saved). Setting the Fire up was pretty easy, and I’ve been using the kindle feature on it far more than I ever used on my iPhone. I liked how the screen can be personalized, and have generally enjoyed this Fire for the few weeks I had it so far. The only real pain in the @$$ though is despite extending the screen sleep timer to 10+ minutes this thing routinely auto dims or sends its screen into sleep mode frequently while I am actively using it! It’s really annoying, because I can’t just hit a home button to awaken it—I typically have to close the magnetic cover & reopen it. I’m getting used to the exercise, but it’s sure noisome! Maybe this a user error issue?! I’m a bit ignorant on this point and my lack of experience with Fire tablets must be acknowledged. That said, it’s why I knocked off a star. I’ll try to update this review in the future once I’ve better familiarized myself with the OS and researched some online troubleshooting remedy discussions.",positive

Oh, sure. There were hurtful rumors that it jumped, but I still insist it was an accident.

Anyway, the replacement did away with the keyboard, and installed an infuriating pop-up version on which I am forever making typos.This was presumably to increase the screen size. More importantly, they removed the earphone jack. As I spent a fair amount of time listening to the electronic voice reading, while did something else....big issue.

Now we come to my decision to upgrade my smaller Fire tablet to a bigger screen. Being that I put thing off at a Professional level, my wife ended up getting me this as an early birthday present. I encountered yet another 'dump': I can only listen to a book if I own the Audible version. Which means, in essence, about 20 titles, most of which are books I wrote and released through ACX. Since you would literally have to beat me into submission to abandon a ton of better books to listen those...well, you get the general idea. I have probably 900 books that I can't audible skim through while working crosswords or balancing the national debt. So, okay, that latter bit is just an excuse I give my wife, and I suspect she's starting to catch onto the fact.

ANYWHOO...

I'm keeping the smaller Fire to essentially replace my Kindle, but this is a HUGE omission for me. Would it have taken up that much memory to leave the auto-read feature in place?????????

It does everything I want and does it well, so I am very pleased with it. It's much faster than the previous version. I know because I went back to it after finishing a book on my new one and the load time of a book that was already downloaded to it was about the same as the wait to download and open a book on the new. Watching video is a pleasure, the color depth is excellent and the CPU on this version is fast enough that the WIFI is the limiting factor on how video is displayed. we watched ""Tombstone"" on the laptop and there was no buffering.

I primarily use tablets for streaming purposes, audio and video. This device does both very well.
My primary apps:
iHeart Radio
Peacock
ESPN
xfinity Stream (companion app for Cable TV)
Amazon Prime
Amazon Prime Music
Spotify

All of those apps work well. Video quality is equal to an iPad (yes I also have one of those).
iHeart Radio has a problem with streaming one particular radio station on this tablet, but I suspect it is not primarily a Fire problem.

I typically use bluetooth headphones, but the built-in speakers work well when I need them.

Battery life is multiple days for me. I typically run the battery down to 10% then charge up to 90%. (it helps having another tablet available)

Of note -- fast charging via USB-C works fine with this tablet.

Of note 2 -- no YouTube app, but! You can download an 'app' (on-screen button) that just opens youtube.com, which works just fine.

No one has to press buttons, just talk to the tablet. And if something happens to the tablet we aren't out a lot of $$. So far they have taken a lot of falls and the tablets have held up well.

Initially, I wanted only a reader, but found out the Kindle readers' memories are not expandable; the tablets are with a separately bought card. Having an e-library of over 7200 books & documents, I wanted a unit where as many items as possible could be downloaded & then accessed without wifi; as best as I can tell, this is doable. What I find most aggravating is the over riding Alexa, as well as some other settings like notifications. No matter how many times I check every possible setting for each app, Fire 10 (2021) repeatedly over rides. I don't use it for playing games, watching movies, or listening to music. I don't access any email or social media accounts, not even a calendar. As I said, I really only wanted a unit that could hold a lot of downloaded reading materials. There isn't the option to uninstall useless apps & the disable buttons are nonfunctional; the only viable option is to force stop. In the month of ownership, I've had to stop all of the Alexa apps & all notifications more than 4 times! I am unimpressed with its battery life. In a typical usage of 2 & 1/2 hours, the battery reduces 25%. The touch screen is not as sensitive to finger touch as it is to a stylus.

When this new model 10 inch Fire Tablet was reduced in price during the holidays in 2021, I decided it was time to make the jump to a larger screen (more (paper) book sized) and gain more battery ife per charge due to a larger battery.

This 10 incher did not disappoint at all. As a primary use for Kindle books, I'm getting 20 or more % battery life then the 12 hours the specs suggest this tablet can get.

The screen quality for reading is perfect. I typically set it to lower brightness (fixed) and there's no glare in the eyes nor any eye strain when using in a darkened bedroom at night.

The faster processor then my older 8 inch HD clearly adds some speed to anything you do on this tablet.

There's no lag at all in trying it for video, gaming, etc. As stated though, for me, I use a Fire Tablet primarily as a reader, period.

Screen resolution and contrast is excellent, certainly not any better ( and a little less) than my iPad PRO, but, of course we're talking a big difference in cost between tablets here and very different display technologies as well.

That said, this 10 inch HD Tablet is no slouch in offering a clear, sharp/detailed display with very sufficient color saturation and accuracy plus nice crisp text over-all.

Given Amazon offers just about any app needed for this fire Tablet, it certainly could be used for just about everything that an iPad could be and at a competitive price to the new basic model iPad model that sells in the $330+ dollar range now.

Some reviewers said due to where the camera is (oddly) located, one must use this Fire tablet in a case with the cover opening to the right rather then to the conventional left, but, not true. Since this tablet can flip screen orientation based on where the top of screen is located, I'm using a hard shell case for my Fire and the conventional left cover opening as normal. Granted the camera is at the bottom left corner in my configuration, but, that is no issue since if one needs to use the camera, they can orient the tablet however they wish and the screen (and camera) will orient as needed for photos.

The net here is you can use the tablet in a case and flip open the left cover as normal.

As an owner of both an iPad Mini and an iPad Pro 11 inch, I can say in all honesty, anyone wanting a tablet on a budget and hoping to get some decent performance and screen quality plus great battery life won't be disappointed at all in this new model 10 inch Fire Tablet.

I got the base 32 GB version with ads. Ads only show on the screen saver when opening up the sleep/wake cover and a one finger flip up of the screen goes back to where you left off or the home screen. Ads really are not a biggie in this context at all.

Given one can add a micro SD card to gain more storage space, and Micro SD cards are dirt cheap now, the 32GB version is fine for me.

No complaints at all and 5 stars all around for this Fire Tablet. A well designed tablet at a very good price.

I highly recommend it! If you order one, it'll be a definite ""keeper"".",positive
209,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Black",$129.99,5,"Just before Christmas in 2021, this item popped up on sale for just $75. We’re an apple family. We have numerous iPads in the house, plus our iPhones, Mac, MacBooks, Apple TV, etc. I’m an audio mixer, and use a product from Avid called the S1. It’s a control surface for Pro Tools that is meant to house a tablet for additional functionality- or eye candy. My older IPad worked, but looked tiny in the cradle, and wasn’t all that useable. I wanted something bigger, but didn’t want to spend the money on yet another iPad. For $75, I was willing to roll the dice.

It fits great, looks great, and does exactly what I bought it for.

But then I started to explore it deeper. It has built in Alexa with the wake word Amazon. As an audio engineer working from home, I sporadically have actors coming to record. I’ve got Ring doorbells at the entrances, and Echo devices in nearly every room. But for the first time, I can say “Amazon, show me the front door!”, and actually SEE it- and a lot faster than the Ring app on my phone would allow. This was a nice bonus. In fact, in my experience and opinion, Alexa works for much quicker and more reliably than Siri, that I’ve found myself relying on it a lot more. Having Alexa in the tablet to verbalize reminders, appointments, phone calls, etc- all right in front of me, is amazing!

I became fascinated with my new toy, and downloaded all the steaming media we subscribe to, plus other apps for news and weather that provide lots of content. I quickly found that I enjoyed watching tv on a 10 inch screen a lot more than on my iPhone. It’s nice to have lunch at the table with my kiddo and share a video we can both easily see and hear. So- this little guy has a great screen and works perfectly for watching shows, movies, YouTube, news, etc.

Now- I love my iPhone, and have my music library in iTunes. But when I purchase music, it’s always via Amazon. This is because I get my MP3 files instantly for most albums- but then have a physical disc arrive that often goes unopened. I just like know that HAVE the disc if I ever need to load it again or want to enjoy it in my stereo system. My iPhone can store a decent amount of music internally for when streaming isn’t an option. But I was floored to learn that the HD10 2021 has a micro SD card slot that can store up to 1 TB!!! That’s amazing to me. I can preload entire series, movies, music, photos- anything I need for a long trip or chilling in downtime. For like $25 I added a 400 gig card. Why iPads don’t have this is beyond me.

I work with and coach voice actors outside of my day job as a recording engineer. Having that much memory on a tablet and access to an app like WavePad, gives them the ability to record in a pinch while away from their studios. On-screen editing is also fun and easy. I actually added a nifty stylus and case to my HD10, along with a Bluetooth keyboard. It’s essentially a mobile studio, albeit limited.

While I haven’t experimented a ton with this- Silk browser (which seems to run on Chrome) allows me to use Source Connect Now to tap into actors or listen to sessions remotely at “CD quality”. Of course you can also use Zoom, Skype, etc.

As an apple user, I still want access to my ICloud apps, like Contacts, calendar, Pages, Keynote, Numbers, etc. You can log into your iCloud account and get it all. The trick is to choose “request desktop site”, otherwise you dead-end at “find my device”. You can even log into Apple Music via the browser. So all my apple stuff is still with me!

I chose Outlook email to run my various work and personal emails and have a unified calendar. It’s perfect for what I need.

213,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Ring Chime,$34.99,4,"I have a ring doorbell connected to one of those basic wired doorbell chimes that rings with a basic 2 chime sound. The problem with that chime is that it is hard to hear from the first floor of the house, since it is located upstairs, and I don’t always have my phone on me when someone rings the bell. So, I was looking for an extender for the chime and I didn’t realize that Ring makes the Chime, which is essentially a doorbell extender without the need to put a battery-operated signaler into the chime itself. I had one of those types a couple years ago and they tend not to last long.

Ring makes two different types of Chimes, this basic one and one that adds a few bells and whistles, such as a wi-fi extender and night light, which for me, is unnecessary, as well as drives up the price. Regardless, I think even the basic one is a bit overpriced at 30 bucks, although they are slightly cheaper than the regular extenders, which are 35 to 45 bucks.

These are pretty simple to install. Just plug into a wall outlet, go to the ring app and scan the QR code in the box to add. Like most things these days, there is an immediate firmware update for the device, which takes a few minutes to complete. When connecting or updating, there is a flashing light on the front of the chime to indicate that it is. Otherwise, a solid light will show that it is connected. Granted, the biggest disadvantage of this device is that it works at the mercy of the reliability of your wireless network. If you have spotty wireless, then this may not be as reliable as you want and if your household is like mine, this adds another wireless device into a mass of devices on an already overloaded router. So far though, the device has stayed reliability connected to my network with no issues.

Now, you can set the chime to ring for both motion and/or act just like a doorbell chime would when someone rings the bell. I, personally, see no need to have it sound off every time there is motion, especially since the ring doorbell picks up the neighbors pulling in and out of their driveway, so I set it to only chime when someone rings the doorbell. I have put this chime on the first floor, since I can never hear the bell in the family room when I am watching TV.

Volume can be set on the ring app. After seeing some complain about the volume, I was concerned that it would not be loud enough, but to my surprise, at max volume, the chime is fairly loud. Maybe this was fixed with the firmware update, I don’t know. This seems to be dependent on what chime you select in the ring app though. Some of the chimes are louder than others. I selected the default chime app as it seemed to be one of the loudest from the group of 10 to 15 selections that are included. It would have been nice to be able to add your own chime, such as a rock music chime or something, but at least currently that is not a feature.

This has a two-year warranty, so hopefully it lasts not only through the warranty, but longer than that.
So far, this chime is doing what I want it to do, which is to be a chime extender in a part of the house where I can’t hear my original wired chime. I do think that it should be priced around 20 bucks instead of 30 for a basic chime and being dependent on your network, your mileage may vary on its connectivity. Otherwise, I am satisfied with the chime and I ended up getting a second one for the basement.

220,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, 4K Ultra HD, includes latest Alexa Voice Remote",$69.99,5,"So, this is my third purchase of the Cube. I purchased one not long after it first came out, then another one late last year (I wanted the updated, latest and greatest version), and then I bought this one (on sale) not long ago, as a birthday gift for my son.

We both have 4K TVs - I have the 65"" 2021 LG C1 OLED TV, and he has a 65"" Samsung (no idea which model). We both do a lot of streaming, and the Cube excels at 4K UHD content, with more and more of it appearing every month. NOTE: proper HDMI 2.2 cables are critical!

Netflix seems to stream more 4K UHD content than anyone else, but Disney+, HBO Max, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime, YouTube Premium, Paramount+ (all of which I subscribe to) are beginning to catch up. I also have a satellite feed for network TV, sports, national and local news.

I can't comment on the Alexa or voice recognition features of the Cube, primarily because I don't use them. I'm old AND old school, and I flat refuse to talk to inanimate objects; including cars! I talk to our dog, our cats, my girlfriend/life partner and our friends and neighbors. Most LIVING things I can relate to. NON-living things; not so much.

One thing I will comment on , though, is the new Cube remote control; it's GREAT! The original, old remote was/is a bit unpredictable at times, and the symbols on ALL the buttons wore off after a few short months. The new remote is rock solid, and after MORE than a few months, ALL the buttons still look pristine! It's a very simple remote to memorize, which doesn't take long at all, and to me, that's it's best virtue!

One thing I dispise, though, is the Cube's sleep functionality. Specifically, there's no way to DISABLE it; at least that I can find in the various menus. I have and use an Amazon Photos account (I'm a photographer) as my Screen Saver to display my photos (as a playlist) That works great on a computer and cell phone, but after a relatively short period of time on the Cube, it puts itself to sleep, and there's NO WAY to disable that #×$%€£& functionality!!

WHY do I hate that feature so much? When we have friends over, rather than watching a show or movie, and so we can talk without interruption, I like to start up the Screen Saver so I can display my latest photos for them to view. The downside is I have to manually scroll forward or backward periodically to prevent the Cube from putting itself to sleep, and I HATE having to do that!!

That is THE most brain-dead feature I've ever come across! Whoever the developer is who came up with that feature should be FIRED! WHY do I have to do ANYTHING to keep displaying photos from my AMAZON PHOTOS ACCOUNT on my AMAZON FIRE TV CUBE?!? Why are those two things so obviously incompatable with each other?!?

I don't have to do ANYTHING when I'm watching a movie or a documentary! Why does the Cube treat displaing photos as just wasting electricity and put itself to SLEEP!?! It's infuriating!

What I've had to revert to is to install and set up a Plex server on my photo editing computer, install the Plex app on the Cube, create a Plex playlist of the photos I want to stream, run the Plex app on the Cube and select the Plex photos playlist so I can stream the EXACT SAME PHOTOS that are in my AMAZON PHOTOS ACCOUNT thru the Cube to my TV.

Doing THAT is apparently is okay with the Cube's sleep function and it DOESN'T consider that to be wasting electicity and it DOESN'T put itself to sleep!?! Seriously?!? YES! SERIOUSLY!

WHY DO I HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH ANY HOOPS AT ALL TO DISPLAY PHOTOS FROM MY AMAZON PHOTOS ACCOUNT ON MY AMAZON FIRE TV CUBE?!?! WHY CAN'T I DISABLE SLEEP MODE IN MY AMAZON FIRE TV CUBE?!? IS IT MY CUBE OR NOT?!? IS IT MY ELECTRICTY TO WASTE OR NOT!?! Explain THAT one to me in logical terms! Photos are PHOTOS! Why should it matter WHERE or WHAT app they come from?!?

ANYWAY, aside from the Cube's brain-dead sleep functionality, I REALLY like the VERY high quality video it feeds my OLED TV! It is superb and as good as anything I've ever seen! I also have the latest version of the Roku Ultra (also purchased on Amazon), but I rarely use it anymore. Why?

Well, the Roku user interface just seems very clunky, in a Windows 1.0 kind of way, if anyone out there in TV land can relate to that analogy. It's just not as elegant or as intuitive as the Cube's GUI (Grapical User Interface), which is VERY elegant, VERY modern, and HIGHLY intuitive! I'm sure all that is purely subjective, though.

And that's how I see the Cube. If you're not a photographer or you don't have an Amazon Photo account and/or you have no interest in streaming photos from your Amazon Photo account directly to your Cube via its built-in Screen Saver, just ignore what I wrote about the Cube's brain-dead sleep function. Everything else I wrote about the Cube is the honest truth!

It's GREAT for streaming 4K UHD movies and ANY other form of video content! It's also a bargain! HIGHLY recommended!",positive
221,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, 4K Ultra HD, includes latest Alexa Voice Remote",$69.99,5,"My vision is all but useless now. Managing different remotes and different apps across different platforms is difficult. After going through a short power outage and then dead batteries on a tv remote, I quickly learned my place. Having to reprogram remotes to the tv, cable, and stereo was not possible without adequate vision. I decided it was time to try the fire tv cube when it went on sale for prime day. If you are visually impaired this is a life saver. The initial setup was difficult without seeing until I realized I could do most on my iPads Alexa app using voice over. Once it’s setup and going you learn one thing fast when using voice view, the built in screen reader for the bvi. Change the name! If you leave it as Alexa, it triggers your other Alexa devices as it gives you helpful auditory hints as it says out loud quote try saying Alexa show me whatever. Every other device in your house will say I’m sorry I don’t know how to do that. So, use computer or echo to avoid this. It’s amazing as I really don’t even need a remote now, but it comes with one and it’s handy every now and then. It can turn your tv, cable, stereo automatically by asking it to turn on tv. It can do everything verbally like volume up, down, mute, change channels, change streaming service, plus all the normal Alexa stuff. It’s pretty fantastic! Now for what I don’t like.

In setup you can select to play audio descriptions when available. Sounds great, but it doesn’t work. You have to start a show and then change audio to audio descriptions and then it’s on for so shows that have it within that app only. You have to do this for every streaming app that supports audio descriptions. Amazon should have a button on your account to notify them we are bvi, and then any Alexa device we order should automatically change the settings to enable voice view and audio descriptions as soon as it’s plugged in and connected to the internet!

Across all my previous apps on the tv, cable, or PlayStation movies and shows verbally announced when audio descriptions are available before you selected them across different apps like Hulu, Netflix, prime, etc.. The fire tv cube does not do this. I’ve selected shows that I have seen before that I know have audio descriptions but it does not tell you. You have to start the selection and see if it plays or search the internet and see what has audio descriptions. Amazon needs to fix this as it’s impossible to know what does and does not have ad. Again, if we could select bvi in our Amazon account they should only show us content with ad. We could search for other content if we wanted. It’s a major undertaking trying to find things with ad! Hulu has a hub button which has an audio descriptions category but it’s not entirely accurate, I wish everyone else had a specific ad category!

The device is a little glitchy. When asking the cube to do certain things, ie go home, it does go home but will drop audio. When doing this with the remote, press the home button, this doesn’t happen. It’s no big deal you just press volume up on a remote or ask the cube volume up, and it comes back on.

Voice view in YouTube gets annoying sometimes when searching. Once you select content you searched for, it plays but simultaneously blurbs out a long winded blurb that overshadows the content audio. If you tell her to stop, she stops the content not the blabber mouth.

Other little annoyances are when you switch to a different input like antenna or cable, five minutes into whatever your watching, gets interrupted by Alexa saying screen off as the Home Screen you’re no longer using turns off.

Hopefully they’ll work the bugs out as we go but this is a must have for anyone whose bvi!",positive
222,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, 4K Ultra HD, includes latest Alexa Voice Remote",$69.99,5,"-I do apologize for the lengthy review but. please read! Thank you. =-) ^_^ <3
Before I purchase this item I got a TV because my old TV went out you know what they say about a certain brand TV and I think we all know what that brand is they usually last 5 years then something goes wrong with them. starts with Samsu-.., you know right? So then I bought a cheap under $300 very good HDR TV only problem it came with Roku they are so close software and strict as well as not letting you do anything not even be able to hook your Bluetooth devices that buying something like this will blow your mind.
The Alexa feature is amazing.
She can control your TV and other peripherals and devices without you having to use your phone and she can be available on your phone if you want her to be or him whichever you prefer. <- take that Roku! With the ability to install apps in many ways which is highly recommended that you stick with the Amazon apps is a wonderful feature. The stream quality is amazing, it is a very powerful device.
The voice recognition is the greatest I've ever seen as well as Alexa being able to do many things that you tell her to do without even having to look at your phone or anything even from the other room Alexa integration is the best I've seen so far of any device.
With everything else I own I have become a Tech sorcerer. Conjuring up Solutions and creations in so many many ways. but that being said as you would guess everything is a fight. But not with Alexa she does it simply easily she can wake you up at whatever time you want she functions as pretty much every other electronic device and from what I've seen maybe even cook your food someday if not already possible or anything.
I think she needs more features though like to be able to carry a conversation and have ai implemented so that she could be almost like being with another person for people who are alone or for people who have families and children also with a wide variety of all kinds of dialogue trees if you're an adult you can have an adult conversation if you have children she can be set not to go into those subjects the freedom to say whatever she wants as long as you speak first or you can set her to speak to you first if you want.
That's why I'm giving this device five stars on everything.",positive
223,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, 4K Ultra HD, includes latest Alexa Voice Remote",$69.99,5,"I went into this purchase thinking it would be a minor upgrade compared to my AppleTV setup. I can be pretty frugal when it comes to minor upgrades, but Prime Day came around and I pulled the trigger.

Set Up Experience: Set up was very easy despite our varied sources. Prime Video, Netflix, Plex, Disney+, not to mention our cable provider (we still haven't cut the cord yet), Curiosity Stream, and others. We picked our apps, which we were able to authorize mostly with links instead of having to remember / enter a password, set up child safety (more on that later), and proceeded to stream our first movie with about 15 minutes.

Voice Interaction: Alexa, as usual, just worked with some standard commands, but also recognized natural language when selecting items on screen and navigating without the remote control. She even recognizes our 5 year old that still has some challenges with the letter 'R'. The microphones are very sensitive and work very well even picking up our commands from nearby rooms (we do have several devices in the house). Having a single voice assistant that can control the entertainment, lighting, thermostat, and confirm that the garage door is closed, is really nice. Not to mention asking about weather, news, etc.

Streaming Quality: I'm no video / pixel-phile, but I was very happy with the quality of the streams and the responsiveness. It appears that it is all on par with AppleTV and Roku, both of which I have running on different TVs, though the AppleTV in now another monitor input next to my computer.

Regular Use: We ended up backing out the child safety, as it required a PIN for just about everything, precluding our little guy from being able to ""Watch Encanto on Disney+"" as an example, but with at least one of us always being in close proximity to him, we're not worried about him getting into content he shouldn't be. Again, though in regards to using the Cube, it just works. We have the occasional time that someone is trying to get alexa to do something, someone else comes into the room and says the command and it works, but other than that, I'd say interaction in regular use is 4.5/5, including ""Alexa, play the Encanto soundtrack.""

All around, I'm really happy with the purchase and the Prime Day discount, but even at full price, it would have been worth picking up, for the sheer convenience of it. Being able to watch interact and be entertained without the need a of a remote control is pretty awesome. Star Trek like. ;)

I hope this has helped someone make a decision as to whether the purchase is worth it or not.",positive
224,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, 4K Ultra HD, includes latest Alexa Voice Remote",$69.99,5,"04/07/2022: Ordered this morning, received this afternoon, setup in about 10 mins, and it automatically asked if I wanted to use the backup of my old device. I did. It installed the apps and all I had to do is log into each one. EVERY app but one had the option of logging in via web, so that was all easy-peasy.

So, I've moved my living room TV from a Fire TV devices (2018, 4K, etc.) which, like all the other Fire devices ONLY HAD 8 GB OF STORAGE. I mean, c'mon Amazon! And Google! Both companies are incredibly stingy on memory! So I had about half my apps on the Fire TV device, and half on my Sony Bravia which has Google TV built in. And I'd have to switch back and forth, using the Bravia's remote (which, by the way, is one of the WORST remotes I've ever used!)

I now have ALL the apps from both devices loaded onto this Cube, and it's still showing 10.10GB free! And that includes the JackBox Party Pack, which I had to remove long ago because there was no space.

Plus, this thing handles the apps MUCH better. Paramount+ used to be an extremely slow dog, but now it's just a mildly slow dog. :-) And Disney+ doesn't stall all the time like it used to. Note: I'm talking about navigating the UI. Both those programs played video well enough, it was just getting there that was the chore.

It's long been known that computers operate much better when their storage has some spare room in it. So I won't be filling this thing up, but I sure as heck WILL be putting on some apps I've wanted, but couldn't have!

With my setup, all I really need IR-wise is volume and on/off control. And I thought I'd have to use the IR blaster. But no! The remote does IR as well, so I don't even need that. And while I have very fast WiFi with excellent coverage, this thing gives me wired, which I much prefer, AND which performs noticeably better.

I don't expect to be using the Alexa on the cube, since I have an Echo 8"" sitting right next to me in the living room (plus two others in nearby rooms). However this cube does allow you to use alternate ""names"" for Alexa. You can use ""Alexa"", ""Computer"", ""Echo"", or ""Amazon"". I think they should replace ""Echo"" with ""Fire Cube"" or something, but hey, I know most people don't really have this many voice-activated devices, so it's not an issue for them. Anyway, it does seem to work just fine, though I'll probably be disabling the mic so it doesn't answer every time someone says ""computer"" on a TV show I'm watching! :-) And of course, there's always the button on the remote, which I'm used to using for the TV's anyway.

And speaking of the remote, not only does it control the TV volume up/down and power on/off and mute. It's also got a ""Live TV"" button which automagically takes me to my Plex TV guide. Sweet! And it's got four other buttons for Prime, Netflix, Disney, and Hulu, which means I don't have to have any of those on the Home screen, leaving those spots open for other apps.

I don't actually have Hulu, so I reprogrammed that button for Paramount+, and that works fine. Took about 10 minutes, following a YouTube instructional video.

So yeah, all-in-all, I feel like this was DEFINITELY worth the price increase over the Fire Stick Max, which is what I was originally looking at. I didn't get it on sale, but even so, it's TOTALLY worth the extra $ - IMO.",positive
225,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, 4K Ultra HD, includes latest Alexa Voice Remote",$69.99,3,"My use case was pretty specific - my old Denon AV receiver was dying and I wanted to consolidate my old echo dot, roku and harmony remote into a simple, small, low-wattage system. The promise of the learning remote and built-in speaker and HDMI audio out was key to my decision.

I would be using my ancient Sharp 26"" LCD (which is recessed into my wall) and a cheap class-D amplifier, and counting on the Fire cube to perform all alexa-related duties during the day WITHOUT the TV being on (streaming WNYC, setting kitchen timers, etc) as well as streaming video at night (Plex, HD Homerun, Youtube etc) with the TV on.

I ripped out my old receiver, IR blaster etc and plugged everything in. I would also be using an HDMI audio extractor to send audio via bluetooth to a second set of speakers at the other end of the room as well as converting to an analog RCA output for the receiver, so the audio from the cube went to the audio stripper, then out via an rca splitter to the avantree bluetooth transmitter and into my no-name brand (but excellent) tiny class-D amplifer (with IR remote control).

The first attempt to get the Cube to control my Sharp tv successfully turned the TV off, but no amount of IR blaster location changes, profile changes or manual remote learning would turn it on. Eventually I just manually turned the TV on and pressed the >> button after the first power off in setup and proceeded as if it was working. This is KEY to getting the correct Sharp profile set in the Cube.

After many hours of attempts, I found a post in AmazonForum which advised setting Settings > Equipment Control > Manage Equipment > TV > Power Controls > Power Command to ""Discrete On/Off"" and this would now allow the Cube to successfully turn the TV on. Note that if you set the TV to ""other"" and just try learning the remote IR commands, the Cube will NOT successfully be able to turn the TV on. Why? Buggy software. Note that THIS OPTION WILL NOT APPEAR if you try to set up the TV as ""generic"". Nowhere does it say this and tech support is clueless about it.

Next was the amplifier set up. I used a mini-RCA splitter and an old additional RF blaster (uses the same plug) to run separate IR cables to the TV and amplifier (which is inside a cabinet). Since my receiver brand was not among those listed, I picked the first choice, let the setup fail, and then started to manually program the IR codes using the remote.

Nothing I could do would convince the Cube to accept the power on/off or any other commands from the receiver's IR remote. It would just immediately say ""remote not detected"" after I pressed the key and fail. Eventually, I tried using the Harmony remote to transmit the same commands (learned from the original remote) and this DID work for volume up/down and mute. Why? Buggy Software.

Now that I had all the equipment programmed, it was time to reap the fruits of my many, many, many hours of labor. First impressions: all apps are snappy and work pretty well, but the home screen is needlessly cluttered with everything I want EXCEPT the most recent / preferred apps. Also, the Cube definitely does not consistently know when to turn the TV or Receiver on and off, and there is no one command to just turn everything on or off (the remote does allow this). Often I will be streaming music, a timer will go off, and then it will not output audio again over HDMI unless I manually stop and restart the stream.

Attention Amazon Engineers - Please implement the following software changes immediately:
- There is no reason that changing a single component (TV, receiver etc) should necessitate the complete wiping and blank slate reprogramming of ALL components. How hard could it be to allow components to be set up separately, or at least RETAIN THE LAST SETTINGS AND PROGRAMMING as DEFAULTS?
- Numerous times I would be trying to get an ""update"" to the IR profiles, and this would fail with a network error (server unavailable). Did someone enter the wrong server address here? Mapped to your C drive?
- Clearly your IR transmit control is not working properly. I have had many universal remotes and none have ever completely refused to learn commands once the proper physical distance and line of sight was established. If the Cube can power toggle the TV once, it can toggle again. Trust me.
- Would it really be so hard to incorporate a built-in ethernet jack? I realize the usb dongle is a hack you produced for the 1st gen unit, but you've got plenty of real estate in that giant shell and I know if you try hard enough you can squeeze it in.
- IR blaster - did I mention this is terrible? Please at least include a multi-cord cable since nobody will be stashing their cubes in their cabinets (with their amps etc) if they are going to be using voice commands. Show me the setup where you have line of sight to the TV AND the AMP AND the cube is well positioned for voice...
- Volume control - as far as I can tell, voice commands only do a software volume adjustment, but do NOT send an IR command to the Amp. The remote DOES. Why?
- Voice control - strangely, the Cube seems less responsive to voice commands than the echo dot it replaced. Often refusing to pause or mute music or radio, or sometimes pausing momentarily and then insistently resuming playing. I have to believe they are using exactly the same API, right?
- Audio output - The cube should track which components are on/off, and ALWAYS output streaming audio via HDMI once playback has been requested. Timers, announcements etc should only play over the built-in speaker when the Cube thinks the receiver is off.

In short, the hardware functionality is good, the software is a work in progress. It seems like this is a bit of an audio/video Frankenstein mashup and I would hope future software updates will correct some of these issues. For now, it works well enough but I would like those hours of my life back wasted in the tedious setup trial and error.",fair
226,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, 4K Ultra HD, includes latest Alexa Voice Remote",$69.99,4,"I have had many different streaming devices, Fire TV, Roku, Google Chromecast and Apple TV. We gave up Roku's because their remotes were battery eaters and basically featureless. Google Chromecast was okay but nothing worth writing home about. I settled on Apple TV (newest edition) for it's ease of use, simplicity, voice capabilities, sleek remote, expanded memory and consistency of performance with it's Apps. My husband, on the other hand, had several TV's he used and felt the Firestick's price and familiarity were fine for him. I always felt, and still do, that Firestick's interface was way too busy and Apps ran too slow because of the small amount of memory. With recent updates and Apps becoming more bloated, my husband was feeling the pain as well on the Firestick he used in the living room. Both Apple TV and Fire cube were deeply discounted recently but since we could not run two Apple TV's simultaneously in the living room (and my husband was not interested in learning something new anyway), I bought him the Fire cube. The extra memory made a significant dent in opening and operating Apps. The voice control on the cube is very responsive but because we have a major surround sound system we don't use it much ... I don't like yelling out commands while I'm watching TV and we have an Echo in the same room close to us. I suspect Amazon will be releasing an updated cube model perhaps in the fall but this is such an improvement over the Firestick that I doubt my husband would need any more memory or new features. As for me, the GUI of Fire devices is just not appealing so we have his and her devices. Nevertheless, for those who are pleased with Fire TV, this is a nice upgrade even though it's a bit aged. I would definitely look for it discounted and not pay full price.

It's reasonable, considering sales, to compared the cube to Apple TV when one is looking at overall value per dollar spent. This is especially relevant when comparing the cube to the older Apple TV. In my opinion, the cube was a much better deal than the older Apple TV as it had a terrible remote. However the current Apple TV is another thing completely as it runs circles around the cube. If one has never used Apple devices it makes it less attractive especially with it's hefty price tag and it's interconnection preference to Apple hardware. But all this could all change in the near future. If you are an Apple user, are looking for a new streaming device and again see a deep discount on the current generation of Apple TV's, it is definitely worth considering. But if Fire TV is your thing and you need more speed, pick up the current version of the cube on sale. You will be pleasantly surprised.",positive
227,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, 4K Ultra HD, includes latest Alexa Voice Remote",$69.99,2,"Well since voice recognition is on here as a metric I'll start there. You can't really have this and a different echo device in the same room because they will argue with each other over who's job it is to listen to you. Using this as an echo device for voice commands such as ""turn on the lights"" doesn't work as well with this device though because it has to first determine if you're asking it about your light bulbs or trying to find a show to watch. About 40% of the time it's pretty sure you're talking about some show or another and it pauses whatever you were watching and takes you to another screen to show you whatever it thinks it heard instead of turning off the lights so you can enjoy the show you're already watching. This is quite simply a design flaw. It is not difficult to program priority into a device so that it searches for other shows when you're on the home screen and looks for smart commands first when you're already watching a show. The only reason I can think of why it would be the other way around (which it often seems like it might be) is that amazon is hoping you will blunder into some paid content you will then end up buying from them so they can make an extra buck off of you. So, inferior operation of your device on the off chance you might make an extra dollar or two off of the user. Is that really the best way to do it Amazon?

Bluetooth. One of the reasons why I got this device rather than just using the smart functions on my TV is because my TV does not have bluetooth connectivity... not sure why but it doesn't. This device on the other had does have bluetooth and the sound is good and doesn't have a delay on it or anything. However, it does have one little quirk which I find annoying. If you are watching something on prime video you can pick up you're bluetooth headphones, turn them on and the sound switches over seamlessly, but if you're using any other streaming service at the time you get an annoying beep in the ear, the show you're watching pauses, and then the app you're watching it on ""crashes"" ""We are currently unable to display this content"" (or some other such message) forcing you to go find the show you were watching and restart it. While I'm sure amazon would say this is an integration issue on the part of the other apps it feels more like amazon making their products work with the apps you have to pay them for and not working so well with others.

It works and it streams 4k content. I have it hooked up to a gigabit ethernet cable though, and sometimes it lags and has to buffer... not often and just for a couple seconds but for the price I expected better. It is also an amazon device so don't expect to be able to do very much customization without their say so, or to hear back from them if you ask for it. You get what you get and you will like it. They also do the same thing every amazon TV device seems to do and never shut down. Amazon... I wouldn't mind my device taking a few seconds to turn on if it meant that it worked properly every time I sat down to watch something with it. Unfortunately, because of this and one other decision that amazon has made with their devices I frequently need to go into settings go to device management scroll down to restart device and then confirm that after all that yes I do in fact actually want to restart my friggin device. Because, that is the only way to actually close an app and not just minimize it. Amazon. Some apps don't do very well when you minimize them they don't function properly when they haven't been shut down in days or weeks. The combination of these two things means that I usually restart the stupid little box when I'm done watching TV. This would not be so bad except that there is no easy way to do this such as a button on the home screen. Which means that I literally have to push buttons 13 times on my remote to accomplish this and I have to do it either when I'm done watching TV on it or before I start, and sometimes both. I know you do this to make it feel like this inferior little box is fast and works really well, but you've failed. It frequently makes it not work at all. Which in my personal opinion is worse... apparently not for Amazon... If you're going to spend this much on a device just for watching 4k content save yourself the headache and spend an extra couple bucks on a NVIDIA Shield. That's what I'm going to go do now...

Update:
Got my new Nvidia shield today and it is amazing. I can reboot whenever I want and all the apps work flawlessly anyway. The 4k upscaling is amazing I can't believe I thought I was watching in 4k on my fire tv cube. The 4k I see now is noticeably clearer and more crisp. Now I think it's pretty horrible Amazon advertised this product as being 4k capable. Anyway no more updates just buy a shield and save yourself the trouble of trying this piece of junk.",negative
228,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, 4K Ultra HD, includes latest Alexa Voice Remote",$69.99,5,"I needed a streaming device for our dedicated home theater and debated between the Cube and a Firestick. I'm glad I chose this!

The deciding factor was ethernet capability. We have a good mesh wi-fi system, but the home theater is far away from a hub. Since I have ethernet there, I wanted to take advantage. When I set it up, the cube automatically recognized the ethernet connection.

The rest of the setup was a breeze. I especially appreciated the codes I could enter instead of having to enter user name and password like I did with our smart TV in the living room. It took less than 15 minutes to set up the Cube and sign on to PBS Passport, YouTube and Amazon Prime. That included turning off tracking of activity.

An unexpected benefit was voice navigation with Alexa. It makes finding and watching favorites easier. We have new 2 gig fiber and image and sound quality is great. I do have a smart Blu-Ray player in the home theater and I think the Cube gives better IQ and SQ. We still have Dish and you can really tell how compressed the Dish feed is. Watching Nature on PBS really highlights the difference.

This is a whole new world for us, since up to two months ago we only had Dish and Hughesnet as sources in our country home. I'm slowly cutting the cord and transitioning to the wonderful world of streaming. I'm glad I chose the Cube as one of the components in our system.",positive

However, I've been leaning on Alexa to support many smart areas of my home, so I wanted to explore transitioning over to Fire products as some of my Roku devices are starting to break down. I have an older TV that I was thinking about replacing because the Roku devices only do so much. I decided to try the fire cube and I'm so glad I did. It was super easy to setup a speaker group to give a higher end theater experience with my existing alexa speakers and old tv. Plus, the voice capabilities are very effective, and the cube technology even controls my old tv functions. It honestly delivered more capability than I was expecting. I realize that I know my way around the Alexa world, but this setup couldn't have been easier.

On a side note, The speaker grouping that the technology supports is currently limited to a L channel, Right Channel and a Sub. I'm sure it will likely come out soon, but I really want Alexa to support a left/Center/Right/Sub speaker group.... Quit reading this review and just buy the cube!",positive

There is so many options you find for this card after you install your: SanDisk 128 SD Memory Card to your KINDLE Fire. Besides all the options you will have, when you go to check out the card in your ""Apps and Games"" area after it's in, it has it's own area next to: downloaded app, then you will see ""apps that can be movied to the SD Card"" that's built right in so you want need a app to move things to your new card. It show you a list of the apps you have on your system that can be moved to SD card, or not. Some apps are not movable, and that's ok! The ones that are not able to move are not supposed to be moved for the reason, they need to read things out side of the card. Some give you options to move anyways, but will tell you that you will not be able to use widgets and other objects, etc, etc. Just don't get a SD App and try to force things in to the card that shouldn't be moved. I find also that my Kindle Fire is faster adding everything to the card, so that's a big plus, even my browser is faster, but we do use Chrome. The reason you hear that 1-to-2% having problems with this card besides coming to the realization after they buy a 128GB card, and see they could have bought a much smaller one since they had plenty of room to begin with. Most also are not waiting for the card to get everything lined up to work correct. Let me explain: Just like you should give time for the Kindle Fire to load correctly, also give your new card time to load, because besides it getting everything ready for you to use it, and carrying a ton of information at 128 GB, it's also checking to see if there are any other apps that need to be moved as it starts up, etc. It's not just a board with apps pinned to it, there is allot of information it is checking on, and also depends on where you added things from, so it can be checking allot of different areas too, thanks to Kindle Fires Åwesomeness!!! You can tell when it's ready, because the Icons on your desktop will turn dark to normal till it's ready to go, so don't be like the 1-to-2%, be smart, be patient!. Did you ever wonder why there are only a few who complain about objects we buy? Well besides they can't spell correctly? There the one who break things screwing around, because if they can't spell, there sure not going to read, and that makes them not patient enough and they think they must complain to get there money back. Being the CEO of ""MUST HAVE"" Åpps, and Supplies,™ we test ever item for a few weeks inside and out!. We add tons of info, then remove it all, just to add it back in again to see if the card is worthy enough 4Ü! We add all kinds of movies, docs, etc, then check to see how everything came out in the end. The more you use your card, and learn to 're-boot after your last app is installed for that day, the faster your card will be because it's lined up and clean with nothing to stop it. We are just like computers, they need to be rebooted after every download, and so does a Kindle Fire, it needs to be 're-booted after adding anything, and hard-booted if you ever have a problem. If you do not know this, you will be that 1-to-2% with problems because you never took time to read about your KINDLE Fire. That's the first two things you must learn besides cleaning your cache, and making sure you have no malware in your Kindle Fire. These four things are a ""MUST"" TO KNOW, and that way you can give great reviews too when done :-). Also, the reason we say this is for a: Kindle Fire 5TH Gen 10.1 is we tested this card on one. So those with a 5TH Gen who been looking to find the right 128 GB Micro Card, look no further!. Also, we do not get paid for our reviews, we started ""MUST HAVE"" for the people that are too busy in a day to wonder what the best is for there system, or the novice who wants what the pro's use. We take on all the testing for you, it's our way of giving back to the world. We have a major following and get hundreds of letters each week asking for reviews, but I tell them this: If we feel it does not make 5 star, and find the item has problems, we then will not leave a review, we will tell you instead what wrong with the product or app, and leave the review for another since we only do 5 Star items, and you know what? Most say: that's all we want, honesty!. There is always better out in the world of course, but this passed with flying colors and works great for me and my team!!!

231,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Made for Amazon SanDisk 128GB microSD Memory Card for Fire Tablets and Fire -TV,$14.50,5,"Only two weeks in, but the memory card seems to working great.

I got this card for my kindle as it was specifically recommended by Amazon, and my kindle came with only 8 gigabytes of storage, which is ridiculously insufficient for any modern complex operating system expected to accumulate data. Even worse, it's not really 8 full gigabytes. (Also, I got tired of being nagged about running out of space after taking only a few dozen photos.)

Computers like numbers that are in powers of 2, and work best with processors and RAM that are built on powers of 2, which is why you usually see numbers like 8, 16, 32, etc. and not ""strange"" numbers like 10, 21, 43, etc. For this reason computer systems have *traditionally* used 1024 (2^10) as a base when reporting storage usage in kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, etc.

When it comes to a physical storage medium, however, capacity does not have to be a power of 2; it can be whatever number of storage positions will *physically fit*, the only real requirement being that the computer processor can count that high.

Manufacturers are notorious for cutting corners in manufacturing wherever possible then hyping up their products. In the case of the kindle, Amazon used 1000 (10^3) as the base of its ""8 gigabyte"" claim and aimed for a physical arrangement that would guarantee *at least* 8,000,000,000 bytes of storage (1000*1000*1000*8), over half a billion bytes short of 8,589,934,592 (1024*1024*1024*8). Not surprisingly, SanDisk did the same thing with this less-than-32-gigabyte memory card, as this deceptive practice has become an industry standard. But I digress a bit, my point being that an 8-gigabyte kindle affords you with MUCH less storage space than you would expect, necessitating a memory card for expanded storage, especially since the kindle's operating system uses a LOT of overhead, and every application you install also wants to use a lot of storage.

When inserting your new memory card (or removing it) it is best to do so while the device is turned off. Mobile devices are finicky when it comes to ""hot swapping"" memory cards, often refusing to read the card, or even worse, damaging the card and corrupting data.

After you've inserted the card and turned the kindle back on, go to Settings -> Storage, and move all the option sliders to the right to tell your kindle to utilize the memory card as much as it is willing to. Unfortunately, some features will still waste space on the internal storage, e.g. screen captures and blue tooth file transfers will NOT be saved to the memory card.

To ""move"" my kindle books to the memory card, the easiest way was to delete them then re-download them. To move other personal files to the memory card, I connected my kindle to my PC and used Windows Explorer.

From the previously mentioned settings menu, you can also move *some* applications to the memory card. Before and after the move, the amount of storage used on each disk is displayed. Moved applications will still use *some* space on the internal storage, and funnily enough, moved applications use more TOTAL storage than when they resided solely on the internal storage.

One application I did NOT move was ES File Explorer, as this is a system-critical application (due to the kindle's shortcomings).

It should also be noted that the kindle's crappy built-in file browser CANNOT locate the memory card. The files *are* there, but you will NOT find them without a proper file browser like ES File Explorer. Also, some programs (such as the red Notepad) will not be allowed write permissions to the memory card!

A few days ago my wife turned on my kindle and it updated itself which took over half an hour, which seemed unusual because when I observe updates they tend to run much faster. Afterward, my kindle stopped recognizing the presence of the memory card. The solution was to turn off the kindle, remove the card, turn the kindle on, then back off, then reinsert the memory card, then turn the kindle back on.

The card is working great, and is less than 3% full while my kindle has less than 1.5 gigabytes free.

Update 2018-04-23

Last night just before I went to bed, my kindle battery was running low. I was too lazy to go find a charging cable, so I just turned the kindle off.

This morning I turned it back on, with only 12% battery power remaining, and found that several program icons were dark. When I tried to launch one of them, I was told that the program couldn't run because the memory card could not be found! I tried removing the memory card and restarted the kindle like I described in my original review, but the memory card could STILL not be found.

I took the memory card out and connected it to my desktop computer and confirmed that it was in perfect working order. I then put it back in the kindle and connected the kindle to my computer, letting the charge process turn the kindle on. The darkened icons were still dark, and I saw a flash of the memory card icon at the top-left of the screen. I opened ES File Explorer which located the memory card and showed me its files. I went back to the home screen and none of the icons are dark any more.

I guess my piece-of-crap kindle doesn't want to exert any effort accessing the memory card if the battery power is red-lining when the device boots up.",positive

When I powered it up (holding my breath) the screen popped up asking to format the disc. It took all of a couple of minutes from start to finish.

I plugged it into my computer to run first aid on it, I also wiped it and reformatted it as ExFat, which should have worked (it comes as ExFat) but still no luck. Finally, I tried formatting it as MS-DOS (Fat) and for whatever reason, that worked. I put it back into the Fire tablet and now it's mounting and the tablet is reading it and giving me the options for what content should be saved on it. If you're having trouble mounting, give this a try (you'll need a card reader that can read microSD and then just run your disk utility to reformat it). The only problem with this solution is it's not going to allow you to save files larger than 4GB (that's one of the reasons why ExFat was invented). Not sure why an ExFAT formatted drive isn't working on a brand new Amazon Fire tablet. I tried other ExFat formatted microSD cards and they didn't work either.

235,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Made for Amazon SanDisk 128GB microSD Memory Card for Fire Tablets and Fire -TV,$14.50,5,"As SanDisk is a well known brand, I did not do a memory verification test as I trust their memory is correct at 32 gb. I do not really question if the capacity is genuine. During usage, this micro SD card did not get super hot. It did get warm but nothing that is dangerous. That being said, I would say this is safe for use with any device. It can be used with a nintendo switch but be aware 32 gb is a bit on the small side. Most games are really big especially if you are buying them digitally now. It also did not come with an SD card adapter for this one. It will also work with any tablet that has a micro SD card reader. I would use this for my nephew's android tablet. It provides enough memory for some movies and applications (if the tablet supports that). It is also fast enough class to use for running applications without feeling much lag. It is not too noticeable. The transfer speed is not too bad but again it varies based on the medium you are using. This can be pretty good for taking photos or videos. I transferred through the USB 3.0 card reader and it was not bad in terms of reading/writing speeds. I was able to transfer videos at a decent speed but be careful when doing this through your phone as for some reason it gets slow with any SD card. I was able to get everything transferred within an hour. If you are transferring through the tablet however you should expect an extremely long transfer speed. This card does not require any formatting unless you are plugging this into your MAC or tesla because it requires a certain format to transfer things onto the card. If you are going to use this with your tesla, be aware that you will need to format it. It does NOT come with an SD card adapter to allow you to put this into your digital camera. It will work with any SD card adapter if you have it which is great. That being said, the read and writing is pretty good for the most part. Regardless, you may not really notice the lag between shot on your camera. Overall I think this is a good micro SD card. It is a good amount of space and will work for pretty much any device that can utilizes 32 gb, but be aware that 32 gb is not much memory nowadays. The transfer speeds is not bad but be aware it all depends on the medium you are using when transferring. I will say as well that this is great for children's tablets. It allows me to put a good amount videos and such that my niece/nephews may watch as well provide additional room for extra applications (this is all on an android tablet).",positive

First of all, if I could go back I would not have started with Ring. It's not worth the hassle of waiting 30 min to an hour for tech support when you've been on with them for days for the same issue! Over and over. They will warranty the item, but you have to pay for installation again! This camera does what it's supposed to for the most part. I've had to reset all of them a few times which took a couple of hours. Update: I had to go out of town for two days and leave my dog behind at the house with a pet sitter coming in. I was able to watch him in between her visits. I could talk to her through the cameras while she was there. The cameras did their job. It was a much source of comfort for me. I have 2 cameras outside and two inside. One upstairs with the cats and one downstairs with the dog. One at the front of the house and one on the side. A chime notifies me of motion on outdoor cameras. I know when someone is coming down my driveway. The camera sees it and it rings the chime. The dogs have learned that when the chime goes off, someone is coming! It's actually pretty cool. I just wish when there was a problem that it was easier to get a hold of customer support. It's a major downside. I still haven't had the new doorbell installed yet. It was only in for 3 months and it needed replacing. I have to pay another visit from the electrician which wasn't in the budget! I still don't know if I'd buy Ring again. I'd def look into other options first.",positive

I figured with so many features, there had to be something that wouldn't work as expected. But sure enough, it all currently works nearly flawlessly. This is as close to 100% perfection as I'm going to find.

Why did I give it only 4 stars? Maybe I skimmed too much of the product information, but I wanted to use the Echo Show 2 that I purchased separately to monitor the camera feed all day. But I found out that when I had the camera view on the Live stream, it would end the stream after about 10 minutes automatically. I tried to find answers as to what was wrong. Why is it ending the Live stream after this amount of time? I have to keep telling Alexa to show me the camera after 10 minutes. Still can't find the answer to this except that this is just a feature of the system. The official site mentions that it is part of the programming. It is not designed to show the Live feed for longer than 10 minutes straight. I'm stuck with that one little flaw. And this is true with watching it on my iPhone and desktop as well.

But I'm not entirely disappointed because I still love the other features so much and how well they work so far. It's only been 24 hours since I installed it, however. The floodlight senses motion fine and covers more distance than I expected. The clarity in the distance is much better than I expected. The view is much wider than I expected.

242,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus with motion-activated 1080p HD video, White (2021 release)",$159.99,5,"RING Flood Cam Wire Plus review

My order arrived sooner than scheduled. The support from RING has been excellent and they answer the phone 24/7.

I chose the wired unit for reliability and a white one because of our Phoenix Arizona hot sun.

I installed it vertically on the outside wall of my garage, about 8 feet from the floor of the driveway, facing my 2-car driveway and street. I ran a 3-wire round power cord from an AC outlet in the ceiling of the garage – about 15 feet to the wall. Measuring the location of where the unit is to be mounted is VERY important. I carefully calculated where the hole would be drilled through the exterior wall and stucco to the inside of the garage wall. I bought a 12” x 3/8” concrete drill bit and plastic 4” round box.

The hole through the wall had to be reamed out a little for the power cord to easily get through the hole, a 7/16” or ½” bit would have been better. After drilling the hole through about 13” of stucco and wood for the extension cord, I cut the plug off and poked it through to the outside. I mounted the 4” plastic round box with long screws, stripped the cord and 3 wires and wired it up per instructions.

The next morning, I discovered one of two tabs broke off on the plastic 4” round box and the unit was hanging with only the wire and the bottom tab. DO NOT USE A PLASTIC 4” Round Box. I bought a metal 4” round box and rewired and remounted the unit onto the wall. Be sure to use proper screws for mounting the 4” Round Box to the wall or surface.

The unit is very heavy and there are only 2 tabs on the round box to attached it to whatever surface its being mounted on. The metal 4” Round Box with ½” threaded outlets comes with the screw plugs for the holes that will not be used.

The panhead screws that came in the unit for mounting the metal bracket to the round box were too high and did not allow the unit to seal completely with the foam rubber gasket against the 4” round box. I used two Truss-head screws. Again, the unit is heavy, so be very careful when handling and mounting it.

I sealed the 4” round box to the stucco wall with liquid nail to prevent rain from getting into the power cord and into the back of the unit. I painted round box and touched up the stucco.

Now the functions and performance… I’m disappointed in the resolution of the image when zoomed in to enlarge the image of a person. The camera apparently does not have lenses, so the depth of field is very small. The feature to physically select the motion detect area is nice. The app is a little confusing to use but after playing with it, it’s works fine. The on-off selectable motion alarm is interesting. It has a recorded female voice that says “Hi, you are currently being recorded” when the motion detect is triggered.

Overall, this unit is well worth the price and the time to install it. It has provided a nice level of comfort for added outside home security and links with my RING doorbell. I will know more about its environmental quality after a couple summers and rainy seasons. I subscribed to the Plus option for $100/year with video recording of all devices at home. I get shared neighborhood alerts on security issues that RING products detect which is nice to know what is happening around our area.

Customer Feedback to RING: I suggest you revise your installation video to state to only use a Metal 4” Round Box and replace the panhead screws with a flatter head screw. Also, the resolution with a zoomed in image is very important for visual identification. Please improve this in future revisions of this product. I would pay extra for improved resolution.",positive

I did a lot of research over a few days and read countless reviews in order to find the perfect options for my household. I was going to go back to ADT but they were booked up and couldn’t come around for a “quote” for three weeks, so I opted to try the Ring Floodlight with camera. Because we live on the end of the street next to the Bayou (maybe 25ft. from our house) that opens up into the lake, it is really dark and we are secluded from everyone and everything, which is perfect for criminals. At night, it’s pitch black outside and you can’t even see your hand In front of your face much less anything else. The Ring floodlight has eliminated the darkness. I’ve been using it for about a month now and my family loves it !! When it detects motion, it automatically turns the lights on at night on and starts recording. During the daytime, it just records so you don’t waste the light. I love that when I hear the unique chimes that I can check what’s going on at my house while I’m at work. We feel so much safer and I notice less traffic coming down our street since we’ve ordered them. I thought it would be a hassle to set up since I knew I’d be the one to do it but it was as easy as I was informed it would be. I am thrilled with this purchase and can’t wait to order more items from Ring to complete our home security safety!! By the way, a few nights ago I was coming in the house after getting off work and it instantly started recording since it sensed my presence. I looked around before getting out of my car and didn’t see a thing. Watching the video clip the next day at work, it showed a deer in the background. That’s how good the lighting, night vision is.

Camera works pretty well in daylight and at night. I have no complaints about the hardware and quality! The lights can be adjusted from very bright, to just over dim, and have a good range of motion.

I use my echo as a hub fro my ring devices, So no need to buy a ring hub if you have the right echo. This will also allow you to control the lights and view the camera within the Alexa app which is a nice feature. (Although you have to give the Alexa app access privileges to your microphone)

After adjusting the sensitivity i still get way more notifications then when the Trial was active so i wonder what’s up with that and if it’s some scheme to get me to buy the ring Protect. 😡

At this price, you should have the option to record locally instead of paying for their service. Security cameras are pretty much useless without having the recordings 🤷🏽‍♂️

I wish it would integrate with Apple and allow shortcuts to be used: “Turn on the Floodlights” or allow a widget so you can see the video feed without having to open the app

If you want to use this within the Alexa app, you have to allow Alexa microphone permissions.",positive

1) no ability to set a package zone for packages left at my back door...only available on doorbell cameras

2) when motion happens in separate zones, was hoping the zone name would be in the alert. I care more about one zone than the other.

3) the AI needs to recognize the members of the household so as not to flood alerts with ""person at the back door"" when it's me - whether I'm coming home from an errand or out there grilling dinner. Too much noise, but i don't want to disable alerts for when it's not me.",positive

250,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Ring Chime Pro,$59.99,4,"This is a great option for anyone that is thinking of purchasing a ring doorbell, and you do not have any Echos. I picked this up for my bedroom where I did not have the Echo placed. Here is a quick pros/cons breakdown:

Pros:
- Great way to add a chime to a Ring doorbell in rooms that you may not be able to hear other chimes
- If you are familiar with Amazon products such as the Echo or Ring, you will find this pretty easy to set up.
- It plugs right into the wall so it does not take up table space like an Echo
- Built in night light that is not too bright.

Cons:
- If you already have Echos in every room, you really do not need this.
- It is not very loud, so if you are watching TV or wearing a headset, you may end up missing the chime

These were just a few things I found while using mine. It works good in quieter areas such as my bedroom. It is just loud enough for me to hear, but not loud enough to wake me up. Personally, I use my Echos more for my chime, so I would only recommend this for someone that is looking to put this in areas where an Echo is not present or cannot be placed.",positive
251,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Ring Chime Pro,$59.99,4,"Whenever working with a ring salesperson or technical support, they seem to always want to upsell you items. I believe that my problem is still a faulty ring camera but I'm willing to try the chimes. I was very concerned that it would not work with my existing doorbell which is mechanical. After asking the technician to look it up for me I was told that it would not. After trying it out and setting everything up, I found that the technicians response was incorrect and it does work with my mechanical doorbell as well as the electronic chime. I had originally moved my router right next to my doorbell and I still could not get a stronger signal. After installing the ring chime Pro and having to reset it several times, it finally began to work and I do have a stronger signal. Time will tell if it was coincidental or not, but I really wish that I did not have to attach it. I'm leaving well enough alone for now, but I still believe I have a somewhat faulty ring camera and it should be receiving my Wi-Fi signals much stronger especially when it's only 2 ft away, and finally about 15 ft away.",positive
252,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Ring Chime Pro,$59.99,4,"To start off, the Chime Pro works as intended. We had a nutone intercom system which I had to disable to install our Ring Doorbell. This also meant the original doorbell chime system stopped working. This item works as described to help remedy that. Installation and set-up was a breeze as it is pretty much ready out of the box.

As my title said, I'm not very impressed with the Pro version. I may have been better off getting two Non-pro Chimes for better sound coverage and similar cost. While it is fairly loud, I wouldn't trust just one unit for a large home.

Along with linking Alexa devices to also chime when someone presses the doorbell, you can easily get the coverage you need with just one unit on the main floor. However, I'll be looking to add more when I find a sale.

All in all, this is a waste of money if your existing doorbell chime is working well. For those that do need more sound coverage, this works as intended. I would, however, look into the other chime variations. One of the benefits of the Pro version is that it extends the wireless signal so your other Ring devices can get a better signal (though this was not an issue for me).",positive
253,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Ring Chime Pro,$59.99,5,"I have been using ring products for a few years now. Essentially 6 indoor cams and a ring elite door bell. All the cameras monitor the interior of my home only and are on a 5G network. I found that only my doorbell had an issue connecting to my router which was kind of site. Sure I can get an ultra strong WiFi signal down at my mailbox, but ring secretly has their hands on my doorbell and won’t let it connect without dropping out. But most will say it’s the concrete wall it’s attached too. I say wrong as I tested a WiFi cam mounted next to it and it worked perfect. So yeah, something stinks there. I believe, and I have said it before, the WiFi transmitter/receivers in some ring devices are horrible, and that’s all I’ll say about that.

I had the old chime pro, yep it had its issues after awhile and that’s why I bought this one. Not only did this one jump on the network without an issue, it’s so much better than the old one. Now, I’m sure it was made on a Wednesday, since I have heard some peeps have issues with them, but the signal strength is way better than it’s predecessor. I’ll bet there is different processors in them as I’m sure parts change without telling us, then we do firmware updates and tons of peeps chime pros fail while others work perfect. Again, outdated gear can’t handle some updates and fail. I guess I’m fortunate that the one I got works great. Trust me, a power outage has caused some ring cameras to stop working for weeks, then they just start up again. Thankfully I rely on my NVR and POE cams for everything else. I just don’t trust WiFi cams without a super strong mesh network and radios that will bounce a signal with zero failure. Ring isn’t at that level and maybe someday they will be, but for now, it’s an easy fix.",positive

That way when someone rings my doorbell 4, I hear the ring from my chime pro. I don't like the default doorbell 4 chime so the chime pro offers a lot of different chime options.

256,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Ring Chime Pro,$59.99,5,"I first bought a Ring doorbell cam 4 and hard wire installed it. RSSI signal strength was around -65 which was ok but not good. Because RSSI is a negative number, the lower number the better. For example, the best RSSI is -59 to -1. I then bought the Ring Chime Pro and installed it in a wall outlet between the router and the doorbell. The app said, no good, find a different location. I tried three more locations, including a wall outlet inside the house located only about 8 feet from the outside doorbell. Signal strength still not good. Finally, I used an extension cord and located the Ring Chime pro on top of a dresser that is literally one foot from the doorbell, with only the house's outer wall between the doorbell cam and the Ring Chime Pro. At first, still no good! I felt defeated. But wait, there is more! I checked on it a couple of hours later and all of a sudden, the RSSI was great, it was -44.

My conclusion is that do not be thrown off by an initial bad reading. Apparently it takes awhile either to establish the good connection and/or the Ring cam device only updates the signal strength report every so often. So now I conclude that it is possible that some of the other locations I tried may also work. To adequately test each location, I believe you need to install it and let it sit there for awhile. In the Ring app, go to the Ring doorbell cam settings, click on ""Device Health"" to see the current RSSI value, but also scroll down and to see the date and time of the last ""Device Health Check."" If that time is a couple of hours ago, do something to the doorbell cam to trigger it, like ring the doorbell, and then check device health again. I did this and the RSSI value changed for the better.

It has now been over a week, and I am consistently getting an RSSI from the router to the Ring Chime Pro, and from the Ring Chime Pro to the Ring cam, of about RSSI-45, which is great.

Other things: As other reviewers have noted, you truly can easily turn off the nightlight, the chime alerts, and even the little blue status light. In other words, you can easily make the Ring Chime Pro a completely dark and silent device whose only purpose is the signal strength boost. This is all I wanted because my doorbell cam is hard wired to my mechanical doorbell chimes and I don't need any part of it except the signal boost.

Thus I give five starts to the Ring Chime Pro. I have not yet reviewed the Ring doorbell cam itself, but my comment on that is that if you have a brick house, like mine, and your doorbell is in a corner far away from your router, you will probably need to also pay $49 for the Ring Chime Pro, unless you already have a system of mesh wifi boosters.

Also, the Ring Chime Pro is super easy to install. Assuming you have already installed the Ring app on your phone, you just plug the Ring Chime Pro into a wall outlet. Then you do have to wait a few minutes while the app sends a firmware update to the device. After that, the app will start giving you prompts that the location is no good. But if you feel the location is pretty good, I would wait, as described above, and see if the signal strength improves over time.",positive

259,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Ring Chime Pro,$59.99,3,"I have an 1100 sq ft house. My router is in the bedroom that is in the middle of my house. When the power goes out or the internet drops, my doorbell and side camera have difficulty reconnecting. Either I have to remove them so I can hit the reset or I do what I have just gotten accustomed to.....just wait a few days for them to reconnect themselves. I looked at this thing because it was supposed to extend my wifi signal and my hopes that I wouldn't have so many issues with my outside cameras. It didn't do anything really. It took forever to connect to my wifi, kept saying that it needed to be closer to the router. At one point, it was literally next to the router. I can't gripe too much I guess since I was trying to connect it to the 2.4ghz signal of a hidden network. I only tried connecting to the 2.5 because my doorbell and camera used the 2.4. Anyway, I tried the 5ghz connection and after a few attempts, it connected. Awesome, now the connection to my 2 outside cameras will be better.....no. While this is what is advertised ""Extend your wifi signal up to 2000 sq ft to boost the network for all your Ring doorbells and cameras."", it definitely does not boost the signal very much. While I am disappointed that it doesn't do what is promised, I am able to use these cameras on the 5ghz network through the Chime and they both reconnected when 1. the power went out and 2. the internet dropped momentarily during a storm.

It does connect the cameras to it, but don't get it thinking that it will boost your signal the advertised 2000 sq ft.",fair
260,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Kindle - Now with a Built-in Front Light - White,$64.99,1,"I think Amazon has many Kindle e-Reader users who use their e-Readers every day, have thousands of volumes on their Kindles, purchase multiple e-books per week, read several thousand words per minute, and who often encounter more “You purchased this item on ...” in their frequent e-book browsing on Amazon.

I know these users are disappointed with Amazon’s recently updated Kindles because I am one. I read many thousands of words per minute, had thousands of books on my Kindle, and purchase 20 to 30 books a month. I purchased my first paper back from Amazon in September 1995 and my first Kindle book in December 2011. I was disappointed with my 4th Kindle purchase, at 10th Generation, in February 2022 & my 5th today, a used 8th Generation.

First, its screen touch event handling was buggy, often requiring 10 to 40 taps, and sometimes many hard thumb thumps to move to the next page. Worse, periodically after a long series of thumps it would flip page after page after page, frequently 50 or more pages, requiring a long backward search for my last read page. This unbelievably frustrating defect caused my reading speed to fall by more than half.

Second, it repeatedly lost my book sorting options. At first I had to reboot the Kindle to enforce my desired sort option, but finally after an reset I only had to flip between the sort options to keep my books sorted as I desired.

Third, the 'most recent' sorting option failed its book positioning, e.g., when you opened a book it did not move it to the first page of your library nor did it reposition you in your library.

On March 16, 2022 Amazon installed a new version of software of my 10th Gen Kindle without my permission and later they did the same thing on a used 8th Gen Kindle. At 8AM on the March 16th I opened my 10th Generation Kindle E-Reader planning to return to my prior night's reading, instead I was invited to a new Kindle experience. After hitting NEXT-NEXT-NEXT more times than I could count and controlling my temper enough not to smash my Kindle into the wall I got to my library. Amazon had replaced the paged library entries with the scrollbar used on tablets and phone Kindle apps. A user interface I despise since it makes it impossible to review libraries with few hundred books. I have thousands. It is one reason I seldom use the Kindle app on my phone. A critical difference, however, is that this e-reader still has the touch event handling bugs, making the new scrollbar worse than useless.

Anyone with any experience knows using scroll bars to navigate thousands of entries is an exercise in madness. And without scrolling keys extreme insanity. For example, consider the sorted 59 item 2-letter postal scroll bar for the US’s 50 states and 9 territories. Those from Montana, even the hunt-and-peck typists, undoubtedly feel frustrated hitting 'M' once and the down arrow 9 times to get to MT to pick your 2-letter state abbreviation with this scrollbar. After all, even hunt-and-peck typists from Montana probably have the location of the 'T' memorized.

Before I scrolled down 1 page with this new interface it opened 2 long, 1,000+ page books I'd completed just days before. I had to wait for each download and open to complete, because I didn't see a cancel cross by the download like the previous version had, but I may have missed it because I was blind with rage by then. Worse, with this new scrollbar interface I could not find the book I was reading the night before. The most recent book I was reading. The book I wanted to resume reading when I picked my Kindle that morning. That book was not shown on the scrollbar!

The prior version had a “GO TO PAGE” popup you reached by tapping the page number allowing me to find unfinished books easily, but that isn’t there anymore. Remember, Kindle E-readers do not have keyboards, no page up or down buttons, no scroll up or down keys. You must control everything include this new scrollbar with one finger on a screen that, has we know from my first complaint above, does not have good event controls.

Now suppose you have a 2,000 item library that with the old Kindle display was spread over 400 pages and you knew that page 200 has your oldest unfinished books. Before 3/16/22 I only took five taps to get to any page between 100 or 400, but on my phone with the Kindle app’s scrollbar it took several minutes of fast finger flicking to fly through my library without looking at a title to reach that last page. And the phone’s Kindle app downloaded 3 titles on the finger scrolling efforts. Now Amazon has made this user interface standard across all Kindle platforms!

Once you have a scrollbar widget, it's tempting and easy to dump everything into it. However, my old X-widget and HTML programming manuals from the mid 1980s clearly say scrollbar menus should be easily keyed and not be long, e.g., keyed like state abbreviation codes with no more than 60 items. The manuals all recommended partitioned, multi-level menus to handle more items. The manuals were written by the creators of these user interfaces at Xerox Park, UC Berkley, and Bell Labs.

Now Amazon’s software engineers have put 2,000 items in a most recently accessed sort with no possible entry key. This is software engineering at its worst; I have not seen such poor software engineering in many, many decades. And it says a lot about how Amazon currently views its Kindle E-Reader customers that they'd release this poorly engineered user interface. Somehow I feed an Android/Google cabal at Amazon has take

Amazon probably will not fix any of these defects because Amazon has clearly made a conscious decision to abandon a solid user interface to reduce programming costs by using the same software across all devices supported by Kindle. I do not think Amazon is just trying to reduce Kindle support costs here. The Kindle e-Reader is what gave Amazon its dominance in the e-book market. I think an executive cabal is convinced the Android platform is best for users. Well, that cabal will hurt Amazon's e-book market.

An Amazon consultant suggested I use the Kindle’s “Collections” feature to organize my books. Now I used this feature on my last Kindle, but I could not find those collections on the new one. Maybe they were there, but hidden. My previous collections were narrow ones anyway: “BORING”, “RAMBLES”, “STUPID”, and “BAD.”

How should I arrange 2,000 volumes? 20 collections of 100 books each? 16 collections of 125 books each? 25 collections of 80 books each? What criteria should I use to make a collection? How about by year purchased? But then my most recent years would have hundreds of entries Besides, I once checked some of my “STUPID” collection and found out Amazon no longer sold some of the e-books. So I doubt I can even find out when I purchased all my e-books. No matter how I arrange these books I would encounter scrollbar menu overload searching my library. I prefer my original use of collections: “STUPID and BAD.”

Regarding the title of this review, since 2011 as I became more and more sucked in by my good Kindle experiences, I've given away many thousands of hard copy books to libraries and charities. Amazon sucked me into believing they would only improve my Kindle experience, not screw it up. After 27 years as an Amazon customer and 11 as a Kindle user they made it FUBAR -- FOULED UP BEYOND ALL RECOGNITION.

Now I'm sorry I gave away all that reading material. I cannot take my Mac to bed and I only use the Kindle smart phone app as a last resort. I've had to dug up my old night reading light and taken to wandering into used book stores. Amazon clearly doesn't care about its longtime customers anymore and has tossed human factor engineering in the trash.

I’ve returned both Kindles and I wish I could get the monies I put into a gift card account for e-Book purchases back, but I cannot. I cannot put up with such poor human factors engineering on the part of Amazon. Until March 16th I had 4 years of continuous daily use of my Kindle and bought 4 or more e-books per week. Both streaks have ended and the phone, tablet, and PC apps have many more intolerable bugs than the Kindle e-Reader.

For 11 years Kindle e-Readers provided me great reading experiences. Now I will not pay for an e-reader that provides a worse reading experience than the free Apps on my phone or tablet. Perhaps Amazon intends to drop this e-Reader.",negative
261,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Kindle - Now with a Built-in Front Light - White,$64.99,5,"It’s year 2022 and I’m finally switching from paper to digital books. Which means that this is my first ever kindle device. I have to be honest, I’ve always though that owning a reading device like a kindle is useless and too modern-agey. I do enjoy buying and reading aged and used books, as opposite to brand new, because it brings back precious memories of borrowing library books with well read pages that always had a mystery about them. Now until I received a used book full of yucky tobacco smell that I could not air out (and I tried different methods) and not until I had the need to downsize, that I actually decided to obtain a kindle. I already had the kindle app on my phone, and on my tablet- so why would I need a kindle device if I could just read from my phone or tablet?? - Mainly because I was curious about it, I decided to take a chance and test it and decide if I wanted to keep it or not.
So I got the Kindle, and big surprise .. it’s b&w and it’s not technologically advanced (lucky me - I still breathe in pre-y2k vibes so what better thing to have than a brand new old school-like device, with solid plastic exterior (kind of like a children’s toy) I love it! So now onto reading books… well it couldn’t be better!! I no longer need to hold my heavy phone or even heavier tablet and to torture my eyes with their bright lights while I read! The kindle is so light and it only takes me the slightest touch to turn the page! My reading experience now is so serene and enjoyable that it has helped tremendously with insomnia, adding tranquil time to my life, and bonus - I can take it to the beach and read in the sun! Even the ads on the screensaver don’t bother me - they’re black and white after all, and they’re only about books. The touch screen “glitches” also do not bother me at all.. It’s like being on another planet and catching signals from the Earth on a strange device - my life is definitely more intriguing with a kindle than without it, so I’m keeping it! My final thought about owning a kindle is, that you would either love it ❤️ or hate it 💔",positive
262,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Kindle - Now with a Built-in Front Light - White,$64.99,5,"I'm a long time kindle user. My favorite to read on is the 9th gen oasis (I have a 10th gen, but the case isn't quite as perfect) I used to wear cargo pants everywhere to carry it.

Anyhow, I've stopped wearing cargo pants for aesthetic reasons, so it had gotten harder to take my oasis everywhere. The last straw was last week I went on an airplane trip and forgot my kindle entirely. I had to read for like five hours on my cellphone. this was a miserable experience. So as soon as airplane mode was turned off, I ordered a kindle next-day to my hotel room. It felt like a kind of extreme luxury? haha. I do talk about the kindle as a 'luxury reading device' - it is rather more expensive than actual books, if you don't count storage space.

I mean, I was already being a bit silly and, well, what is the word? profligate? I have like four kindles at home. So I bought the cheapest kindle available; something I haven't done in a decade.

It is really nice. I mean, yes, you don't get quite as many pixels, but it fits in typical pockets of typical (men's) jeans. This is a huge game-changer for me! I'm back to carrying my kindle everywhere!

It also has a pretty nice light. (the last time I had a cheap kindle, you had to buy a case that connected to electronic contacts on the kindle that could then power a completely external light that would bother people if you were reading in dark environments)",positive
263,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Kindle - Now with a Built-in Front Light - White,$64.99,5,"At one time there were several slight variations of the 10th Generation e-reader. Mine is the Kindle 3 Basic 10th Generation model G091 0L0 (4 or 8 GB versions were offered when I bought it two years ago, now I see only the 8GB)

My only complaint is lack of wired headphone jack. I couldn't care less about water proofing beyond it not actually being made of paper which would get soggy. There should be a product fork in this model for those who actually read while swimming.

About storage: I have the 'no longer offered' 4GB version of this device. The two years I've had it I've never read more than 4 books at the same time and never had a single book that in Kindle format needed 4GB of storage even with a few audibles I've never ran into storage issues. In fact, I currently am only using 668MB of the 2.75GB of storage I have left after system files. Just don't download your entire library at once. I have several titles on this device currently - all with audible and only 668MB of ram is being used (keep in mind that the novels I read have few to no actual images beyond the book cover art, and are typically 500 to 900 pages in length.)

About durability: I carry this thing around in the hip pocket of my cargo pants dead of summer. it had riden in the same pocket as my car keys and so it's lightly scratched but has fared to the abuse extreemly well though I did take care to keep the keys on the case back side and never allowed too much pressure on the screen (this wasn't a serious concious effort) and two years later for all of that the battery still holds up and the screen is flawless.

This device was a great concept over actual tablets and smartphones for it's purpose. The only future improvements I could possably think of is response time of menu selections could be snappier. But it's very tolerable as is so it wouldn't be worth sacrificing battery life or heat resiliance to improve it. And I would like the old fashioned head phone jack back. Paring the same headphone to multiple devices can be a head ache as you switch around. Head phones that simply plug and play are so much simpler to deal with (no digging into system menu options, just plug and go) The only reason I would buy an updated model is if it had a 10"" screen. to me, it wouldn't justify spending more than $200 because to spend more than that demands more in terms of functionality than reading books. As is, if I bust it up in my pocket or forget it somewhere it's just $60. Forget it and buy another - at this price it's more expendable.",positive
264,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Kindle - Now with a Built-in Front Light - White,$64.99,5," This is my first kindle. I've been a ""love the feeling of the page turning"" kind of gal forever. But lately I've noticed I'm reading less and it's because transporting books is difficult. They're big/heavy, so you have to limit your selections. Whichever one I pick to bring somewhere often ends up being the one I don't want to read and instead I wish I brought the other ones. My love of reading surpasses my love of feeling the page turning. So I began thinking about an e-reader.

During prime day, these go on sale so I got this model, the cheapest and most basic one, just to try it out. I'll say that the kindle subscription is actually fairly nice, and when setting up the kindle, take advantage of the free trial (whether or not you choose to continue it, it's nice to have for free). My trial is 3 months long, but I believe this varies depending on the current deals. I also got a month free for audible with two book credits, even though I'm not a new member to audible. I thought this was really cool, and all these free trials/books nearly offset the cost of the kindle.

So far I love this kindle. It's REALLY lightweight, which I appreciate. It's responsive. When the kindle is in sleep mode, you can choose to have the book you're currently reading as the sleep mode Lock Screen, which is a thoughtful touch and makes it feel more book-like.

The screen is truly anti-glare. I live in Alaska and it's summer so the sun is about 10ft away from me around 4pm. And still no glare. The anti-glare screen also does have a nice feel, reminiscent of paper.

Turning the kindle on takes no more than a few seconds. It's not instant like most devices now, but it's by no means slow.

Also while reading you can look up words, which is a nice feature to have while reading more difficult texts and expanding your vocabulary.

Lastly a pro that has to be mentioned is that you can borrow library ebooks/audiobooks from the app libby, and send them to your kindle. These books are free and will return on their own once your reservation period is up. There's wait times for some so leave notifications on so you don't miss the books you've waited months for.

All of this is in other reviews so I'll skip to the downsides of this basic model.

1) there's no dark mode. I didn't even think about this not being a feature when I ordered. I wrongfully assumed that by now, all new devices would have dark mode. But this device does not. There will only be white page with black text. I've read about dark mode with e-readers and overall even devices with the dark mode feature leave the user wanting more. I guess the anti-glare screen technology makes it difficult to also have a crisp/clear dark mode? But I'm no expert, this is just what I've seen in my research.
Now although there's no dark mode, I do find that I can read this at night in bed in the dark. The brightness levels can be turned down so low that it's not straining on the eyes. The lower brightness settings also seem to have a warmer tone to the white background which is helpful when reading at night also.

2) if you do anything but read, the navigation is fairly slow and not intuitive. this device is great as an e-reader, that's what it was built for is to only load a page once in a while. loading web graphics quickly? not so much. the video I've attached shows a reference of the navigation while reading & turning pages.

TL;DR this is a very simple e-reader but has all the things to make it a great one.",positive
265,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Kindle - Now with a Built-in Front Light - White,$64.99,1,Horrible knew kindle. Have to tap 4-5 times to get it to next screen on old kindle I bought 1 tap next screen comes up. This kindle way too smaller than older kindle. No indication what % you’ve read so far or bottom left corner tells you now mins you how many mins until chapter ends. Just all words not even a page # your on. Go into settings nothing at all to adjust something. Already returned first that shows below kindle these cases for it. This one kindle just falls out abt 1/4” too big. That retuned. Spent 30 mins with rep. He has no idea if 2018? Any year. Nothing on kindle or box it came abt what year what generation. Spent 30 mins on phone with rep to find any case that at least with be snug enough so kindle just doesn’t fall out at all. Told him I chose first case that was right under this kindle many cases right below. Doesn’t know year of kindle. Only this is a 10th generation one. Is that the correct for whatever year or generation or is? Abt 15 mins I’m waiting for him to find what model even. And what year made? My older one the cases showing below it had the size this kindle snapped right into case. Comes back and tells me 10th generation the kindle is. Are you sure! Yes. Waiting more. So you even have a item # anything thing this ‘one’ item #? Has no clue what an item number is. Number starts with BM. Ok if only 1 case can I just enter in search only BM and more come up. Yes Call ends. Enter number same case I just returned is the first case already in process to return. There is one in all purples swirled. I order the one because now this one says kindle paper white at least with 10th generation on what kindle will snap in snug at least too small kindle won’t just drop out if just holding kindle up. This one arrives and same thing. Kindle still just drops out. Omg. This one already processing return again and get money back. This kindle i just processed to return and be done with it. Even if you just Google ‘kindle’ all links always Amazon anything kindle. Target and Walmart only black cases and white ones. Because Amazon has the monopoly on more all kindle and more choices of cases than any store. I want to Site for Best Buy the some different color cases at least I’m not just black or white ones. At least I’ll be in a store with a sales rep that will find not a $200 one next prices that just jump and go to over at least starting from $125 next coat up from this $89 one this one was i bought. Ok must be at least close to basic even with tap once to get to next screen and same % so far and how many mins left to end of chapter. I had googled how do I know what year or generation or even model this one is. Settings in more kindle year or Anything info to find it. I go into the info and it’s everything else. How many giga bites etc nothing else even showing 2019-even 2020 at lease 2020. Just horrible way too small all cases for it same exact size of what even the size it’s supposed to snap this kindle in snug. Etc etc. all my off day and at least mins of it spent with a rep. Totally clueless holding and holding waiting for any rep to take the call. And of course this one has a heavy accent probably in India or Pakistan. No wonder why I had a hard time very articulate I am and he doesn’t know over and over I keep giving same info. More wasted minutes. I think Amazon too with a huge warehouse one maybe 25 mins from me. And so many in America. Shame on Amazon to outsource customer service now out sourced the work when so many who do need a job right here and real American citizens who speak English clear and no so beyond even speaking with heavy accents in another country. I had a hard time eden under understanding me when my only main language is English. Another huge multi million dollar corporation. Just sucking up more money all the time. I remember when millions of us way back would hear there’s this site called Amazon and it’s supposed have a lot of things and with lower prices too. Then even Best Buy etc does. I stopped using Amazon maybe 3-4 yrs ago when some many things now are shipped from another country. Product lost up to over 2-3 weeks past maybe yes delivers by Date. One lost on shipping dock somewhere in China showing green I stock in America. I ordered a pretty light raincoat for not cold rainy day. Green in stock yeah sure. I already ask for credit back 1 month after 2 weeks? On Amazon ware house showing it’s in stock in America. It never even came at all. Good thing I did know maybe lost in another country or will never arrive even after 5 months if it arrives and I was smart enough this time. When tracking shows should be maybe 5 days it will definitely arrive. This is what’s going on with all companies who even became the biggest in maybe 3 yrs even Facebook! When before that is was MySpace. When even 12 yr olds had so much fun talking to only kids around same age. Then Facebook just lets anyone on. Men 40 yrs old pretending to be 13 and even pic etc looks like a 13 old boy. And 11-13 yr old girls all 3 going back and forth because this ok 13 yr old boy! Seems pretty cool and a good kid etc. just saying things he does a 13 year old boy would do. Then has more only one of this 12 yr old girls convos with her telling her things on so cool she is etc why don’t we meet at a McDonalds have something to eat. Then girl is missing for days. Until they find her dead in a ditch. And I was on of millions who got Amazon so high and mighty now. Treating all millions of us who got Amazon from the ground up. I check Amazon and then even Walmart and target. Same exact time on Amazon only at least $5 less. Even better and go into a store and there it is only more colors etc to choose from. And if I have to return even jeans. Even better. Go back to ‘Store’ and return and just get another 1 size up or down and buy correct size right then. And wow I even got a credit back into my account before back to same rack same style jeans. And many more sizes too. It’s all about just sucking up more money with not even the first years spending so much money to get all of you loaded even more and just don’t give a darn anymore abt real still American ‘citizens’ born raised in American and still living in this country. And all of you money grabbers resourcing out jobs to other countries?’! When so manny real American citizens might need a job just to have a roof over there heads or etc? Maybe all of you and Amazon should take ‘Your’ business out of this country and get the heck out for good. And go to another country and set Amazon up permanently. Then see how much money you’ll get from that country. So we can all see at the most 3 years from then. And all of us in this country still will be the USA #1 country in the country word. And then all of us here will say wow that site called Amazon? Closed down for good! What a shame. Tsk tsk.,negative
266,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Kindle - Now with a Built-in Front Light - White,$64.99,5,"I've had two Kindle's over the course of their existence- the original first gen Kindle and the first gen Kindle Fire. I love both of them, but the OG Kindle battery died ages ago and I never looked into replacing it. My Fire was wonderful when I was in college- I bought a bluetooth keyboard and it replaced my laptop for note taking in class. But it's been relegated to being my 3 year old niece's tablet when she visits. I really just wanted a basic Kindle to read in the evenings or when the power goes out so I'm not staring at the glare of a phone or tablet screen. This one fits the bill. The only thing I miss that I didn't want to pay extra for are the physical buttons to turn the page that the OG Kindle had. I know that just means more things to possibly break/malfunction, but I liked the little tactile ""click"" of the page turn. But I can't complain! This little guy has been great and gotten me through a couple of power outages, a night spent hyperfocusing on D&D Monster Manuals, and my roommate's hair appointment on just one charge. ;)",positive
267,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Kindle - Now with a Built-in Front Light - White,$64.99,4,"Have used a Kindle Fire(2012 version) for reading at work for the last several years, but had noticed the plug for charging was starting to go. I needed a replacement but knew I didn't need a Fire just for reading. I saw this in the deals for Prime Day and decided to take a chance.
I really like the size and weight of this Kindle. The amount of time between charges is still to be determined. I charged it fully when I received it in mid-July and it is still at 50%. I read 20 mins, during my lunch and keep it in airplane mode.
The 2 biggest differences between this and the Fire are that I could turn the Fire and read in landscape mode and the ""smoothness"" of page ""turning"".

I love reading on kindle devices. Also love that I can adjust the font since I am 77 years old. When I got this latest one, I had forgotten how to set it up an connect to a netok. Anyway after setting up, I am very happy. Navigation is tricky at times but instructions pop up along the way.
This kindle was purchased as a bundle with power cord and case. My only negative is that the case is more like a cheap piece of plastic:(. It looks like the kindle could fall out at any time.I purchased the A.C. Dream case to replace it. It cost $15.00 but it's worth it and looks like it will last a long time.

No not scrolling through dozens of books to find the one I want!",positive
269,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Kindle - Now with a Built-in Front Light - White,$64.99,3,"Okay, so I have a lot of good things to say about this device and a lot of bad things.
Let's start with the bad:
-The touchscreen is terrible.
-It is incredibly frustrating to view the table of contents of the book I'm reading or write a note.
Highlighting things is a complete pain to do because it takes me 3 minutes just to highlight a
paragraph. It is slow and non-intuitive. When highlighting, it is very difficult to place the cursors
in between where you want to highlight. I would not recommend this device for any notetaking
whatsoever. After clicking on one spot, it takes at least 2 seconds for the screen to register the
click. Typing for notetaking is very strenuous. You need to type each letter very slowly so that the
board registers it. Also, sometimes you need to swipe multiple times to get the option you want.
For example, if you are reading a book and you want to see how much battery you have when you
swipe, it would either pull up the battery or open the directory for the book.
-There's something wrong with my battery.
- Although this device is said to last four weeks on a full charge. The battery has drained very fast
for me. I usually have to charge it after only two days of use in a low-brightness setting, even
though it is full charge.
Now the good stuff:
-Size:
-It is the perfect size for me. It fits in my pocket, and I can whip it out without too much struggle
and still have a good grip on it. Also, it's easy to read in this size.
-Downloading Books:
-I had no intention of buying any books or using any book subscription with this device. Ive been
downloading books as pdfs and transferring them to my kindle. It's very easy to convert books
with Calibre and incredibly easy to add a book to my collection.
-Easy on the eyes:
-It's very easy to read without feeling any strain on your eyes.
-Reading diagrams or code:
-Even if you're not reading a novel, it is very easy to read math textbooks or coding textbooks. For
example, I've been reading python textbooks on my kindle, and the format and presentation are
perfect. It's probably the best method I have for reading math textbooks because the format isn't
as overbearing as it is on pdf on a computer or on paper. The code also appears very legible and
easy to read.
OVERALL:
I think it is a fantastic device. Although, I don't think I would ever pay full price for it. The touchscreen delay is just so frustrating and is such an essential part, yet it fails to do its job correctly. I bought this device on prime day for $50 and I think that's the max i'd spend. It is incredibly useful for me, but I have several issues that just stick out and make it incredibly difficult to use sometimes.",fair
270,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Blink Add-On Sync Module 2,$34.99,5,"I have a blink doorbell cam and when I installed it and hooked it up to the blink app it mentioned the Blink sync module 2. So I went on amazon and did some research on it and couldn’t really see what it did. I also read a lot of reviews that mentioned that you didn’t need it and some other reviews that said that they had trouble installing it. But, I ultimately decided to buy it and see what it did even though I planned on keeping the cloud storage here is what I have learned.

If you have a blink camera that doesn’t plug in it is a good idea to get this and the cloud storage. The blink sync module 2 takes the video from the blink camera’s that don’t plug in and uploads them to your cloud storage for them. The cloud storage plus plan is about 10.60 a month with taxes and all included as of the writing of this review. And you can use the blink module 2 with just a usb drive but know that if someone breaks into your home and takes the usb drive with them when they leave you will have no photo’s or video of who was in your home.

Because the video of the break in was not uploaded to the cloud and stored off site.

So what happens with the devices from blink that use batteries (this can apply to solar powered devices as well) is that they try to conserve their energy so the best way that they do that is to only upload to the cloud as needed. Meaning without the module they are only uploading pictures, and (in my experience) no video.

So when they do have the module they are communicating with it via wifi and saying ""Hey I saw something and it needs to go to the cloud (if you have it) but I dont want to waste my power can you do it for me?” and the sync module responds back and says “sure im plugged in and I have plenty of power give it to me and I will send it”. The camera then send the video to the module (using a lot less power) then sends the video to the cloud storage (that you can pay for yearly or monthly) and it is saved.

I think that the sync module 2 is nice, but I also think that they can do a better job on this site. They need to explain exactly what the module does and what will happen if you don’t get the cloud storage and what will happen if you do.

I personally believe in redundancy when it comes to things like this and I think that if you are going to have this security system it is best to have the cloud storage, and to use a thumb drive. But if you really want to have just a thumb drive and you need this to do it I would suggest hiding this device somewhere where it will not be seen and where thieves cant get to it. Like one reviewer said it would be nice to be able to use this with an Ethernet cable, but you cant. Which is something that I don’t like other than that I would buy it and my blink doorbell camera again.

That’s my two cents sorry about the long review. I hope that this helps you make a good decision about your home security needs. I did the best that I could so if it is a little confusing I am sorry.",positive
271,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Blink Add-On Sync Module 2,$34.99,5,"I purchased this camera to protect my office while away because I have a lot of computer equipment in my office. I combined the purchase with a Add On Sync Module 2 and 64 gig USB memory. The daytime picture is very clear, colorful, and real time, the night vision is also excellent. I combined the sync module with access to my Wi-Fi and the Blink application on my phone. The response time when motion is detected is very quick and I can get a signal all the way down to Florida traveling, and I live in Griffin Georgia. I was concerned that the power cord would be not long enough but is provided with a 5 foot cord and a USB power adapter.

Bueno talvez en youtube este la solución o la comunidad la genera pero para mi es absurdo que una compañía que te busca enganchar con un sistema de suscripción tenga un servicio tan deficiente, menos mal que te mandan la cámara y todo viene integrado pero no es así te cobran por un sistema de suscripción para después no ofrecerte mas nada a tema de soporte, repulsivo método de negocio, lastima que ya perdí el dinero, pero espero que ustedes no pierdan el tiempo y dinero en este producto o cualquiera de la familia Blink y no es que la cámara sea mala, para el precio esta bien, pero el soporte técnico es asqueroso, porque me parece casi insultante la forma en la que abordaron el problema.

ENG version

I am going to be the most explicit, I bought a set of 3 cameras and I use the cloud service, everything was very good, I liked the cameras for their simplicity, and they seem to me an excellent option within the price, but all the problem came with the first failure (eye, the blink app has some bugs and others but nothing that says waooooo is insufferable because I understand the massive use of their servers) the first failure was the camera keeps blinking without any prior command from me or anything but it doesn't respond as if it were running something, first I thought it would be some firmware update, but it took more than half an hour which is not logical because 30 minutes of surveillance doesn't make sense to lose them, so I wrote to service and technician and tarannnn, They answered me as if everything were a brochure for beginners, but that wouldn't bother me if they gave some solution and well, it didn't help, they didn't solve anything and words more words less, according to him that wasn't going to happen again, what Al bothers me because if he didn't do anything to the software or hardware like I was thinking of fixing something but well, I incredulously ask him what guarantee he can give me on that and basically he gives me his word, which is just as useless as water in the ocean but, well, I repeat the same thing to him and he gives me his word again 2 days later the same error happens and the only thing they know how to say is that they don't know.
Well, maybe on youtube there is the solution or the community generates it, but for me it is absurd that a company that seeks to engage you with a subscription system has such a poor service, luckily they send you the camera and everything is integrated but it is not like that They charge you for a subscription system and then they don't offer you anything else on the subject of support, repulsive business method, it's a pity that I already lost money, but I hope you don't waste time and money on this product or any of the Blink family and It's not that the camera is bad, for the price it's fine, but the technical support is disgusting, because I find the way they approached the problem almost insulting.",negative

The extra memory to me amounts to useless space, but I personally do not use audiobooks or books with larger file sizes.

I have a fairly large library, and that still was working out alright on my 7th gen with 4GB or less. For certain users, this will be the proper device to get. For others, they should look at the 8GB model, or perhaps using your phone for audio. I highly recommend the ""essentials"" bundles to save money.

A normal user could have 2000-3000 normal books on their device with the 8GB. Seeing as a ton of my books are Delphi collections, this amounts to even more books relative to the average sizing around 2-4MB or so. Fact is, most people simply don't need this space, and it is useless for most by the time they upgrade due to batteries becoming less efficient. Audiobooks tend to take a lot more space, and it might be for this user that the 32GB is most appropriate.

You can hold 20-40 audiobooks on an 8GB device, so for people that must have audiobooks on a Kindle, as opposed to their smartphone with better speakers and more memory, then maybe this is for you. But I would prefer audio on a device of my choosing that had better options for sound.

The wireless charging is basically not a deal changer for me. I highly recommend having wireless off on the Kindle to save battery. Charging it works much the same as any device, but cords work fine for me as well, especially with the updated USB-C design. The auto-light is awkward mostly, and I have never used it on any device with one. For the extra money, I only find this device useful for people that absolutely need audio for their Paperwhite device.

In full I simply will not use the extra space, and the other features are useless. Others may find them more appropriate. I don't see the point in paying Amazon more money. The lifeline of this device depends on the battery, and by the time I need 32GB, if that ever happens, I will be getting a new device. Not bad, but too expensive, as I mostly use physical books anyway.

Overall Review for the Paperwhite 2021 (Four Stars):

Summary:

+ Best screen of any Paperwhite or Kindle released to date
+ Best response time of any Paperwhite or Kindle
+ UI improvements
+ Weight and feel are exceptional

- Screen has uneven area with color temp on high brightness
- Expensive
- Previous Kindles still do things in much the same way

Coming from the 7th gen Kindle, this is a gigantic improvement on all fronts. The Paperwhite 2021 also handily beats the pulp out of the Paperwhite 2018 version due to its new LED array, and for my money it's a better choice than the Oasis 3 as well due to ergonomics. Add in some extra screen real estate compared to previous Paperwhites, a much nicer bezel, a few more options for the UI, and what we have is an extremely polished device for reading digital books. It's never going to make me switch totally from physical, but I will definitely be using this to read a lot more than my previous Kindle.

The screen here is nearly perfect, and it will be the main factor attracting those coming from the previous 2018 model. If things were cheaper, this would be an essential upgrade for most people. I would not do without it if given the choice. Feel free to browse all the negative reviews from 2018. They were all right. But now it seems Amazon has finally finished their beta device. The screen itself is more matte than shiny, easy to wipe off, clear but not distracting, and fully able to replicate a physical book with its expanded dimensions. The Oasis 3 for instance irritates me with its form factor. The Paperwhite 2018 has an ugly bezel as well. This is exactly what I wanted out of an E-Reader.

The Paperwhite 2021 is lit by 17 LEDs compared to 5 LEDs in the 2018 model, which leads to vastly superior balance. There are 24 gradations for both brightness and warmth, from off to mango warm, and they make a tangible and visible difference in proper aesthetics related to actual physical books. The color options are great, but after some use there still seems to be a portion equating to about the bottom half of the screen on mine that is a very slightly greener hue as opposed to a warmer hue on top. Very hard to pick up for some people, but it's worth noting for users that want to use this on high brightness. I usually only use around 6-12 brightness to get proper coloring, and it's not really noticeable in lit rooms with these settings. I usually use the lovely dark mode at night, so in the end I'll say this issue really doesn't affect me much.

Make no mistake, though, the 2018 Paperwhite had an awful screen, with a horrendous LED array, and this one is a massive upgrade. This 2021 version still has a fully stable lighting array that doesn't evoke a poor production run or haste in design, yet it's not perfect either. Blacks could definitely be deeper with an OLED screen or something of the sort. Dark Mode still looks good, but on higher brightness it appears a little too grey. Overall, I am satisfied at the advances that have been made, and my usual settings all look fantastic and so much better than anything before.

6.8 inches of screen along with 300 PPI is definitely enough to satisfy most demands for resolution, and the extra space may be convincing for one to switch from physical books. The bezel itself also looks properly designed finally. That alone is also another huge deal. The sides are thin, the screen is the main attraction, and there is no awkwardness in reading versus a real book. All additions that make this is a positive buy over the other Kindles.

There is an extremely tiny trail of adhesive in one corner and edge at the very bottom right near the backing material and black area of the bezel. Pretty minor all told. Most won't even notice things like this, and most Kindles will probably have such a minor flaw. Compared to the 2018 version, this thing seems like an actual professional product.

The UI responsiveness was another issue in previous models, and I am happy to report this one is very fast. Massively faster than my 7th gen, and a decent improvement over the older model. The Paperwhite 2018 uses a Freescale/NXP i.MX6 SoloLite 1 GHz processor. Not terrible, but also not quite enough to match the newer NXP i.MX7D 1 GHz chip used in the Oasis 3 and this model. Again, a more refined version at every level compared to the older Paperwhite.

For memory and storage, I can't see many people needing more than 8GB. I did fine on my last Kindle with much less. Unless you plan on starting a small library, 8GB of memory is a perfect fit for anyone's lifetime.

As for the user interface, major changes have resulted in a much better flow in overall design for most Kindles from 2015 onward. The swipe down mechanic is leagues better than anything they've had before. The library UI that you tap in the upper left is again fast and finally consistent. These UI details are easy to spot in the included pictures with various lighting values. But they are available to most users outside of this product.

Response and animation are a cut above their predecessors, and that should not be understated. I finally feel the Kindle is quick enough for my needs with digital reading. My 7th gen was abysmal. The 2018 version was slightly problematic. The newer page turn animation, however, was not to my liking, and I ended up sticking with the normal style. As a plus, the web browser is snappy and usable for those that need to quickly look something up on a search engine. Exiting in and out of menus is a breeze, and opening or downloading books was efficient. I still wish there was a download all option, so I will be downloading from the website instead.

And speaking of default, the designers have made sure that this Kindle is ready to use without even touching a setting. They clearly invested a lot in understanding how people want their Kindle to look. I found almost all default options to be optimal. I added one step to boldness in fonts, and have toyed with the variable warmth quite a bit. Bookerly is a great font for reading, but there are obviously other options if you prefer. These things are basically as good as they need to be on this digital reader. More improvements with font selection could be possible, but are entirely superfluous to the current experience.

Updating the firmware was painless for me past having to click no thanks for all the subscriptions Amazon wants to get you hooked on. No thanks. No issues with connections or anything of the sort. Charging works perfectly via USB-C, a far better connector than the micro version. Adding and subtracting to the library was fast and convenient.

Aesthetics and materials are premium for the most part. Other than the aforementioned pinprick trail of adhesive, there were no outright imperfections that I can see. I don't really like the Oasis 3, but it's definitely similar to that version, with a better form factor.

The leather case included with this bundle is what it is: completely overpriced but nearly mandatory for the perfect feel and weight. I can't stand the feel of the device without the included case. I highly recommend the bundle. The aesthetics look nice, and overall it's mostly the same as my last one. A bit easier to get in and out compared to 7th gen.

At the heart of it all, this is still just another updated version of the Paperwhite. But it could be mandatory because it polishes the lighting and page turning to a degree that makes the old devices feel awkward. I don't see myself getting another one for a decade. And that leaves two questions remaining: How is the battery life, and is this worth the upgrade if you own the 2018 version...

Battery life seems improved. I wouldn't call it all that great on full brightness, but it's definitely an upgrade from anything before. Battery life is critical, I have run into few issues with my normal settings. Right now, I can see that it drains decently fast on max brightness, but it also has an array of 17 LEDs lighting it. On lower brightness, it appears to be very conservative with battery life, much the same as last time but probably better. It's tough to say when you are comparing older batteries to newer ones. This will be an ongoing process to be updated in the review every now and then. On the lowest brightness it is off of course, for those that prefer the older Kindle experience and extended usage without a charge. This produces a charge that lasts a very long time.

For me I see no reason to keep Wi-Fi on, and the complaints about that particular setting, coming from 2018, seem slightly obtuse. Shut it off when your library is downloaded. Problem solved. With full brightness, you aren't going to get a ton of life, but I also recommend against full brightness as it doesn't really resemble paper at that point. On medium settings, which I prefer, battery life seems completely acceptable and better than before.

If you are currently using a device below the Paperwhite 2018, then definitely you could think about an upgrade if you are in the market for a new E-Reader. I cannot overstate how much better this is than my 7th gen. I rarely even used that model, and I will definitely be clocking in some time with this one due to the screen and response time. It's a huge motivating factor to actually take out my Kindle now. Previous versions do not match up, and this is the first time I can say I am impressed by a Kindle.

Coming from 2018, I would say this is a fairly huge upgrade, and most will want to eventually make the change. The screen is too versatile to pass up, and the faster response time basically nails the previous version in its coffin. I don't think an immediate upgrade is necessary, but most will want this as their baseline going forward. The 2018 version has too many issues, and this fixes most of them.

Economically, this might not be an option for many. To somewhat help out, you definitely will want to get this in the bundle with the leather case, which I included a picture of at the bottom. It's a nice case, way too expensive by itself, and kind of mandatory in my experience. The bundle also includes a trade-in option. Definitely DO NOT buy the case separately. No need to give Amazon any more of your money than necessary.

Outside of that you can be sure I will remain critical of this device. If anything goes wrong, becomes damaged or defective, I will immediately add that info to my review. No shilling is allowed here. Freezes have gone completely away as of the recent firmware update in 1.14.1.1.

For those on the fence, it is best to wait a few months to see how things turn out. For now, I enjoy the device and have only a few issues. Going forward I hope to actually use a Kindle consistently for the first time. If I rated the Paperwhite 2018 one star, then this one is around four stars. A worthy upgrade for anybody in the market. Will it replace my physical collection? Never. Paper lives on forever.

291,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads",$189.99,5,"I own the 11th Gen (newest model 2022) standard Kindle Paperwhite and the Signature Paperwhite. I love them both. If dough is not the issue, I would buy the Signature model for fifty bucks more. Here’s some of my particular findings in use.

Cases: Note that I do not like the Amazon cases because I don’t like folding over cover type cases; I prefer cases that simply help with holding the device. I purchased the “MoKo Case for 6.8"" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear” from Amazon and it fits the Kindle ideally, and most importantly this case DOES go on the proprietary charging stand made by Anker and the charge does go through the case (that is, I do not need to remove the case to charge the Kindle in that charging stand).

Battery: Amazon states that the Kindle 11th gen will hold a charge for 10 weeks, when used at limited brightness for 90 minutes a day (and a lot of other stipulations, like WiFi and Bluetooth off, etc). In reality, many may turn up the brightness, read more than 90 minutes, and Airplane mode on, or use other features that drain the battery faster (See audiobooks below). I have found that my battery drains faster than 10 weeks, but I am using the device with Airplane mode off, Wifi on, Bluetooth On. I do not like turning off wifi in particular because it MUST Be on to sync books between devices, and since I have two Kindle 11th gens, plus a MacBook, iPhone, iPad, and I read 5 books at a time simultaneously, I have no desire to turn wi-fi off. Thus, having Qi charging is helpful…not mandatory but helpful. Another BIG reason for the Qi charging is Audible audiobooks. I do listen to them through the Kindle itself, and the battery drains fairly quickly when listening to audiobooks.

Memory Storage: The Kindle has 8 GB storage, but only 5.8 GB after their software OS. The Signature Kindle has 32 GB storage, but only 28 GB after their software OS (there is slightly different software between the two models as the Signature supports more menu and charging features). So if you love downloaded “off-line” reading, and in particular if you enjoy having audiobooks in your downloaded library (they take much more storage than an e-book), the 32 GB is reassuring.

Auto-light adjust: I can’t even detect that it’s doing anything, but if one rides a train daily to work and it passes through dark tunnels, this feature may be of benefit to you.

Advertising free: Many forget the $20 value of the ad-free that is part of the Kindle Signature. Even those that wouldn’t pony up for it on their own may enjoy it here as “icing on the cake” for the price difference. I like seeing my own book cover on the sleep screen, and that is not possible with the “with ads” version. I thought I enjoyed the ads for editors choice books and book sales and stuff, but I much prefer the ad-free model. And, little discussed fact, the ad-free version has one less swipe to get to your Library or current book every single time you turn on the Kindle. True!

Dedicated Signature Charger Stand: I bought the Qi charging stand and like it greatly. It does work with my “MoKo Case for 6.8"" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear”., and charges through the case and the case fits the stand (but not quite as bump-proof as the Kindle without the case). I like that the stand sits quietly on my desk as I am working, or on my coffee table while I’m watching sports do I can read during commercials. I do not need to keep the AC cord attached to the stand at all times; sometimes I use the charger stand as simply a free-standing stand for either of my Kindles. I like that it can hold my Kindle 11th generation normal edition without Qi charging and I can read on it as an easel stand. I feel the utility as an easel stand is underrated. Qi chargers in general are not free, and neither are easel stands, so coupling those two together, you get the price of this Anker model. I find no issues with the size of the “wall wart” or the plug in the back of the stand. Some people complain with the charging stand that the white light indicator does not turn to another color, such as green, to indicate full charge. A “work around” for this is to place the charging Kindle on the stand upside down; now the LED light at the bottom of the Kindle device itself, which does change color when fully charged, is face upward and easily seen. Frankly, there is no issue with simply assuming the Signature PW is charged after an hour or two. I like this stand much more than I thought I would.

I’ve owned every Kindle since the first one! I use library Libby, and am an Audible and Kindle Unlimited subscribers. I guess you could say I’m a “power user”. I definitely prefer the Signature version, but both are good readers. If I could change one thing about these Kindles, it would be to add a physical button like the Oasis. I realize that sounds outdated, but to reach and switch with the other hand, or reach thumb across screen to scrub, every page turn is a chore that is solved with an under-thumb button like Oasis. Additionally, the e-ink is good, but after two decades, one would think the text versus background contrast would be better…that is, darker text, whiter background. Instead, it remains darkest gray text in lightest gray background, not ideal. Happy reading!",positive
292,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads",$189.99,3,"My first Kindle was the 2nd edition with keyboard and joystick. I've owned many since, my favorite being the Voyage. When that one got a scratch on the screen, I decided it was time to upgrade and got the Signature Edition of the Paperwhite. While there are many good things about this model, the UI and certain policies by Amazon have drastically harmed the usability of this reader.

First off, visibility of the screen is quite nice when reading. The ability to adjust the warmth of the light is very welcome. The slightly larger screen than the Voyage means more text can fit on the screen, though it does weigh a little more and is larger. You feel the difference in your hand when holding it for longer periods (which is usually the result of average reading sessions). Still, that's all expected when using something slightly larger. While reading, it's a very nice experience.

That nice experience disappears outside of reading though. If you are more than a casual reader and have been building a library of ebooks, you'll find the experience very lacking, especially as you get older. There is a fact about growing older... your eyesight changes. Even if you don't need glasses for clarity, your ability to see contrast diminishes as you get older. Greyscale images are more difficult to read. The new UI lists books in a ""cover view"" where you see a grid of thumbnail images of the cover of the books in your library. Trying to read the titles of the books from a smaller greyscale image of the cover is difficult. A simple listing would be better. The UI does offer a simple listing, but when you choose to view your listing in this manner, you then see one long listing of all of the books on your kindle and do NOT see them grouped by Collections. The larger your library, the more books you have to scroll through. Collections in this view become worthless, forcing you to see your entire library. You have three different choices then, all of which are cumbersome. You can: 1) Scroll through a long listing of ALL of your books; 2) Scroll through just a Collection and see your books by images of their covers (harder to read with 55+ eyes); or 3) Keep switching views as you move in and out of collections. It's frustrating, and Amazon gives no way to offer feedback, forcing you to accept what they choose without comment.

A recent decision by Amazon groups graphic novels and comics as part of your Kindle library. If you use their Comixology service to buy and read digital comics and graphic novels, then all of those are also listed in your Kindle library, even though reading material like that on an e-ink Kindle is probably the last thing you'll want to do. Most fans of graphic novels either read them on color devices where the artwork can be appreciated. You have to rely on filters to get rid of those listings.

While many people may not consider the UI changes to be too impacting, the more books you have and the older you are increase the difficulty level. Having been buying books since the 2nd Edition Kindle, I have a library of over 1,500 books. That's a lot to sort through when I want to reread one, and my 62-year-old eyes don't handle the greyscale images well. It's a very unpleasant experience until I actually find the book and open it.

On more thing... I suspect the wireless charger is somewhat temperamental. I have wireless charging pads in my home, and my phone (which is in a case) happily charges on them. The Kindle won't charge on any of them while it's in a case. Removing it from the case for charging is extremely cumbersome, so wireless charging is non-functional for me. The thickness of the case isn't any more than what's on my phone, so I suspect the kindle is fussier about being in closer contact with the pad, which is a shame.

---Update 24/08/2022---
I added an additional star to the review because I just received a phone call from the Kindle team regarding the issues I brought up in my review. We discussed them and the development team is being given a recording of all that I said so they can improve the UI experience (fingers crossed!). It's a good thing the team checks what's said in reviews and followis up with users who are unhappy, so I bumped up my review from two stars to three. I'll also modify the review and score to reflect future updates to the UI since it's only fair to rate the device on what the customer is going to receive when they buy one.",fair
293,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads",$189.99,5,"For many years I have been a staunch believer that physical books were the only proper way to enjoy my favorite books. For years my wife gently suggested a kindle, to stop the incoming tide of books piling up on shelves and even under the bed. Well I finally decided to give one a shot, and I could not be happier. The paperwhite does an excellent job of mimicking the look of a real page and I have not experienced any eye fatigue at all while reading. The Signature edition is worth the extra cost in my opinion for the additional storage space, but also the auto adjusting back light. I did not think that feature would make much of a difference to me but has quickly become one of my favorite features as it allows me to keep reading without stopping to adjust brightness when going from inside to outside or if the lighting changes in the room I am sitting in. At night the subtle glow of the Kindle Paperwhite helps me with not falling asleep while reading, usually a constant struggle for me, but doesn't leave me restless like looking at my phone does. The battery life is phenomenal. I have been using mine for 2 weeks and still have 60% battery life remaining on my original charge. I have changed my physical book buying habits to exclusively my favorites that I want to display and collect, but my everyday reading is now done almost exclusively on the Paperwhite. The ease of access to it and all the books in my Kindle library has increased the amount I am reading and that is the best reason I can think of to make the switch if you are unsure.

A few minor gripes that I have found would be, the touchscreen, the kindle store specifically on the kindle, and graphic novels/comics. The touchscreen isn't unresponsive, but occasionally it doesn't pick up my swipes the first input. Not regular enough to even be an annoyance honestly, but worth mentioning. I do not recommend navigating the kindle store on the Kindle Paperwhite. The kindle is not designed with browsing the store in mind, and as such is slow and downright clunky. Fortunately there is a simple solution, browse the kindle store on your phone then just hit send to kindle. It's super easy to do and your Kindle will start downloading automatically once it has access to Wifi. I typically browse on my phone for a new book while taking a break at work, and when I pick up my Kindle when I'm ready to read the book is already downloaded and waiting. Lastly, I would not recommend using the Paperwhite to read graphic novels/comics personally. Everything is obviously in black and white so you aren't getting the full impact of the illustrations. This one is more up to personal preference but I would prefer to read these in full color.

To summarize my rambling; If you are considering making the switch to an e-reader, the Kindle Paperwhite should absolutely be your first choice. Excellent battery life, convenience, and ease of access that has revolutionized my daily reading habits.",positive

Finally bought myself a Paperwhite and LOVE it! For years I resisted e-books I was the last person that would ever convert from paper to an electronic device. However during Covid 2020 and beyond I made the switch to the dark side, and had fallen in love with reading on my iPad. For various reasons I find it easier to read some sort of device. Recently I began to look at a Paperwhite, bought this version and suddenly feel like I have wasted so much time ! Reading on this is smooth, the touch screen is very responsive ,I find myself able to read much faster , for longer periods of time and more often. This little device goes everywhere with me now is extremely lightweight much smaller than I was used to with my iPad , surprisingly this has not been a problem , actually prefer this size since it will fit in any bag or purse I carry . Battery life is amazing !! I have not had to charge it yet and I have owned it approximately three weeks! I read daily even if only for a few minutes but find that because of the adjustments I can make to the font size and the back lighting I have literally no eye strain. This has increased the length of time I can read , especially at night or in low lighting. I have not been able to test it outside , in the sun yet. That will be the final test for me. I love that I can carry my entire digital library with me pretty much anywhere I go. Five stars , I would give it 10 if it if I could so convenient and fun! Don’t waste your time looking at all these reviews researching and wasting all that time when you could be reading. Just do yourself a kindness and buy yourself a fun little Paperwhite ! it is well worth the money. I have nothing negative to say about it ! Extremely happy with my new toy! And get yourself a cute cover, makes it much easier to hold onto. This leaves you with only one more question…

295,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads",$189.99,4,"This is my 2nd e-Ink Kindle. My first is a 3G/WiFi/Keyboard type from 2010. While it's still in excellent shape and even has the original battery, cellular companies bailed from their 3G support a while ago, and sadly, just recently Amazon stopped supporting the Shop feature of this old unit, even on WiFi. I'm holding onto it as a backup, as I can always upload docs via my computer, but since I do so much reading I decided to break down and buy the Paperwhite Signature edition bundle, which included a leather cover and wireless charging dock.

I'm so used to my older keyboard-style Kindle that I was a little apprehensive switching to a touchcreen, but I was pleasantly surprised at the relative ease of navigation. Overall there is a lot to like about the new Signature edition, and I would have rated it at 5 stars, save for a few small annoyances:

1. There must be a way to turn off the wake-on-open feature, triggered by the magnet within the front cover. I realize some covers do not have a magnet and therefore won't trigger the wake function upon opening, but one should be able to enable/disable this feature in the Settings menu. I like the magnet, as it helps keep the cover closed, but I don't always want the Kindle to wake up when opened.

2. I am so used to the paging buttons on my old Kindle, I REALLY miss them! One needs to be careful swiping left or right via the touchscreen, as sometimes a page may be skipped over. As I get used to the touchscreen this seems to be occurring less often. Not sure if a ""Swipe Sensitivity"" setting would help here or not, but may be a feature worth adding in the Settings menu.

3. The power button on the bottom edge should be a slider-type, definitely NOT a push button! My old Kindle has a spring-loaded slider along the bottom edge, with a fairly long throw, so I have never accidentally triggered it (at least that I can recall, that is).

4. I would like to see a bit more control by the user on exactly what is displayed on the Home screen. While I purchased the add-free version, I am a minimalist and do not want to see recommended books or a lot of clutter unless I turn this feature on. Perhaps there is a way to customize the Home screen and turn this feature off but I simply haven't figured it out yet, so this review may be updated at a later time.",positive
296,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads",$189.99,5,"I have had a Kindle for 12 years, usually trade up when I have enough rewards and the Kindle that I want is on sale, so I get the trade up free or next to nothing. I started with regular kindle and moved up to Kindle Paperwhite when they brought it out. This Paperwhite Signature is the best I have had!

1. NO ADS! I love not having ads, all my previous Kindles have had the ads. I should have gone ad free years ago!

2. The 6.8"" screen and the pixels per inch make a huge difference to my old eyes at a smaller font size than my previous 2018 paperwhite. The screen seems much clearer, which is probably the combo of the larger screen, better lighting, and higher ppi. I didn't think it would make a big difference, but its huge for me!

3. This should probably be with #2 but it deserves its own point. I have always had trouble looking through the store or library on previous Kindles due to the pictures/title of the covers being so hard to read in B&W. I would use my PC or tablet to find the books I wanted and send them to the Kindle. Not so with the Paperwhite signature! I can easily navigate the store or library, even without my glasses! I still hate that I can't choose the payment method and it defaults to my Amazon gift card when buying kindle books.

4. The touch screen is more responsive than my previous 2018 kindle paperwhite. Much more!

5. The dark mode is much better with the Kindles Paperwhite Signature, much better.

6. Battery life: I've only had it for 2 weeks at the time of writing this review, but I have only charged it once and it's still at 83% and that's after reading about 1-3 hours per day. I am happy with that.

7. Wireless charging is very nice! I use the wireless charger for my phone, it seemed faster than the one for my Amazon Fire HD8 Plus, but it works also.

8. I bought this case, it's awesome. What I like about it, is that you can wireless charge with it on, and rest the Kindle on a pillow and lay down and read.

297,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads",$189.99,5,"My Kindle Paperwhite 7th gen (released 2015), was still working fine when I upgraded to this. I have been waiting for the USB - C Kindle, and I'm now officially micro-usb free. I traded in and paid the extra to get the wireless charging so that, when this Kindle lasts many years to come, I can still use it when we're someday cable-free entirely.

At a high level, this Kindle is a terrific device. Until color Kindles come out some day years from now, it's going to be perfect for reading use. It's lightweight and a pleasure for me to use with one or two hands. All my minor complaints aside, I truly love this device and use it daily. I have no complaints with regard to my daily use. If you have the Kindle paperwhite I had before, it's not worth upgrading unless you want to treat yourself. I have no regrets about the purchase, as I wanted to treat myself. If you don't have a Kindle, this is the best, and you will enjoy it.

The reasons I upgraded:
-Larger screen. Nice, not necessary but apprecated
-Dark mode. Old generations didn't have this (thanks, Amazon, for artificially limiting older generations' software)
-USB-C. I was way too excited about this, but I stand by it.

I was concerned that the flush glass screen would be worse than my old paperwhite's recessed screen. It is, but not noticeably so, which I'm pleasantly surprised to say. It's less paper-y than the old Kindles, but makes the Kindle look very clean and crisp. It's plenty responsive, and there's still enough bezel to hold it without touching the screen.

It also has the same ppi (Pixels per inch) of my 2015 Kindle, and the new screen type makes it less clear because of the layers. I was concerned about that too, but it's not noticeable.

Side-loading books is still very easy with new versions of Calibre.

Dark mode is great for reading in bed with the lights off without bothering a partner next to you in bed. I upgraded primarily for the dark mode, as regular mode is too bright for me when I'm trying to go to sleep (same for real books with a reading light).

It wirelessly charges on both of my phone chargers, one of which is one of the stand-style chargers (like the Amazon-branded Kindle one). I'm a little surprised that the larger Kindle still works on my phone's charging stand, and it is an excellent little surprise.

A couple other notes for you future owners:
-Don't buy the Amazon-branded cases for this generation. They're a rip-off and poorly designed this generation. There are many generic cases that work just as well, such as Ayotu's. I use that case for when I travel with the Kindle in a bag.
-Don't buy the Amazon-branded USB wall adapters. They're ridiculously overpriced, and their maximum wattage is below the Kindle's maximum charging wattage. Amazon scam.
-Don't buy the Amazon Kindle charging stand. It's got a weird proprietary cable to hook into the wall. You're better off getting one flat wireless charging pad, as pretty soon (if you're not already there), your phone, earbuds, and Kindle will all charge wirelessly, and a flat pad will be able to fit all of them. How often will you really need to charge your Kindle, anyways?
-I got a Harris Tweed sleeve from SarahJayneDesi9ns on Etsy, and highly recommend it. It's beautiful.

Other miscellaneous gripes:
-It's a ripoff that Amazon charges for you to remove ads from a product you bought, but that's not relevant to this version, as there is no ad version with wireless charging.
-It's a ripoff that I couldn't have dark mode on my old paperwhite. It's black and white. It's not too difficult to push a software update to it to make it white and black. They just wanted me to upgrade (and it worked). Buying this product supports that corporate mentality.
-The screen is the same ppi and slightly blurrier than my 2015 Kindle.
-To reiterate, the main upgrades are a charging port that Android phones have used since 2008 and a software update that they wouldn't let my 2015 Kindle have.

I still love this Kindle and will use it daily for years to come. For being a mainstream product, I really appreciate Kindles' longevity, and I truly hope this one will last for years like the previous generations have.",positive
298,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads",$189.99,5,"My Kindle Voyage did not survive being laundered. Yes, it was caught up in the bedsheets. Too bad; that was IMO the best of all the Kindles in its time. But never mind, the Voyage is history.

The new Paperwhite finally makes up for the shortcomings of its predecessors, by incorporating most of the best features of the best versions of each. It lacks only physical page-turn buttons, which is something I, at least can easily live without.

From the Oasis it has the larger screen, the color-temperature adjustment, the auto-brightness. It did not, thankfully, retain the terrible battery life, the reason I traded my Oasis in.

From the Voyage it has the absolutely perfectly even screen lighting.

The regular version has the reasonable price of previous Paperwhites, and USB-C; the Signature adds the lack of ads and the extra storage for audiobooks.

All it lacks is the feather lightness of the Voyage; the new Kindle is a handful. But add a hand-strap, or a case with a strap, and you'll never care about the weight.

The battery life is prodigious. Have I mentioned that already? I've owned Keyboards, Basics, Paperwhites, Oases, Voyages, and this new Paperwhite beats them all. It seems like the battery level barely creeps downward.

The software is pretty much the same across all my recent Kindles, and it's fine. Different people quibble about different features, and that's OK, but with some study you can usually figure out how to make it do what you want. It's more than fine, and compared to earlier Kindles it's sort of a miracle.

The lack of cellular connectivity is a non-issue, IMO. Yes, if you don't have a phone that can provide a wifi hotspot, or you live in a wifi desert, or you don't have a computer, then maybe it's a problem. Or maybe your lack of connectivity in general is more of a problem. But cellular has always been the least-used method of getting books onto Kindles, so I can't criticize Amazon for no longer providing it for free.

Meanwhile, my new Paperwhite Signature is scratching all my itches. My wife, who complains about everything, loves hers too.",positive
299,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads",$189.99,5,"I've owned three different Kindles and here's my comparison and what I liked about them:

I got the Kindle Paperwhite back in 2018 because I was sick of notifications popping up on my phone and iPad interrupting me while trying to read. I loved that I could focus on reading, read in the dark without bothering my boyfriend and that the battery life was so amazing!

I upgraded to the Kindle Oasis in 2020 and loved the elevated experience, but I noticed the battery didn't last nearly as long as my Kindle Paperwhite. Which is incredibly disappointing when the Kindle Oasis is so expensive. To be honest the whole reason I bought the Special Edition version is because I read the battery life was so good and has ample amount of storage in it, probably more than I could ever need in this lifetime.

The other thing I noticed about the Special Edition version, that I did not hear a single review mention on YouTube or TikTok, is how super responsive the screen is! I swear, to me it seems to respond faster than either of the previous models I have owned before. A super nice surprise. I personally love having the long battery life because I mostly read laying down and the last thing I want is to have to charge it while I'm reading, just too restrictive for me. I would get the Special Edition version if you really love downloading and keeping a ton of books to read for leisure and/or read a lot of books or PDFs for school. I think 32 gb would go along way if I were using this as a student exclusively in place of physical books.

Overall, if I had to pick from the three versions of Kindle I have owned, I would go with the Oasis version. If like me, you really hate having to move your hand to tap the screen to go to the next or previous page. Want a more premiere reading experience don't really care that you have to charge more often, this is checks all the boxes.",positive
300,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Echo Dot (4th Gen) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Glacier White,$34.99,5,"Well, yes, absolutely. OK, first about this 4th generation Echo Dot; no more hockey puck, it's now more like a tiny satellite earth station. A much improved speaker seems to give correspondingly better sound with improved clarity; other than that, same old same old (a good thing). If you are looking for dynamite sound, well, this ain't it - what do you expect from a single two-inch speaker? It's not really bad, though. A new chip set seems to give much faster responses to commands. Want quite good sound from an Echo Dot? Just plug any reasonably good sound bar into the 3.5mm audio out jack - the results are surprisingly good.
But the real reason for this review is to convince you to put an Echo device - Dot, original Echo or whatever in every room. We upgraded several of our Gen 1 Dots to Gen 4 (like this one), so we had extra old school Dots lying around. Do we really need one in the garage, or the laundry, or the second bath? Well, we have them so might as well use them.
Putting an Echo device in every room may well have saved my life or at least minimized serious injury - Really! I was installing a work light in the garage when I managed to fall off a ladder, landing flat on my back on the concrete floor and hitting my head on a car bumper (just don't ask!). Not knocked out, but couldn't move. I knew my wife was in the sun room, so I called out ""Echo - drop in on sunroom"" and when the 'Connected' beep sounded said ""Garage - please help!"" With out the Echo drop in I might well have been lying there for hours. Ambulance, nerve damage and a happy drug-induced state for a week so far, but how much worse it might have been.
So go ahead, install an Echo (get some refurbed Gen 1 or 2's if you want to save a few bucks). Enable 'drop in' in the device settings and give yourself some peace of mind. BTW, you can now use the command ""Drop in on all devices"" but since this requires processing through the Amazon Cloud there may be a bit of delay, as opposed to the direct device-to-device link with a single drop in. In any case, do it. Someday, it might prove really important!",positive
301,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Echo Dot (4th Gen) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Glacier White,$34.99,5,"One of the main features I’d like about alcohol over Google is that they allow you to change the name you used to call them up. I don’t like seeing Alexa or hey Google, I’d like to be able to use my own word and in my case are used the word computer. Yes that sounds like I’m a geek but I like seeing computer and then stayed in my commands much better than Alexa or hey Google. That just makes me feel like one of the sheep in the herd.

It does seem to interface very well with all the devices I have but of course you will eventually find something that is difficult to pair it up with especially when you try to get different manufacturers to work together. Sometimes it can be as difficult as getting Windows 95 to work online. That was a joke back then. Down side to heaven a customize name is when you use a name that is brought up in normal conversation it can activate for no reason. For instance, I have one in my living room not too far from the TV so when someone mentions the name computer once in a while it will activate but no big deal as it only happens some of the time. just remember the Echo Dot is the smaller one.

I have had only one issue which is real easy to correct but I still have not figured out why it occasionally happens. Sometimes I look at it and I see a red lighted ring on the bottom lit up. That indicate someone turned off the listening capability so it is not listening or story what you say. For some people that is done deliberately when you don’t want it listening. In my case there are only two people in my house and no one is turning it off. There is a button on the top when you push it muted and turned the light red so correctly this means just pushing the button on the top to turn it back on. The only annoying thing is that I do not know why it turned off several times on me so far and I have not been able to related to any activity in the house so maybe there is a voice command and it is picking up the command from listening to the TV. It’s sort of like if you remember the old device sold a long time ago called the clipper, which would turn your lights on or off when you clip your hands. I often wonder what would happen if their device was near your TV and on the TV the audience was clapping , will the lights flash on and off in your house. LOL.",positive

303,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Echo Dot (4th Gen) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Glacier White,$34.99,4,"This is my first ever Echo device, so my review is more of the whole system than of just this particular device - as I have nothing to compare it to.

The good is most everything. Sound quality is fine for me, as I keep it pretty quiet for the most part. It's in my living room, so I don't normally want it blaring in my face when I am playing music.

The voice recognition software seem to work very well. Alexa always recognizes her name, although to my credit I always speak to her clearly and plainly, at a volume slightly higher than my normal conversational one. A normal robot tone, in other words. So I can offer no input on how she does for the ""less robotic"" speaker.

Functionality-wise is where things can use improvement. Although there is still ""good"" there. I like hearing the weather every morning. Although I can't seem to get the news feed for my morning routine customized the way I like it. And the commands Alexa recognizes seems to be a mixed bag. She knows and does some things I would expect her to, but not all. And if she mis-understands, she normally does what she thinks you are asking for. Which can get annoying.

The only other devices I have integrated into the system are my Ring doorbells. So I have no input on how she controls lights, thermostat, etc. As for the Rings, that has been a disappointment. The thing I do most often with my Rings is to 'silence' motion alerts for periods of time when there are people outside in my yard doing activities. So my hope was that instead of going into the Ring app and silencing all three of the devices, one at a time, that Alexa could do all of them at once for me. That is not the case, unfortunately.

In summation, I am glad I got this... since I got it on some crazy deal for $10. At the normal price, I would not buy one. Doesn't do enough for me to make it worth the cost, beyond it being a novelty. Although I do use the bluetooth speaker functionality to play music a lot, so it has pretty-much replaced my living-room bluetooth speaker. It's just easier to say ""play music"" than it is to have to get up, walk over, and turn on my battery operated speaker. Although I do prefer to control the volume of that speaker though the app on my phone, which is easier than constantly saying ""Alexa, turn it up/down.""",positive
304,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Echo Dot (4th Gen) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Glacier White,$34.99,5,"So, I had the 1st generation dot for a LONG time. I replaced it with this dot. I have my theater stereo wired in my dot, so, the sound quality is awesome! There hasn’t been any issues with it since I connected it to my wi-fi.

However, I have had some trouble with playing my music. It is like it “stutters” every once and while. When it does that, it lags and when I terminate the music app, when the app disappears, dot keeps playing for about 3 seconds and stops.

My daughter enjoys messing multiple my mood by calling on Alexa and requesting some Cocomelon to play!! She is smart and does this on a daily basis. Soooo, I tolerate it for one or two songs and I put the kibosh on it!

This is a really reliable device. It will literally start your day with customized routines…plays the news from the sources you like. It will wake you up with some gentle music so you’re not scared awake! There’s nothing worse than jumping awake cause the phone alarm sucks!!

In conclusion, if you’re into having a personal assistant to learn your daily routine, plays music of your choice - the Dot for you! Enjoy your dot…Alexa is your friend and will do ANYTHING for you, your family and friends; you can play games (trivia) too.",positive
305,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Echo Dot (4th Gen) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Glacier White,$34.99,5,"I have Echos all over the house including a stereo pair with the Amazon subwoofer. 95 percent of the light bulbs in my house are Phillips Hue and controlled by Alexa. I also have 4 Amazon Smart Plugs controlled by Alexa. I have 10 Blink Cameras from Amazon which I can also see on my Echo Show. Alexa is so convenient for controlling of lights and switches plus you can control everything from your smart phone too wherever you are. It really spoils you Between the lights, whole house music, and cameras it would be hard to go back without Alexa. I have the microphone turned off on many of them so they don't compete with each other. There are two downsides however. If your internet is down, none of it works which is why I wish they could incorporate cellular service for them as an option. It would be worth the extra money to have a seamless service. If internet goes down, Alexa would convert to cellular and for the cameras too. How nice would that be? Are you listening Amazon? Another downside is if the lights go out, when they come back on every light in the house comes on and because the router is rebooting or internet is out, you have to turn off each light manually because of no internet or wait for the internet to come back up so you can control them.

306,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Echo Dot (4th Gen) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Glacier White,$34.99,5,"This is my first smart speaker, so my 5 star rating is based on the fact that it performs as expected, and serves the purposed I envisioned for it, and tempered by the fact that I don't have a lot of experience with these devices. Look to others to compare one speaker type to another. It was purchased during a Prime Day sale, with a smart plug adaptor.

Setup was easy, and there is lots of instructional information to assist someone trying to hook up one of these devices. The device is in my kitchen, with a open plan type downstairs. It picks up my voice from wherever I have needed it to, and I have not tried to test its limits. It also does well picking up my voice with background noise happening.

I have it attached to 2 Wiz smart bulbs, a smart plug insert (which controls a light), and the upstairs thermostat. Have not had any problems with that. I also use it to play podcasts, news, and music. Sound quality is as expected--that is middle of the road.

307,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Echo Dot (4th Gen) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Glacier White,$34.99,5,"It seemed apparent recently, that we needed another Amazon Alexa Echo Dot. in my apartment, I had just 2. One in living room and one in the bedroom. The price on Amazon was amazing and I installed right away with the app. But the new unit's hearing was so all-encompasing, the new Alexa was answering every voice request or command. within the 1 bedroom apartment. So I went into the Alexa app and changed the bathroom unit's name to ""Echo"". Echo doesnt seem to listen unless I repeat myself. But Im not mad. It takes awhile to get accustomed to a new roomate anyway. The blue glowing light is pretty cool and crisp looking under the Black base. Other names Amazon offers for the echo dot is ""Ziggy"" or ""Computer"". Im about to change it to ""computer"".
This echo dot works well and the setup was easy. My little (4-yo & 6 yo), kids love it. They love bossing Alexa around. They ask for weather, time, games like trivia, Alphabet songs and stories, Alexa cooperates well. The app is pretty amazing you can do so much. Reccomend? yes.",positive
308,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Echo Dot (4th Gen) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Glacier White,$34.99,5,"I have a 1st gen Echo, and a 2nd gen Echo Dot, so all impressions are in comparison to those. First thought when plugging it in, this thing is loud! I’m talking, stand across the room and hear every syllable clear as day loud. And that’s on the default volume level around half. I saw a couple other reviews that said the audio was weak or something… you need to swap it out for a new one because yours is defective. I can’t see myself ever reasonably turning these up all the way except just to test how loud it can get. Which I did… and it was really loud. Sound quality is good. It’s not full spectrum surround sound quality, but it doesn’t sound tinny or flat.

The light is now on the bottom, which aesthetically is really cool looking. One we put in the kitchen and happened to have a glass coaster looking stand that fits it perfectly, so the light lights up the glass stand which looks amazing. The other (bought 2) is just on a shelf, but even there it lights up the surface and looks pretty cool.

I bought these mostly because we needed a couple extra to connect to the new Blink doorbell we got so we would be alerted no matter where in the house we are. That, music while doing dishes or cleaning up, and the occasional “Alexa, what time is it?” when the electricity goes out and have to set all the clocks, is pretty much all we use them for. But for that, these work perfectly.",positive
309,Amazon Devices & Accessories,Echo Dot (4th Gen) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Glacier White,$34.99,4,"PROS:
+ Faster response than my older Dots
+ Better microphone than my older Dots
+ Sound quality as good or better than my older Dots
+ I love using these for streaming music and control my Kasa products
+ I like the available emergency features (more on this in my review)

CONS:
- The lights on the bottom are hard to see from a distance
- Amazon is starting to annoy me with new features I don't want
- Using these as intercoms has never worked for me. The sound quality (volume) has always been too low to be usable
- ""dropping in"" has never worked well either due to poor audio quality
- I have never been able to create a group of these for multi-room audio because they can't handle enterprise grade wifi (where more than one WAP has the same SSID and uses multiple bands)
- Privacy will always be a concern with these units. Who is listening?

Review:
I now have at least 15 dots. I have everything from the first generation to this latest 4th generation in use. I think for me, the 3rd gen devices are a better design. The lights on these 4th gen devices are on the bottom and are hard to see from across the room. On the 3rd gen the lights are on the top and much easier to see. Otherwise they are mostly the same at the moment. As time goes on the 3rd gen units will no doubt become slower by design just like my 1st and 2nd gen units are now.

My primary uses are control of my smart switches (Kasa) and to listen to music (DeadLive skill). I also like the integration with my Weather station (Ambient Weather) and the ability to make announcements across all the devices (like when dinner is ready). I also find the unit in the kitchen gets used to set timers for everything all the time.

Another use that is not immediately obvious is the use of these units for elder care. Let me explain how i have used them. I have an elderly mother who lives by herself. I purchased a Show and a Dot for her apartment and connected them to my account. The Show device is in her kitchen and the way I have it setup I can see the kitchen and her recliner from the built in camera. The Dot is in her bathroom. If she is not answering the phone or emails I can use the app on my phone to ""drop in"" on the Show unit and view the camera to see if she is in the kitchen or watching TV with her headphones on. Of course she knows about this setup and is OK with it. I can talk to her via the Show device or the Dot using the APP on my phone when I want to check to see if she is OK. Also, if she needs to contact me or 911 during an emergency she can do so with her devices. So if she were to slip in the bathroom or have a problem in the kitchen she can call 911 with the help of Alexa. It should also be noted that you must correctly set the physical address of the devices in the Alexa app if you want this to work as intended. I feel much better knowing that she has this system available to her. A friend of hers fell and broke a hip and was alone in her apartment for 3 days on the floor unable to get up before she finally remember she could call her daughter using the Alexa device she had. Doing so saved her life. That's what gave me the idea to set this up for my mom.

Aside from the above, there is the issue of the new features being introduced by Amazon that are becoming more annoying. One example of this is the unit waking me up to ask me if I want to write a product review for something I purchased. That is just a terrible idea. If I want to write a review, I will do so on my own. I don't need Alexa waking me up on a Saturday morning asking me about it. Work on that Amazon.",positive

UPDATED REVIEW : 28 August 2022
------------------------
Regret.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but definitely once you hit its limitations.

TLDR : Child can never have their own Amazon account without credit card information and proof of residence in THEIR name. So you can never buy apps on their own account for later use. Apps are non-transferable. #Regret

My kiddo has a Furby Connect toy, the app will not work in kids mode as it requires location services to be active. There is no override for this. Other apps we wanted to install were also complaining. We were also wanting to purchase apps which would have a longer lifespan and any in-app purchases on the actual child account will be lost as they age and obtain their own account anyway.

Other issues with the kids mode, the tablet grows considerably slower with time, adding in an SD card still triggers an error about the tablet being full even though there is room, you just have to say ok and try to ""ignore"" it.

So, easy fix right?
Set up an account for the child, load account with gift card, for the games which that were played the most on Kids+ - purchase those apps on the new account, lock everything down with an external app such as Kaspersky Kids.

Step 1. Create Gmail account purely for use on tablet

Step 2. Factory Reset tablet to set up with single ""adult"" account

Step 3. Create Amazon account for child

Step 4. Spend considerable time and effort setting up tablet with already purchased apps from Google Play and other free apps from the Amazon App store.

Step 5. Lastly, add Credit card for purchases on Amazon account.
Purchase first app on tablet.
Amazon Account locked.

Unusual activity detected on account.
Please wait 24H for someone to be in contact.
Wut ?

Tablet is completely inaccessible.

Right ok so ...

Step 4. Factory reset....

Step 5. Make another account for child.

Step 6. Spend the rest of the day setting up the account.

Step 7. Buy $25 gift card for new account with your own Amazon account

Step 8. Redeem $25 gift code on account for tablet

Step 9. Things seem to be working fine. Child asks for one more app she used to enjoy.
Try to add app.

Step 9. Account locked.

Unusual activity detected on account.
Please wait 24H for someone to be in contact.

.... wa wa wa.

Step 10. Contact Amazon Support.

- Be transferred to Kindle Support

- Beg and Please for Amazon to unlock tablet account for child.
-- Support person asks if I had already redeemed the voucher

// About to answer ""Yes""
// Browser update force closes browser, minor cursing.

- Resume chat (Thank a higher power for that)
-- Assigned new kindle support person.

- New support person claims to read chat.

The new support person wasn't even understanding my problem, I needed the account unlocked and they started to talk me through doing a factory reset.

At this point I lost my cool.

Expletives were expressed.

Tagged out and other half tags in.

Chat goes around in circles whilst Amazon requests that we send in Proof of Address and Credit Card information for the account holder and the explanation of ""Child is 4 and does not have a credit card, or actual proof of address for that matter, we are the parents, why can we not just enter our card information?""

We are told to submit the information and wait 24H.

Obviously my child does not own a credit card or receive any bills in their name and therefore this becomes an unsolvable paradox. I am now sitting with a locked account I can't unlock and a redeemed $25 gift card redeemed on that account as well. This is nothing short of BLATANT THEFT.

Step .......
OMG. Don't do it, just don't.

We went the very next day and purchased an Samsung A7 Lite instead.
Huawei would have been the better choice due to Samsung's bloatware, but thanks to their fragile stance with the Google Play store, they are best left alone for now.

PREVIOUS REVIEW : June 13, 2021
------------------------
Amazing -- Provided You Have No Interest In Previous In-App Purchases

It's amazing! So what's to dislike?

Well not much tbh, but I've mentioned two reasons below, so you can decide for yourselves whether or not this would be a deal breaker for you.

TLDR;
CONS
#1 -- No extension option on lock
#2 -- No support of previous in-app purchases

PROS
#1 -- Interface that adjusts to age range
#2 -- Full parental control and remote access to tablet through Amazon account
#3 -- Year free of Kids+
#4 -- Very responsive and durable
#5 -- Support for shared apps such as Netflix and Plex

-------------------

#1
One obvious missing features (for me anyway), is an ""extension"" button.
There was an option for that on the leap pad epic when it locked, where you could extend the time for a set window, be it 15 or 30 minutes. Seriously how often does your child ask, ""Just 15 more minutes"". This would be a seriously useful feature and I can't believe it isn't here.

To extend the time, you actually need to change the time when the device will lock on a general basis, which is covered by only two tabs, weekdays and weekends. Also, Friday night is not counted as part of the weekend, so even if you set the device to lock a little later on weekends, be advised that you'll be in for a fight on Sunday night.

Thing is, once I change the time to say 6:15pm, to allow for that extra ""15 minutes"", I then have to remember to change it back before the following night as otherwise it will only lock at 6:15pm and adding on an extra begged-for 15 minutes would then be 6:30pm. The child obviously won't understand this mistake and you end up in a loop of doom. Just unnecessary admin really.

You can however adjust this remotely within your Amazon account itself and I have pulled this off before when I've remembered with just minutes to spare. Still, no one wants to be James Bond all the time and overall, just not a good user experience. The pause and resume buttons within the parent dashboard, as useful as they seem, do not override the bedtime controls. So thinking that I could just ask the tablet to resume and then manually pause it again 15 minutes later is also a no-go.

#2
Have you previously done in-app purchases and effectively purchased the full version of a game that you would like to share with your child? In-App full version purchases such as those required by Bimi Boo and Pink Fong...

Well sadness is that they simply don't work, your child has to play on the account with which the in-app purchases took place and this defeats the purpose as this is the adult account. Even though you share the apps with the child account, only the free version is shared and not the full version. It is at this point where you begin getting keyboard imprints on your face.

I sat on an amazon help desk chat for well over an hour, was transferred 5 times and they promised to help me and then the last agent being at the actual app store, my final stop, disconnected without initiating the chat. Further keyboard imprints take place.

During that support process I was told I would need to change my child out of the 3-5 age range in order for them to work, not something I wanted to do as it bypassed parental controls for that age group and at the end of the exercise, it was not something that worked anyway. I was then advised to remove and re-add the account, that too did not work. I eventually contacted the creators of Bimi Boo and they told me that the Amazon App store doesn't support the sharing of in-app purchases, I would need to take up the matter with Amazon themselves.

I simply haven't had the energy to revisit this. I do think the only way to do so however, is to be refunded and then do the in-app purchases a second time through the actual device itself. The device is assigned it's own kindle address, but is not otherwise associated with an email address of its own. So I'm not even entirely sure how in-app purchases would work here either.

Anyway, that is $60.00 or so of previously purchased apps which I cannot use unless I repurchase -- gah. I would love to otherwise transfer ownership to that device somehow -- Not like I bought those apps for me anyway.

Rant aside. This is an amazing little device, it is wonderfully responsive and the Kids+ selection is beyond amazing. Everything there is full version and the only 'coins' needed are those you earn in-game. My three year old loves the ""My Hungry Caterpillar"" game where you feed him, play with him and put him to bed for a period of days until he then turns into a beautiful butterfly; after which the whole process begins again. Another firm favourite is ""Little Fox Animal Doctor"" where you cure a number of very cute little characters who are ailing from various illnesses and accidents.

The tablet includes a year free of Kids+ and for a monthly cost of $5 a month, it is definitely worth it for the quality of content, lots of Disney apps too.

My favourite thing about this tablet is that the interface changes based on the age group.
The current group my daughter is in, 3-5 has only images, the next group up 6-12 a has large images and text, finally the teen group pretty much looks as it does in the adult mode. This would actually make a mighty fine Android tablet all on it's own.

In conclusion, other than the cons mentioned above, this is a very worthwhile purchase.",negative

First, the battery life is fantastic. The Fire 7 would drain its battery in a single day if not left on a charger. I tried messing with every setting without success. The kids use the new Fire 8 for a while, leave it off, then use again, and it's still at like 90% charge the next day.

2nd, there is finally a setting for volume control limits!!!! This was the biggest cause of arguments. 2 kids who want their tablet the loudest. Now you can limit the volume.

USB-C charging, so I think I can finally get rid of my micro-USB cables and use the same USBC i have for everything else already.

32GB will definitely come in handy. I was constantly being warned on the old tablets about full memory, but most of the junk you cannot clear out. The only way to fix them was factory reset, and then they would fill up again. Between kids taking videos and instantly downloading any app they click on, memory gets chewed up fast.

Finally, transferring all data from the previous fire to the new one was so easy. No cables required.

One wish - that Amazon would not let them download any app immediately without anything but a single touch. They don't understand the concept of ROM. Sometimes they push things by accident and I have to uninstall it.",positive

I used to get so tired of constantly having to recharge that thing, to the point where it was almost always dead and my child couldn't use it. It also lagged a whole lot.
This one, on the other hand, stays charged for several days, doesn't lag (opening up youtube videos on the other one would end up in this annoying loop of trying to play the video and stopping, but this one is pretty much instant) I think it's double the RAM so that makes sense. My non-verbal toddler has become very good at using this device and can navigate what he wants to do on his own, and it's nice to see him excel at something when he is delayed in everything else. We don't yet know for sure if he is on the spectrum but for parents stuck in that waiting period of testing this has been really good when it comes to choosing what he wants to do and other skills.

I like being able to monitor what they use the most and how child friendly the apps are. From virtual pets to learning videos they have an extensive selection available to them. They can also have books for reading and it’s awesome I can share some of my books with them as well. Over all I love it, very family friendly and useful in a variety of ways. The bumper on this is amazing too. I was skeptical of tablets for kids but I’m glad we gave this a try. It’s very fun for my kids and they are very excited to share some of the random facts they learn from the wide selection of apps on this device.

Now he likes to story’s and watches some pbs shows. For the prime day price I’ll say it’s worth it, but normal full price I’m not sure. Below is a more in depth review
Pros:
I like the kid friendly settings. There is one setting that allows you setup the tablet interface for a younger child( one that can’t read) or one for a child that can. Also like the selection of apps and books. I think specs for the price is good, and the case bundled with the tablet is great. The interactive Dr. Seuss books are a hit with my son, and great for him to start exploring books on his own.
Cons:
The app permission setting is a slight miss for me, I put it to where the child can download something’s but idk what constitutes as something he can or cannot download. I also don’t like that there is a subscription, it’s cheap for prime members 4.99 a month and I think 7 for non prime members. But I think it should be included in the prime membership already. Finally the last con, the possibility of some apps or books not being available if I don’t continue the subscription.",positive

I have no idea how this tablet still works just as good as the day I bought it, or even turns on for that matter, but it’s still going and I just have to say it has served it’s purpose many times over! I never wrote reviews good, or bad, but I felt the need to really brag on this product for its durability and all the entertainment and fun my child has gotten from it.

The possibilities are endless when you are on WiFi, and when we will be off the grid, I load games and videos that can be played/viewed offline. Even the two-year-olds are navigating through games and their favorite movies without assistance.

Why better than an iPad? Well, on an iPad, young kids frequently hit the button on the front or the screen, bumping themselves out of their activities and need assistance getting back in...

She was very excited to see it after I set it up and let it charge. However, we quickly noticed that some of the Amazon Prime Video content she loved and watched on our other tablet was for some reason not available on this Fire kids tablet. I’m talking kids shows such as Blue’s Clues and Bubble Guppies. Instead, you have to add individual videos of those shows (if they are available) from YouTube by going through the settings. I had to watch a YouTube video tutorial to figure out how to do it. The other con is the battery life. It’s supposed to get 12 hours with reasonable use, but I find it gets closer to 6-8. Not a big deal as we always have a charger with us, but something to consider if your child will be primarily using this to watch movies on long trips.
Otherwise, this tablet is excellent. It is very kid friendly and comes with so much content that you would otherwise have to pay for on a different device. We were able to download HBOMAX and Disney+ without any issues. I love knowing my daughter can’t accidentally access the internet and find herself places she shouldn’t be.

EVEN THOUGH AMAZON IS POSTING THIS IS AS A 32G BLACK**

A GREAT LITTLE TABLET FOR WHAT IT IS.

If you're a diehard Amazon customer like I am, then Amazon devices can't be beat for hooking one up to everything that Amazon World offers. And let's not forget Alexa makes it all even easier.

I never thought I'd need or buy a Fire tablet, since I'm already covered with a new laptop, Kindle Reader, 2 Android tablets, and a Samsung phone. My bases were already covered and my nearly 3,000 Kindle books were accessible in several ways. Prime Video and Music work great on all my existing devices, plus I have 2 regular Firesticks and 1 4K Firestick. So why get a Fire tablet?

Well, my two tablets were made obsolete for Kindle when Amazon recently SOMEHOW deregistered both of them from my account and I wasn't able to download the newest Kindle app and repopulate my library. Long story. Enter Fire Tablet HD 8 just when I needed a new device for the Kindle app and the Prime Day price was unbeatable ...

Buying the tablet was really a no-brainer, and a necessity at the time. I ordered the newest 64G WITH ADS and am ecstatic with that choice. After considerable research in comparing capabilities, the 8 was better than the 8 Plus or the 10"" tablet. I don't recommend going lower than 64G even though the 32G is less expensive and memory is expandable. That perk has never worked out well on any device, and we all know that music, movies, and books will gobble up memory faster than a cheetah runs. The white matte finish looks great, but there are things to know before you buy.

** LONG BATTERY LIFE: Surprisingly, I recharge this tablet ONCE EVERY 3 DAYS, despite having it turned on all day with WiFi, and doing alot of Kindle reading.

** SIMPLE OPERATION: After some glitches during setup, and a thorough investigation of the tablet and settings, operation was a snap.

** SETUP ISSUES: I had lots of setup issues due to the endless system updates that were necessary and had to be done in a certain way and order that I couldn't have done on my own even though I'm very savvy with electronics. THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS and it was confusing. That meant being on the phone with tech support to get it all squared away properly. If you're typically Android, this tablet IS NOT ANDROID. IT'S AMAZON. There are similarities, but it's an AMAZON DEVICE THROUGH AND THROUGH.

** SIDEWALK OPTION: Once set up, if you want to opt out of Sidewalk it's very easy within settings.

** ANDROID CONVERTIBLE: For those concerned that it isn't Android and can't download Google Play apps, just go on line for easy instructions on downloading 4 APK files and a launcher in order to turn the tablet into Android and download any apps you want, then create a separate home screen for the Android apps. The current screen is all Amazon apps. Once done, you'll have the best of both worlds combined.

** QUIRKY GLITCHES: I've only had the tablet a few weeks and already there are glitches. The screen occasionally freezes, won't respond to touch, or pages won't open or navigate properly. If you're a heavy reader like I am with an extensive Kindle library and also frequently use Goodreads, there are more glitches. The books that you have ""read"" do not always synch into your GR account on the tablet. My ""friend"" count on GR is also incorrect. GR notifications are spotty. It helps that I double check on my phone app and also email, which are both accurate and up to date on GR notifications.

** A BRICK: Heavier than expected. If you're used to Samsung or Apple, this tablet will feel like a brick and also a bit thick. Expected it to be slimmer and lighter in design.

** SCREEN QUALITY: Picture quality not as sharp or good for movies as my Samsung. You'll notice the difference, but it's still good enough.

** DIFFERENCES: Amazon versions of apps are not quite the same as Android versions. Microphone dictation Notes and Highlights on Kindle books sucks. It doesn't understand most words you say, and you need to close and re-open the microphone to repeat. Very cumbersome and ineffective. This feature works flawlessly on Android, but I often have to type notes manually when I get fed up with the wonky microphone. The whole page layout of books in Kindle App is a bit spotty. Noticed a big difference in the way the Tablet Kindle App operates as opposed to Google Play version on an Android device. Sometimes, I get fed up with the issues, and just read for awhile on my phone when I want to do lots of highlights and notes on a book for reviews.

** DON'T BE AFRAID TO GET THE TABLET ""WITH ADS""! You'll save $15, and can pay it back later if you want the ads removed. The ONLY time I see ads is when I first turn on the tablet on the opening screen. That's it. See my photo of the book ad. No other ads appear during use or at the bottom of the screen as with my Kindle Reader. It's more of a screen saver that swipes away. As long as you are on the tablet and the screen doesn't go dark, no new or additional ads will appear.

** TOUCH SCREEN RESPONSIVENESS: The screen doesn't always respond. Locks up. Not sure if this will get worse or ""it is what it is"". NOT an issue that I have with Android.

** DIFFERENT LAYOUTS: Amazon Prime Video not laid out the same as Android. I couldn't even find my Watch List, until I noticed my profile icon and ""My Stuff"" at bottom of the screen. Why so different Amazon?

** ADJUSTMENT PERIOD: This tablet will take some adjustment, especially if comparing to Android. Although it's geared for Amazon apps, there are more glitches than I prefer, the same as has been happening with all the recent website feature changes on the PC.

It's an okay tablet and perfectly functional especially for Kindle books, music, and Prime Video if you have those subscriptions. 1st 6 months of Washington Post is free. Personally, the tablet needs some improvements and is adequate, but a bit less than expected. It's not the ideal option if you want Android capability, but remember that it is convertible. Because I bought it on Prime Day, I also got a free 3-month, first-time subscription to Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN. I see that offer is still available in another way on Amazon that still might apply to this purchase, so if you're thinking of buying be sure to check the promo with customer service first.

Overall, I'm happy with the tablet, the memory, and the functionality of Amazon World in general which I navigate on a daily basis, but there are some limitations from an android standpoint.

FYI: My photos show the main screen with pre-loaded Amazon apps, an example of a ""free ad"", and one with the Prime Video screen.",positive
331,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 tablet, 8"" HD display, 32 GB, latest model (2020 release), designed for portable entertainment, Black",$69.99,2,"Device: Kindle Fire 8 (10th Generation)

I purchased 8 of these Fire tablets for use in an elementary classroom. They were to be used exclusively to access the Myon ereader app through our district’s Clever page. Sounded simple enough! Yet, I have had the most frustrating experience with educational technology I have ever had.

First, I set up a child’s profile so that I could limit what the students had access to. The child’s profile comes preloaded with 100 videos/apps on the home screen! It was insane! (Note that this is not the “Kids” Fire, just a regular one with a child profile set up.) It took 4 different customer serv agents and about 3 hours to finally find someone who could tell me how to turn them off. It ended up being a simple toggle, so how could that many people not know how? (This was after I had searched through multiple threads online from frustrated parents with the same issue.) FYI, in the child’s profile, toggle off the option to Enable web access. However, this means that you will then have to go in an Allow Content for every app that you do want them to access as well as allow every web page they can go to. For me, not a huge deal because I bought these for one specific purpose, but as you will see below, even that was a ridiculously frustrating process.

After figuring out the toggle solution, I started going into the settings of each Kindle to set them up. On the 8th and final Kindle, it didn’t work. After restarting and then trying to power off/wait/power on, I finally decided to delete the profile and reinstall it. Upon doing this, the child profile interfaces of ALL 8 tablets completely changed. The original wallpaper/setup was single solid light blue page with cloud outline in background. After I reinstalled the profile, the wallpaper was a black/aqua/purple paint splatter with a “For Me”, “Home”, and some other tab. Under the For Me tab were ALL the videos and apps that I had disabled access to. Even though the toggle was set to disable, they were all back and could be opened. I then factory reset the device, and it still didn’t work. I finally tried to create yet another new child profile, and then it finally went back. No rhyme or reason.

So, now to the task of setting them up for Myon. I downloaded the Myon app, but it would not work. I think this was an issue on our district permission side. (And even though I did a press/hold and told it to remove the app from the profile and then completely deleted Myon from my account via the Content and Devices setting of my Amazon.com account, it was still showing up! And if the child tapped it, it became stuck in a loop of trying to install an app that was no longer there.) Anyway, I was told by our Academic Tech dept to go through the Clever app. Guess what – it’s not available on the Amazon app store. So, I had to go through the web. In the Allow Content section of Settings, you can allow specific websites, which is great. However, even though I allowed the website to access Clever, at every step, the child’s profile web browser said no permission. I had to enable every single page the kids will go through to get to their Myon account, and even then they have to know to navigate around an “Uh oh” page that still pops up every time, even though I allowed it.

Because of this, I needed to make step-by-step instructions by taking screenshots so I could print for the kids so they could remember all these steps. However, screenshots taken while in child’s profile cannot be located anywhere, not in the child or adult profiles. (Camera and photo storage had been enabled.) Regular photos taken with the camera could be found in the photos app, and I found an online thread suggesting going through the Files app, but they are nowhere to be found. I can’t take the screenshots in the adult profile because the screen looks completely different. I spent 20 minutes on chat with a CSR this morning only to be told he would ‘notify the team.’ The threads I read about this same issue were from 2020 and 2021, so I’m sure they know and have chosen not to fix it.

My multiple chat sessions were also frustrating. With this particular one, I took the time to write out, in detail, the exact steps I followed, only to have him ask – two separate times - if I had tried something that I had already said I tried. I had this same issue with other CSR chats. These are the least knowledgeable CSRs I have ever dealt with. One, named Jestin, kept telling me to tap the Menu button, and there was not a menu button on my screen. After hanging up with her, I continued to research online, and found the exact script she was using, and it was for a Kindle eReader, not a Fire! She didn’t even have the right device, and she kept getting very angry with me when I couldn’t follow her instructions. She kept me on hold for 10 minutes when I asked to speak with someone else, then came back on and (unsurprisingly) said she couldn’t find anyone else.

I usually have great customer service with Amazon, but they have truly failed with their training related to the Kindle Fire devices. They would have me wait for 10 minutes sometimes, only to come back and ask me to try something that I had already told them I tried.

Almost every single thing I have tried to do with these has required me to spend an inordinate amount of time researching previous threads, chatting online with a specialist, or on the phone. It took 3 separate calls to finally get someone who was willing to take over my Fire so they could see what I was seeing, and even so, I still cannot use them in the way that I need to. You definitely get what you pay for, I guess. Such a shame when teachers have to use their own money to provide these opportunities for their students. I have wasted hours of my time and a lot of my money. I hope I can save another teacher some of this endless frustration.",negative

For the price, you can't beat it, but it's a hack (at best) with mixed results. The HD8 is a perfect size for this kind of application.

There are several aftermarket wall mounts, I'm very happy with the one I got, but I did need to saw it to get access to the volume controls. You will need to access them frequently so look for a mount with exposed volume buttons. My mount has wired USB power but there are several options from POE to mains on most available 3rd party mounts.

Smart Home Dashboard:

The ""show mode"" has a dedicated button on the lower task bar which is handy, but it only surfaces ~50% of your smart devices and lacks support for groups, routines and other functionality. You'll still need to launch the native Alexa App to have the needed functionality. The native Alexa App is UGLY on this device as compared to the stock android version. It can only show in white (light theme), and it's missing a GUI — it looks like a 1990's HTML web page that doesn't have CSS support.

The main challenges I'll share are two-fold; making the user experience streamlined, and integrating with media playback.

User Experience

Shovelware! The price is low because this is jam-pact with marketing shovelware, everything is crammed with upsells, recommendations, and tons of clutter. Getting the GUI to be simple and intuitive requires a lot of setup config to systematically remove all the clutter, but it is possible with dedication. The stock desktop backgrounds are all bright and busy, I had to link to my Amazon photos and upload a solid grey image to replace the crazy graphics because there are no solid color stock backgrounds available in the settings.

There's an upsell when you buy the pad to ""remove lock-screen ads"" you absolutely should buy that option unless you want a crazy distracting flashing panel on your wall.

I suggest enabling the recent apps ""continue"" option on the homescreen setting that creates a large UI component with the last 6 apps used. Much easier to see than a cluster of small icons spread over the desktop. This is a great feature and should be developed more. In my application as a smart home dashboard, 6 featured apps are more than enough.

Media Playback

The speakers on the pad are tiny and cheap, you'll need to bluetooth or hard-wire from the headphone jack to get any acceptable sound. It supports the Alexa multi-room speaker groups feature, but you'll need to add the phrase ""play XXX on the XXX group"" everytime you ask for audio playback, and limit yourself to only a few Amazon sanctioned music services, I think that's a really terrible user experience.

You can bluetooth to another Echo speaker, but if that speaker is set up as a stereo pair, you'll only get it to play on one, not both. Basicly the media playback functionality is sub par and needs a lot of work.

For my application, I elected NOT to use the pad for the Alexa/music speaker group support and instead bluetooth it to my network Yamaha receiver. This decision was partly because I use the PLEX app to serve my home media needs, and the PLEX skill only works locally on any given Alexa device and is blocked from using speaker groups. I'd need to enjoy my music on the tablet's 1/4"" speakers, or bluetooth to an external device.

To complicate matters further this solution required me to use the Yamaha AV Controller android app to remotely choose inputs and receiver volume or—I'd need to run back to the media hub to change the receiver settings defeating the purpose of a remote pad.

Unfortunately, the Yamaha AV Controller android app is not available in the Fire Appstore as is typical with all other audio-gear manufacturer apps. The Fire App Store is for your children. It's only has super-basic apps but with thousands of games for kids—little for the grown-ups—and none for my purpose.

I won't advocate that you violate the Amazon terms of service, but I was able to get the Yamaha AV Controller android app installed after some research and effort. I don't suggest you try this unless you're comfortable with android system alterations, but it is possible to put Google Play Services on the pad with the full play store app catalog. We'll see how long it works until future Fire updates break it.

Bottom Line

Pros:

—Price
—3rd party mounting options

Cons:

—Shovelware!!
—Lack of full device support in ""show mode""
—Ugly native Alexa app
—Sub-par media connectivity
—Limited to Amazon-sanctioned music services
—App store lacking apps for grown-ups
—Limited config/UI options

Someday Amazon will evolve their Echo hardware with added 5.1 abilities and I'll likely toss my receiver in favor of a native 5.1 Echo solution. Running two independent sound systems, with two independent speaker sets isn't a great experience, but clearly Amazon is working towards a better home media environment. They will need to have support non-amazon music/media services, especially local playback services like PLEX as any ""owned"" media is currently blocked in their ecosystem, like many others, I'm not happy paying monthly service fees to rent the media I already own and Amazon has stopped allowing user uploads to their music services—only Amazon-purchased music is available. Nope, not a usable solution!

Even with all the limitations, I believe it's a tortured but acceptable solution for a centralized dashboard if you're willing to do what it takes to get it to look and function properly.

Good luck!",fair
333,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 tablet, 8"" HD display, 32 GB, latest model (2020 release), designed for portable entertainment, Black",$69.99,3,"Okay, let me start by saying that I am currently on my second fire tablet. The first was a gift from my last job and was an Amazon Fire 7 2017 edition. It was, as one would expect from a cheap tablet, very slow and low quality. However, it was still a great tablet for the price. I believe that they were running somewhere around $50-$75 at the time I received it and regardless of the quality, it worked far better than any smartphone I had seen around the same price. I was able to expand memory and I used it for personal and professional services for almost 4 years. So it definitely served its purpose. Last year my wife was tired of me always complaining about how slow it had gotten and how limited it was on being able to keep up with newer apps. So she bought me an Amazon Fire HD 8 2021 for Christmas in the hopes that it would fix the issues I was having with my 2017 model. That brings me to the real point of this review. Having used this tablet for almost a year now I can say again that this is an excellent tablet for the price. I only have a few complaints that I was hoping Amazon had fixed since the 2017 model.

1) The screen is just not bright enough. It's fine when you are inside in a low light area but when you walk outside, especially on a sunny day, you can't see anything on the screen. That's with the brightness level at max and adaptive brightness turned off. (Wanted to clarify for those of you who might think I don't know what I'm doing)
2) The screen lags when switching between apps and when loading apps. This was a major problem with the 2017 Fire 7 but I had hoped that, with all of Amazon's internal hardware and software upgrades that it would be faster but it's about the same still. It's just definitely not made for multi-tasking or gaming really. You can multi-task but it's difficult due to the lag. However, it's a great option for those of you who just want to binge watch your favorite movies and shows on streaming apps and/or use it for ebooks, music, or shopping.
3) The battery life is about the same as my 2017 which was also very disappointing. On a full charge I can usually get about 4-5 hours of solid use before it's almost dead (that was brand new), about 8-10 hours of intermittent use, and if left on but inactive (on standby) you can get up to 3 days on a full charge before it dies. However I will also say that those numbers have not decreased much, if any, over the past 8 months of use. So at least the battery life seems to be fairly consistent.
4) While the tablet is very ""user friendly"", it's not very good for those of you who like to poke around the more technical side of things. You basically have to download a bunch of secondary apps to read or change deeper settings than what you see on the basic menu.

*IMPORTANT NOTICE*
You should never change or alter the programming of any device. Doing this can damage your device, void manufacturer warranties, and may even be illegal in some cases. So make sure you know what the manufacturer as well as your local and federal law allows before you do anything that can alter or potentially harm your device. All repairs, alterations, and any other changes should always be handled by the manufacturer or other industry professionals who are trained to work on your specific device.

To sum it all up, remember that this is a cheap tablet so don't expect your Fire to keep up with the latest iPad because it can't. That being said, it really is a good tablet overall.
Especially when you consider that the closest thing to it from another company would cost you at least twice as much. So for the very last time I'll say, it's an excellent tablet for the price! Thank you",fair

I reluctantly started using it & my daughter told me ways to get Books for Free &/or really good deals on books from my favorite authors or genres (BookBub & EarlyBird I think - she tracks them for me - otherwise I would wind up getting every deal that popped up) ...

She helped me pick out a replacement Kindle Fire & suggested I get one with more storage because I already own hundreds of books ... I liked this one - plus it came in a pretty color ... When I received it my daughter easily walked me through ""restoring"" ALL of my Books & things that I had before on my old tablet onto my New tablet ... Once this was done I was pleased with how much faster I could download new books & with how much more storage I still have available (I had to delete books off my old one if I wanted a new one) ... She showed me how I can turn it long ways (like a wide-screen tv) & helped me adjust my font & brightness - so now Reading is even more enjoyable than ever ... I also got the 3 year accident protection (just in case - I am 83 after all) ...
I Highly recommend this Kindle Fire to everyone ... including stubborn old timers like me ... If you don't have someone to help you set it up (like my daughter) - that's OK too because Amazon has Wonderful Customer Service & they will be happy to help you set it up at no extra charge (they can even take control of your screen to help fix things - But Only if You give them permission - they have helped me several times this way) ... So if your not sure about these things - But Love to read as much as I do ... I say ""For the Love of Reading Take the Chance"" ...

The old one still functions great after five years, but I felt an upgrade was in order, so opted for one the same size. I decided not to go with the bigger model simply because I already had something in that size in the form of my iPad, and going with a bigger one would defeat my reason for going smaller and lighter. So far I've been extremely happy with it. While it's no speed demon, I didn't buy it for that, so I'm very happy with its performance. The big key I see in being happy with this is using it for what it's intended for and not as an iPad type replacement. If you're looking for a speedy platform that can handle all sorts of video play, then this is not for you. If you want something that will handle book reading, watching Prime videos on, or just playing some games, then you will not go wrong with this. The price is hard to beat for what you're getting.

336,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 tablet, 8"" HD display, 32 GB, latest model (2020 release), designed for portable entertainment, Black",$69.99,4,"It's not an iPad. It's not a Samsung tablet. It has some inherent limitations, but for the price, it ain't bad.

The Kindle Fire HD is a tablet. It was designed to be an entry point into Amazon-world, and it is optimized for shopping, games and entertainment (streaming). But it can do a lot more as long as the user understands its limitations.

The biggest limitation is that it is connectable ONLY via Wifi, so anything that you want to do that requires an interface to the Internet requires that you be within range of an accessible Wifi hub. That mean you can't web-surf or stream a video at a campsite in the woods. But it's just as responsive on our home Wifi as my wife's iPad or my iPhone.

The Kindle Fire uses Amazon's proprietary version of the Android operating system, so its basic functionality will be familiar if you are accustomed to an Android phone. However, it also means that the normal channel for obtaining apps is via the Amazon app store. Like Google Play and the Apple App store, the selection of apps is pretty extensive. However, the Amazon collection is limited in some areas - eg, the on-line apps for many local banks aren't available.

While it is not possible to download apps from Google Play to the Kindle Fire directly out of the box, there is a way to augment the basic offering so that apps can be retrieved from Google. Do a Google search for installing the Google Play Store on a Kindle Fire - note that the instructions are a little involved and must be followed carefully.

There are a number of basic apps included on the device - none of which can be removed. Some are simply other versions of more familiar apps. For example, the native browser is Silk - seemingly different from Firefox or Google, but with much the same functionality. Likewise, the native map app is actually Here - which is highly respected in many countries outside North America. After devoting a little 'play time' to these, I found that they are quite usable. Apps that you don't need/want can be clustered in an 'Unused App' folder so that they don't clutter up the screen. E-mail works well.

The price is very attractive, and I was surprised at the apparent build quality - to my mind, it compares very favorably with an iPad. Only time will tell how it holds up. The screen is bright. Sound is ok but if you want higher quality audio, I suspect that you could use the built-in Bluetooth to link to an external audio system.",positive
337,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 tablet, 8"" HD display, 32 GB, latest model (2020 release), designed for portable entertainment, Black",$69.99,5,"Right up front I want to address the negative reviews that tarnish this product because, as usual, people buy this at a very budget price and expect an iPad or Samsung Tablet. It is NOT an iPad or Samsung, it is an Amazon content delivery device. It is inexpensive because Amazon provides the content and they want you to have a cheap way to enjoy it. It is an E Reader, Music Player, Video Player not a full fledged Android Tablet. Like most Amazon devices it has ads on the lock screen. Any other ads are the fault of the apps. It can be massaged to load apps from Google Play but it wasn't designed for that and results will vary. Expecting this to perform like an iPad or Samsung is wishful thinking of the highest degree. If you can't afford an iPad, don't blame this unit. Don't buy it to do anything but read, listen and watch. I've worn out several of the Fire units over the years and I loved them. They are electronic devices and as such are likely to fail at some point. It's reality. I own 2 iPads as well as This Kindle, an old fire (USB port finally died) and a Kindle Paperwhite. They all serve a purpose. I read constantly and sometimes the Paperwhite is right, Sometimes the Fire is right. The iPads are PC replacements for me and do everything I need to run a small business and record music. I don't expect any of the Kindles to be iPads. Warranty is commensurate with value. 90 days is enough to verify operation. After 90 days you're just unlucky or you dropped the unit so many times it gave up. iPads have a 1 year warranty and you pay for it. My last iPad cost me over $500. I expect a lot more from it than I do a Kindle. I apologize for ranting but it sucks that good products suffer because of bad expectations. A Kindle Fire is a great device for what it was intended to do. I don't really like backlit screens for reading, but sometimes they're desirable. I can watch Movies, Listen to Audiobooks, Listen to music, Stream content and read books and magazines. All on one device that has a screen I don't have to squint at to enjoy. All for a very reasonable price. I had some A-hole grab my fire and run while I was getting a drink refill and it wasn't a nightmare... like if he had run off with my iPad.

We enjoyed it for many years. Mostly reading, but also some streaming, games, and internet. The micro-usb port finally failed and we couldn't charge it without doing ""charging cable yoga.""
This new unit has a few ups and downs: UPs: The device is much lighter and easier to hold than the old one. The screen is bright and responsive. It has lots of features for use as a tablet beyond just reading that allow it to compete with Samsung Tab and iPad. DOWNs: The battery does not seem to last as long in the new version. This may help make it lighter, but for moderate use, you will need to charge daily (before, my wife plugged in the old one every few days). Ad-supported price. We got this one for an incredible deal during Prime Day. In the smaller print, the price is Ad-supported, so customer directed ads would appear on the lock screen. Not too bad, but my wife didn't like, so we had to pay Amazon the $15 ransom to remove the ads. (on the up-side, the $15 is a one-time charge, not a subscription).
We are currently having some trouble with a feature that alerts you if moisture has entered the charging port. We keep getting the alert even if the fire tablet has not been near any liquid. I have to do a little more research on that. it may have a defect.
The last comment is that the swipe navigation is a little less intuitive to us than the old device. we are still learning it, so sometimes it can be a little frustrating to get to the screen we want-just like my iPhone!",positive

Everything I can do on a Kindle Fire, I can do on my iPad better. Reading, streaming, e-mails, social media, games... literally everything. The OS on the Fire tablet is clunky in comparison. Even the virtual keyboard doesn't work as well for me.

Oh, and with the Alexa enabled on the Fire, when I use it in the same room as an Echo (which is everywhere in my house), they don't work together very well. I'll say ""Alexa, display the weather on my Kindle Fire,"" my Echo briefly lights up, makes a low beep, and says nothing. The weather doesn't display on my Fire.

Right now my Fire tablet is mounted as a display for showing me the time and weather, and I rarely pick it up anymore. It's essentially an Echo Show now. Maybe if I were going somewhere and was afraid my iPad would get stolen or damaged, I'd take it with me. But I have a Kindle Paperwhite too, and I'd rather have that stolen or damaged than my Fire.

If you've never had an iPad and you want a solid tablet device, by all means save money and get a Fire tablet. But my iPads (I've had 3 so far) have totally spoiled me! I now read from my Kindle library on my iPad's Kindle app. It's much easier to use than reading on the Fire. The Fire's user interface is slow & clumsy. There's a reason the Kindle tablets are priced much lower than an iPad's. My sling bag feels much lighter without both my iPad and Fire since I started leaving my Fire at home every day.

360,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen, 2021 release) | HD smart display with Alexa and 13 MP camera | Charcoal",$99.99,4,"Original review:

This is rather long, so a summary:

My only complaint is that the screen has a VERY FAINT green tint, when compared to feeding the same video to several TVs (all different brands) that I own. Yes, automatic adjustment to ambient light is turned off. Since I didn't buy the Echo Show for video purity, this isn't a big deal, but it is noticeable in a side-by-side comparison, day or night.

I find the constant nagging to do this or that, very annoying. I call it the ""diaper patrol"", following me around offering inane suggestions. After setup, how about leaving me alone? This is not limited to Amazon or Microsoft or Google; it's everywhere: Watch your local news when they do the weather, with the infantile recommendations to wear appropriate clothing. OK, this is a ""thing"" with me. The suggestions on the Google Nest Hub are even more infantile. Are we (as a society) so stupid, that we need this? (Don't answer that).

You need to know that both the Amazon & Google products of this type are by no means general-purpose tablets; they are much more like Kiosks in an airport that let you do very specific things, & that's it. No installing Android apps. Google's Nest Hubs are locked down tight: If Google didn't think of it AND APPROVE IT, you can't do it. There is no keyboard, so even going to a specific web site is a difficult task. Google apparently has a pre-release update that adds a keyboard, but that was last June & I'm on the pre-release list, & no keyboard yet. Ugh. Google can't allow the smartphone keyboard to be used?

The Echo Show is quite a bit more flexible. There is a browser & an on-screen keyboard, which in limited testing seems to do OK; you can easily watch YouTube videos by saying (eg), ""Alexa, show Scheherazade on YouTube"", & then with a single tap select the version of Scheherazade that you want to watch (this works the same way on Google Nest Hubs). This is enough of a reason to buy the Echo Show, as Amazon seems more interested in providing compatibility with other products. This of course is the difference between a company that makes stuff to sell, & a company that sells stuff for no other reason than to collect data on you. Plus, in my experience with Google, they show little interest in updating the firmware in their hardware products to provide new capabilities.

There is one thing that is VERY ANNOYING about both products: If you are watching a live stream (eg, YouTube) & you say ""Alexa [or Hey, Google""], turn off kitchen lights"", Alexa [or Google] will TERMINATE displaying the video, turn off the lights, & then display a graphic of a switch with a ""kitchen"" label, so you can turn the switch back on or off (at least Alexa has an option to disable verbally telling you, what you just asked it to do).

I submit to you, this is the HEIGHT OF STUPIDITY !!! In my opinion, it's more of the infantile approach of so much ""let me help you"" software. Arrgghh! The workaround I use, it that I have a Google Nest Mini next to the Echo Show, to allow me to issue commands that don't INTERRUPT WHAT I AM DOING on the Echo Show. When I used a Google Nest Hub for streaming, I had an Echo Dot next to the Nest Hub, for the same purpose. The ironic thing is that Amazon & Google DON'T interrupt a live feed, IF you give them a verbal command that invokes a ""routine.""

In summary, you need to check carefully between the Google & Amazon products, & make sure it will do what you want, if it is not on the ""approved"" list. In my opinion, the choice is clear: While voice recognition is better on the Google product, the Amazon product is better overall.

Now to my specific reason for buying this: Two years ago, I bought a Google Nest Hello video doorbell. While you can monitor the live video in the Nest apps on your phone & computer, I thought it would be much better to monitor the video on a small, dedicated screen, so I bought a Google Nest Hub. I hated much of it (for the reasons stated above), but it did EXACTLY what I bought it for (& allowed me to interact with any visitors via audio, just like I can do with my smartphone), so I bought a couple more.

Given Google's recent changes in their video storage subscription service, I decided to look elsewhere for a better service & doorbell. I settled on the Ubiquiti G4 Doorbell, with video storage on a local drive rather than in the cloud. It's a $700 investment, but no subscription. It has much better video features. You can stream live video to your smartphone and/or computer via web page, & that is very flexible. Alas, Ubiquiti has no corresponding dedicated video display of their own. However, you can stream their live video feed to any device or program that supports RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol), like VLC.

It turns out that the Echo Show supports streaming from any camera that supports RTSP. In the case of most 3rd party cameras (including the Ubiquiti Doorbell), you do have to load an Alexa skill named ""Monocle"". Once you do that, the Echo Show displays the live video (& sound) from my Ubiquiti Doorbell.

--------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE #1:

As I noted, I bought two new Echo Show 8 (2nd gen) because they could RELIABLY stream my doorbell camera (Ubiquiti G4 Doorbell, using an Alexa skill). Over the November 13-14 (2021) weekend, Amazon updated the firmware in both Echo Shows. Now, they can NOT RELIABLY stream the doorbell camera! When streaming the doorbell (which has a timestamp in the image), the Echo Shows VERY QUICKLY fall behind 10-20 minutes.

NOTHING HAS CHANGED except the Amazon Echo Show firmware update!!! Meanwhile, streaming the doorbell on a PC using VLC continues to work flawlessly, with no delays.

This is part of a pattern at Amazon, of breaking previously working code. I also experience this on my AWS account, where working code in CloudWatch has been broken in at least 2 cases by updates.

Has Amazon heard of ""regression testing""??? I was a software developer for 45 years before I retired, & I'm APPALLED at the current lack of adequate testing in the software industry.

--------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE #2:

Amazon did contact me by phone about my updated review, & has forwarded my report to the development staff. However, given my experiences with Amazon software, I decided to buy a couple of ""Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite"" tablets at Costco for less than the Echo Shows. The Samsung tablets can stream the doorbell using the native Ubiquiti Android app, which also has no delay. Plus, the tablets have other features, like having a battery & thus being portable.

I've returned the Echo Shows to Amazon. New ones are out of stock until February, so maybe this will enable someone to get mine before Christmas.",positive
361,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen, 2021 release) | HD smart display with Alexa and 13 MP camera | Charcoal",$99.99,3,"Edit: I'll bump this up one star because of the representative's solid attempt to troubleshoot my problems. That was a nice surprise, and one of the suggestions did help, marginally. I have also updated some parts of this review with more recent information.

edit 2 (March 9th 2022): I have looked at the Google devices and despite the imperfect experience that I have had with the Show, the Google devices would be an obvious down grade, with the exception of them having better microphones. At this time, the Google devices lack features that are basic on the Shows.

Note that I have the latest update installed as of writing this. Both the voice and the visual ID have been completed. I probably have the most basic Midwestern accent, being born in Iowa.

What I like about the device:

* Drop-ins are great. We occasionally use this as a kind of video intercom system.

* The ability to see my living room in the app if I'm away from home is a nice feature.

* Announcements. While I wish that it would not play the announcement from the device that I speak to, it is nonetheless very useful to announce that I'm on the way home, or that the coffee is done, or so on.

* Voice commands to control smart home devices are SUPER useful. Turning on lights, dimming them, changing their color, or turning on the lights before ever entering a room are all such simple things, yet so useful. Plus, my disabled mother no longer walks into a dark bedroom. That's fantastic.

* I have it set to automatically turn on the living room light at sunrise and at sunset, and to automatically turn them off an hour or two after sunrise. The device knows when Sunrise and Sunset are, so you do not need to enter this information manually nor do you need to adjust it. You simply select either ""sunrise"" or ""sunset"" for the routine.

* Alexa's text-to-voice is superb. I like having it read books to me, and my mother uses it for her morning bible routine.

Yet there have been some frustrating hiccups as well.

With today's technology, it really is just silly that some parts of the experience are forced or otherwise cannot be customized. Yet I find that's the case on this device. For example:

The ""Alexa For My Day"" sometimes feels like an advertisement disguised as a ""try saying"" suggestion, and it can not be removed from the slideshow on the Home screen.

See note about news bug after this paragraph. It's been mostly addressed.

The device will not stop popping banners of news headlines onto screen (update: it's no longer a common bug), despite the fact that all news notifications are disabled and no news sources are selected (update: while this does still occasionally happen, it's become rare). Sadly, these notification bubbles also include an audio ""pop"" when they appear. It's really quite frustrating. This notifications tend to be news regarding the current major world event, but it will occasionally also include sports. It seems to pick a random sports team from a random sport when this happens. I also have all sports related news disabled.

Update:
As of August 2022 the news notification bug still occasionally occurs, but it's presently considerably less frequent than it used to be. It's no longer multiple times per day, and instead may be once or twice in a week. I still have gone out of my way to eliminate any news sources so this shouldn't ever be a thing, but, it's no longer driving me up the wall.

Contacts cannot be deleted from the Alexa app or from the device. I have multiple (duplicate) entries of both myself and my mother, and a couple of my sister, and there's nothing that I can do about this other than to disable the option that imports contacts. Yet even when disabling that option, while it does delete some duplicates, my mother still has two or three duplicate entries in my contacts list. Those duplicates cannot be deleted nor merged, and of course disabling the option to Import also removes some unique contacts. These duplicates make sending messages via Alexa a frustrating experience, so we've simply given up on using that feature.

Some activity history, such as songs that were played, seem impossible to remove or to hide. The device accidentally played a song instead of doing something else, and now the suggestion to replay that song is forever presented in the Home screen rotation despite the fact that I've listened to many other music tracks since then. I disabled the Music slide from the home screen rotation in order to get rid of it, but why can't we just delete or hide items from our play history?

Motion detection by the camera is quite slow and / or infrequent to respond. It reacts so uncommonly that I've forgotten that the routine exists, and it surprised me when the lights turned on when someone moved in the living room. I've since deleted some of these routines as they were too unreliable.

There is no twitch.tv support despite Twitch being an Amazon owned company. That's just weird, and a bit frustrating to me, personally, since I use that service quite a bit. If you want to watch Twitch on your Show device then you're out of luck. It isn't happening.

I've also ran into some bugs. If these bugs are ever fixed (and I'm still using the Alexa devices) I'll update this review. For now, here's what I've ran into:

Note: The goodnight routine bug is partially fixed. I no longer need to tell it to play the sleep sound, so my bed routine has become ""alexa goodnight"" followed by ""alexa turn off the screen"". It's quite silly that turning off the screen still can't be a part of the routine, but this is better than it used to be.

The number on the notification bubble that shows that you have X number of unread notification does not clear, even after you delete all notifications. I've grown to ignore the unread notifications bubble because 9 times out of 10, it's just a number that's become stuck and there are no notifications.",fair
362,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen, 2021 release) | HD smart display with Alexa and 13 MP camera | Charcoal",$99.99,5,"Ok, I'll start by saying I'm a big fan of the Alexa devices. I bought the first Echo many years ago (still my favorite) and have own almost every model since. I just keep trading them in. I now own about 7 of them & the Echo TV box. The Echo Show 8 & 10 are the best of the best if you want a screen.
I bought this Echo Show 8 to replace an Echo Show 5 that never worked properly. I had it in a small corner on a night table. It never understood what we were saying & did what we asked about 20% of the time.
The Echo Show 8 (2nd Ed.) is a big upgrade. It understands most of the time & usually does what we ask 1st attempt.
Our primary use for the device is to control the lights, A/C & fan as well as wake us & let us know if someone is at the door while we're in bed.
It does all of this very well & understands us about 80% of the time.
My biggest criticism is the annoying suggestions it continually makes that have nothing to do with what we want or what we've done in the past. That combined with its inability to answer a question. What time does the bank close, who wrote this song, global questions, historical questions, pretty much everything. In general the Echo devices seem to try to make up an answer rather than just browsing the internet for the answer.
I've just about given up on them for that & usually just ask my Android phone. It always knows the answer.
Amazon, the greatest improvement you can make to these devices is to just give them the ability to browse the Internet for information.
Other than that, I do love these devices. They're a pleasure to use. Alexa is cute as hell & I often find myself saying thank you when she does something because I enjoy the responses. I'm amazed at how human the developers have made her responses get voice intonation correct & actually creating a personality for her. Great job guys!
As for privacy concerns, sorry, I just don't care. My life is not that interesting that anyone would really care what I say and I like the idea of getting targeted advertising. I'm going to get ads anyway, they might as well be for things that interest me.
If you're interested in getting one of these the Echo Show 8 is a great place to start. Consumers gave the 1st edition a slightly better score. I own both & don't really see a difference except for the USB port on the back of the 1st Ed which I've never used.",positive
363,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen, 2021 release) | HD smart display with Alexa and 13 MP camera | Charcoal",$99.99,4,"I love the Echo Shows and currently have a 5, 8 and 15 in my house. I plan to purchase an Echo Show 10 and will be on the lookout for similar products in the future. I love the integration with each other and with my other Amazon smart home products (such as the thermostat and ring products).

However, my biggest complaints with the Echo Shows (and this is a problem in every version I have) is the voice recognition. My Echo Show 15 feels like I have to scream at it in order for it to pick my voice up. My Echo Show 8 will often mistake what I said, even though I have setup Voice ID and have spent a decent amount of time talking to it. This can be especially frustrating when asking it simple questions or trying to accomplish simple tasks like adding an item to a shopping list. Since I usually have my phone on me it makes me feel like I should have just asked Siri to add it, as the overall time it took to complete would have been faster. If Amazon can improve this aspect of the devices, I will be MUCH happier with the entire Echo Show line.

The other issue I have is with the camera features. Drop Ins seem to work almost every time, without any issues at all. Live View however, works about 50% of the time on the Echo Show 15 and 8. I could only get it to work once on my Echo Show 5 and had to send it back for a replacement (haven't tested it again since I received my new one). I see others mentioning this issue online and the recommended solution is always the same, try turning off the camera features and turning them back on. I have repeatedly tried this and have tried using the Live View from multiple devices, and the success rate is very low. It's to the point now that even if I don't want to make a call to another Echo device, I will still just use the Drop In feature because I know Live View won't work, or will take multiple attempts before it actually connects.

Overall though, I feel like these issues are mostly software related and could be fixed with future updates. The product is awesome, particularly if you bought in to the Amazon ecosystem and can make use of the easy integration of all the different Amazon devices.",positive
364,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen, 2021 release) | HD smart display with Alexa and 13 MP camera | Charcoal",$99.99,5,"At first I was a bit apprehensive based on feedback from others and watching several YouTube videos about blah blah blah. So i took the plunge and bought one of these just to test it out and see how it performs as I wanted my own experience to be the judge, and boy oh boy, i am officially impressed.

SOUND
The sound is clean and you would not believe the high volume that is coming out of this device. I have mine set to about a little over quarter and it is just good for everything on a daily basis.

SCREEN
I think the 8 inch screen hits the sweet spot, not too big, not too small. Its clear, the touch response is good so far with no complaints.

ALEXA
Damn, that woman can catch her name every time, all the time. She doesn't miss a beat and she probably misunderstood what we asked her to do but after the basics she is quite capable of executing skills.

MY USAGE
I have this device connected to my home security cameras (LOREX) and the integration is very good. I can ask Alexa to view different cameras and I'm not disappointed by how she handles requests.
The ""Drop In"" feature is nice as sometimes I check in with my family when I'm not at home.
YouTube is functional, in that you have to ask Alexa to open YouTube and then you manually input your choices, Netflix goes through a similar process, but all in all it works and its functional.

NOTE
I liked it so much that i bought another one for the Kitchen.

NOTE 2
I found it so useful that i bought 2 for my in-laws to also view their security cameras and YouTube.

CONS
(1) I'm not a big fan of the split screen keyboard... probably there is a way to adjust it and I probably haven't figured it out as yet.
(2) Sometimes the cameras open on screen like a picture in picture and i have to pinch to zoom. It does this sometimes and again its probably a setting i have to adjust.

Overall i think this is a very good device based on your use-case and it works well for me.",positive

One in the dining room/kitchen and two in the bar/family room connected in stereo. Our daughter has an Echo Show and when we visit them my wife, who never uses our Echo Dots, learned to use the Echo Show because it's in the kitchen and she likes to cook while we're there. So I asked her if she would like to have one at home and, to my surprise, she said yes. So I ordered one, set it up, and unfortunately it would not work. It just refused to go through the update process and just kept looping back to the beginning of setup. So I exchanged it, (I love Amazon) for a different one and this one works perfectly. We put it in the kitchen and moved the one that was there into our bedroom. My wife loves it. Yesterday she was happily baking bread while rocking out to Garth Brooks and using the timer feature to time the bread. We love the Echo Show. It does everything that the Echo Dots do and so much more. We have the 8-inch model. The picture is large enough to see and read across the room, the image is sharp and crisp, and the speakers sound great. I've ordered a stand for it to raise it up a bit and to be able to adjust the angle and tilt of the screen.

I was about to buy another one when I got an add saying that I could pre-order a second gen. I could not find a good comparison anywhere so I asked myself, should I pay 20$ more for an unknown. I did and spoiler alert, it is worth it, kinda.

Positives:

- The new camera features are great. The camera can track you and center you for video calls, real time, and it does it accurately.
- Speaking of the camera, the camera upgrade is insane. Went from 1MP to 13MP.
- The processor is supposed to be much more powerful. Looking at the new camera features, understanding where you are in a group of people and tracking you accordingly, it is noticeable. However, given that a lot of the actions on the device are web based, there is not a huge difference on other apps. The responsiveness of the touchscreen is perhaps a bit better but it was good to begin with.
- The unit will go to low power mode when idle, helping you save a penny here and there…
- Several privacy features. The stop listening button we have grown used to. The camera can be manually closed shut for privacy. When remote viewing through the show, there is a warning message, etc...

Negatives:

- Amazon did not learn from their mistakes. Just like with the Show 10”, the power cord is white for every unit, whether the unit is black or white. The camera shutter, is white too.
- The 3.5 jack is gone.

Other thoughts:

The sound quality___

One of the items on my wish list for this one was an improved audio quality. The sound quality improved over the previous gen, I think, but I would say its marginal if that, not enough to even be sure it did.

The white cord___

What I hate the most about my Echo Show 10 is the white cord on a black unit. Since I fell for it with the Show 10 and white would go well with my decor, I preemptively went for a white unit, to eliminate the eyesore, in case Amazon did not learn from their mistakes. To a certain extent, I was secretly hoping the cord would be black so I could swap it with my Show 10” and fix two problems with one move. Nope, its white.

Even with a warning from me that it could happen, a friend went for the charcoal one and he is still fuming. So, if you are like me that the white cord on a black unit would drive you crazy, and you are going for it, order the white one.

The environment___

If you are still on the fence about this one, be aware that 2nd gen uses recycled materials on its manufacturing. To me this is a selling point.
_____________________________
TLDR,
1) If you use it a lot for video calls, the improved camera and improved camera features, makes it a worthy upgrade. If this is not your cup of tea, waiting for a prime day sale on a previous gen might be better.
2) If having a white cord on a black unit is something that would drive you crazy, get the white one or go for the previous gen.

Updated (JUNE2022): It appears that Amazon did learn from their mistakes. Another friend I warned about the cord, told me he didn’t really cared and went for the black one. Well, he got it with a black cord. Given that to me this was the worst negative, I just raised it one star.",positive

First of all, if I could go back I would not have started with Ring. It's not worth the hassle of waiting 30 min to an hour for tech support when you've been on with them for days for the same issue! Over and over. They will warranty the item, but you have to pay for installation again! This camera does what it's supposed to for the most part. I've had to reset all of them a few times which took a couple of hours. Update: I had to go out of town for two days and leave my dog behind at the house with a pet sitter coming in. I was able to watch him in between her visits. I could talk to her through the cameras while she was there. The cameras did their job. It was a much source of comfort for me. I have 2 cameras outside and two inside. One upstairs with the cats and one downstairs with the dog. One at the front of the house and one on the side. A chime notifies me of motion on outdoor cameras. I know when someone is coming down my driveway. The camera sees it and it rings the chime. The dogs have learned that when the chime goes off, someone is coming! It's actually pretty cool. I just wish when there was a problem that it was easier to get a hold of customer support. It's a major downside. I still haven't had the new doorbell installed yet. It was only in for 3 months and it needed replacing.

I figured with so many features, there had to be something that wouldn't work as expected. But sure enough, it all currently works nearly flawlessly. This is as close to 100% perfection as I'm going to find.

Why did I give it only 4 stars? Maybe I skimmed too much of the product information, but I wanted to use the Echo Show 2 that I purchased separately to monitor the camera feed all day. But I found out that when I had the camera view on the Live stream, it would end the stream after about 10 minutes automatically. I tried to find answers as to what was wrong. Why is it ending the Live stream after this amount of time? I have to keep telling Alexa to show me the camera after 10 minutes. Still can't find the answer to this except that this is just a feature of the system. The official site mentions that it is part of the programming. It is not designed to show the Live feed for longer than 10 minutes straight. I'm stuck with that one little flaw. And this is true with watching it on my iPhone and desktop as well.

But I'm not entirely disappointed because I still love the other features so much and how well they work so far. It's only been 24 hours since I installed it, however. The floodlight senses motion fine and covers more distance than I expected. The clarity in the distance is much better than I expected. The view is much wider than I expected.

My order arrived sooner than scheduled. The support from RING has been excellent and they answer the phone 24/7.

I chose the wired unit for reliability and a white one because of our Phoenix Arizona hot sun.

I installed it vertically on the outside wall of my garage, about 8 feet from the floor of the driveway, facing my 2-car driveway and street. I ran a 3-wire round power cord from an AC outlet in the ceiling of the garage – about 15 feet to the wall. Measuring the location of where the unit is to be mounted is VERY important. I carefully calculated where the hole would be drilled through the exterior wall and stucco to the inside of the garage wall. I bought a 12” x 3/8” concrete drill bit and plastic 4” round box.

The hole through the wall had to be reamed out a little for the power cord to easily get through the hole, a 7/16” or ½” bit would have been better. After drilling the hole through about 13” of stucco and wood for the extension cord, I cut the plug off and poked it through to the outside. I mounted the 4” plastic round box with long screws, stripped the cord and 3 wires and wired it up per instructions.

The next morning, I discovered one of two tabs broke off on the plastic 4” round box and the unit was hanging with only the wire and the bottom tab. DO NOT USE A PLASTIC 4” Round Box. I bought a metal 4” round box and rewired and remounted the unit onto the wall. Be sure to use proper screws for mounting the 4” Round Box to the wall or surface.

The unit is very heavy and there are only 2 tabs on the round box to attached it to whatever surface its being mounted on. The metal 4” Round Box with ½” threaded outlets comes with the screw plugs for the holes that will not be used.

The panhead screws that came in the unit for mounting the metal bracket to the round box were too high and did not allow the unit to seal completely with the foam rubber gasket against the 4” round box. I used two Truss-head screws. Again, the unit is heavy, so be very careful when handling and mounting it.

I sealed the 4” round box to the stucco wall with liquid nail to prevent rain from getting into the power cord and into the back of the unit. I painted round box and touched up the stucco.

Now the functions and performance… I’m disappointed in the resolution of the image when zoomed in to enlarge the image of a person. The camera apparently does not have lenses, so the depth of field is very small. The feature to physically select the motion detect area is nice. The app is a little confusing to use but after playing with it, it’s works fine. The on-off selectable motion alarm is interesting. It has a recorded female voice that says “Hi, you are currently being recorded” when the motion detect is triggered.

Overall, this unit is well worth the price and the time to install it. It has provided a nice level of comfort for added outside home security and links with my RING doorbell. I will know more about its environmental quality after a couple summers and rainy seasons. I subscribed to the Plus option for $100/year with video recording of all devices at home. I get shared neighborhood alerts on security issues that RING products detect which is nice to know what is happening around our area.

Customer Feedback to RING: I suggest you revise your installation video to state to only use a Metal 4” Round Box and replace the panhead screws with a flatter head screw. Also, the resolution with a zoomed in image is very important for visual identification. Please improve this in future revisions of this product. I would pay extra for improved resolution.",positive

375,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus with motion-activated 1080p HD video, Black (2021 release)",$159.99,5,"After three houses on our street were broken into, I decided to invest in a home security system and lighting around the perimeter of our house. I did a lot of research over a few days and read countless reviews in order to find the perfect options for my household. I was going to go back to ADT but they were booked up and couldn’t come around for a “quote” for three weeks, so I opted to try the Ring Floodlight with camera. Because we live on the end of the street next to the Bayou (maybe 25ft. from our house) that opens up into the lake, it is really dark and we are secluded from everyone and everything, which is perfect for criminals. At night, it’s pitch black outside and you can’t even see your hand In front of your face much less anything else. The Ring floodlight has eliminated the darkness. I’ve been using it for about a month now and my family loves it !! When it detects motion, it automatically turns the lights on at night on and starts recording. During the daytime, it just records so you don’t waste the light. I love that when I hear the unique chimes that I can check what’s going on at my house while I’m at work. We feel so much safer and I notice less traffic coming down our street since we’ve ordered them. I thought it would be a hassle to set up since I knew I’d be the one to do it but it was as easy as I was informed it would be. I am thrilled with this purchase and can’t wait to order more items from Ring to complete our home security safety!! By the way, a few nights ago I was coming in the house after getting off work and it instantly started recording since it sensed my presence. I looked around before getting out of my car and didn’t see a thing. Watching the video clip the next day at work, it showed a deer in the background. That’s how good the lighting, night vision is. I hope my review has helped you!",positive

Camera works pretty well in daylight and at night. I have no complaints about the hardware and quality! The lights can be adjusted from very bright, to just over dim, and have a good range of motion.

I use my echo as a hub fro my ring devices, So no need to buy a ring hub if you have the right echo. This will also allow you to control the lights and view the camera within the Alexa app which is a nice feature. (Although you have to give the Alexa app access privileges to your microphone)

CONS
As soon as my initial Ring Protect trial ended, I started getting tons more motion notifications. I would get random motion alerts, one day I got about 40 in a two hour time period. After adjusting the sensitivity i still get way more notifications then when the Trial was active so i wonder what’s up with that and if it’s some scheme to get me to buy the ring Protect. 😡

At this price, you should have the option to record locally instead of paying for their service. Security cameras are pretty much useless without having the recordings 🤷🏽‍♂️

I wish it would integrate with Apple and allow shortcuts to be used: “Turn on the Floodlights” or allow a widget so you can see the video feed without having to open the app

If you want to use this within the Alexa app, you have to allow Alexa microphone permissions.",positive

1) no ability to set a package zone for packages left at my back door...only available on doorbell cameras

2) when motion happens in separate zones, was hoping the zone name would be in the alert. I care more about one zone than the other.

3) the AI needs to recognize the members of the household so as not to flood alerts with ""person at the back door"" when it's me - whether I'm coming home from an errand or out there grilling dinner. Too much noise, but i don't want to disable alerts for when it's not me.",positive

381,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - Black",$49.99,3,"I own 5 Ring indoor cams, along with a Ring Elite doorbell and a stick up elite POE cam. This is just my input regarding these cams as I have been testing them and using them for quite sometime. First thing is not every indoor cam works the same, some arrive with older firmware and need updating. Plug in close to your router and do the full set up and do your updates. Once you add the cam to the app and it’s working well, unplug it and move it to the area you want to monitor. Do your set up either by mounting it or setting it on a shelf. Get the angle of view your looking for and then set up your motion zone and sensitivity. Make sure you check the “health” box to see your signal sensitivity. If you are using a mesh router network, you should reconnect to the closest link for it, if not you may have to reconfigure to the nearest of it isn’t automatic. Make sure you turn on the snapshot option as well. If you don’t want to have the indoor cams record or send alerts while your home, you can turn that ability on and off with the new quick access buttons in the app. You will get 30 days of free recording for ALL your cams, with each cam you buy. So if you decide to buy one a month, till you cover all your angles in the home, you will literally get an additional 30 days for every cam on your network covering the 50 days of cloud storage for free. Why not use this option while it’s still available. After you cover your needs, opt for the yearly service. I have 5 indoors cams, covering almost 4000 sf. I love that I can drop in and watch over the home as well as hear and talk through the cams. Night vision in a room is great too. Makes a great baby cam as well. I have had 2 indoor cams give me problems in the past, either dropping off my network, or the snapshot option not working. If you have read my ring reviews before, I am well versed in networking and I have found that some ring reps want to always point the finger at every else but their devices. I can say I have found problems in a couple of their devices and once they were replaced, the problem was solved. Don’t allow them to drive you insane, the community forums are good but they only can go so far for help as well. Sometimes a quick swap of the unit with a new one solves the problem. Amazon has always backed me and they are truly behind their customers.

4/2020: I wanted to be able to watch the main entrance and hallway in my home, have an eye level view, no wires at all showing, and nothing that stood out of place. So review the attached pics, maybe this install will gravitate people who are inclined to custom installs, know there is no limit to what you can do. Just plan out your work and never rush. I was able to recess an indoor cam into my wall, and still provide me with all the aforementioned needs. I used a double electrical box as it provided me the necessary room without modifying the box. I used an indoor/outdoor ring power supply and reused the indoor cam plug on the power supply as it fits perfect and locks in. I obtained 120v power from a nearby electrical outlet, and brought my wire into the box from behind the wall. I mounted the ring power supply on the back of the electrical box, and prepped the box to accept the camera. I created a clear acrylic template and was able to use that to cut out the blank wall plate. What’s really nice is I can still unscrew the wall plate and easily remove the cam if I need to do a reset or adjustment. This solved many issues for me and still provided an eye level video shot of persons entering the front door. Since the ceilings are 12’ high, mounting the cam at the ceiling with a downward angle wasn’t conducive in getting a good facial shot. This is just one example of several I have designed myself to combat issues most of us have dealing with wires, angles, placement, etc.

11.21.20: After almost a year of Ring use, I have to say I am disappointed in the Ring community forum, their tech support, and products. Just recently, I had two of the ID cams drop offline. No matter what I did, no luck getting them back to work. I actually unplugged a back up ID can and went to move it, that one also dropped offline and never came back up. Tech support was of no help, and the community forum mod just tells you to call in.

I would think using 10 ring cameras, I know a little about them. Based on my research, they connect to WiFi, but can’t get to the internet. It appears that there is a high probability that my ISP is blocking the camera for possible threats, even though I turned off my firewall, set up a DMZ zone, and just about created a WiFi bridge to push the Ring cameras too, they still won’t work. They don’t play nice since the last firmware update. So as they fail, I am replacing them with another company. Honestly, I don’t care what brand I use, as long as it works. Read the community forums, and see for yourself. Setting up cameras is not really that difficult, troubleshooting isn’t either as long as you have full control of all devices. Ring doesn’t allow for device control outside of normal settings. Also, Ring devices CAN NOT, be wiped clear of stored memory setting for your home network. It’s embedded in the device. Even if you remove it from your home network, and sell it. It still has your network mirrored in its memory. Found this by pure chance. At the very lease you should have the cams IP address to clear out stored info and reset it. Wow",fair
382,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - Black",$49.99,5,"Well you have to understand is that when you buy a ring camera you have to buy a subscription in order to keep your videos that get recorded. If you don't, you can only detect motion as it's happening. And if you're like me who because I'm home and I know what motion is detecting I don't always look at the camera. But I could miss something at work, which ended up happening when my grandfather broke his leg because he had fallen but I didn't know how since I didn't record the video and I didn't check the camera at the time that it set off the motion detector.

But what I like about the camera is that the quality sounds pretty good in my opinion. Of course it doesn't sound like someone's right in the room with you talking as if everything is normal. But it does sound clear. I think the night vision camera is really good and I think the video quality is pretty decent. I usually can see everything going on in my house when it's happening.

In fact, the power adapter that came with the cameras was for 110-220V/50-60 cycles, so there was no problem at all. See the picture I uploaded.
I downgraded the overall rating, even though I awarded five stars for the night vision, motion detection and picture quality I was a bit disappointed in the vertical field of the picture.

390,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor – wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera with two-year battery life and motion detection, set up in minutes – 5 camera kit",$249.99,4,"Due to my answer in the QA section receiving many endorsement, i decided to give it a bit more detailed review after 2 weeks into owning the Blink setup. I came from Simplisafe, and i still do have simplisafe's alarm system, but due to their lack of outdoor camera solution, i finally decided to pull the trigger on the latest Outdoor blink and try out the Mini blink as well.

First thing's first, the new Outdoor Blink cam works mostly as advertised but the indoor Blink Mini is junk. Read more about the Mini below. But first the Outdoor (good)

Blink Outdoor:
Motion recording speed & Delay:
The Outdoor cam's trigger time is almost instant, in fact, I noticed that it even records a second before entering the frame. which tells me that it might be doing some kind of constant recording into the cam's onboard volatile memory as cache, and once motion is triggered it starts encoding the data and dumps it onto the cloud. So the trigger time is almost instant. However, note that there is a 5 second delay from what's happening Live vs what you see on your phone. so that delay is between Trigger --> Encode --> Cloud --> Decode. I""d imagine that if your Cam is connected to a wifi bridge as oppose to directly to the main router, the delay could be longer than 5 seconds. Compare to Simplisafe cam, the Live vs View delay is about the same. and the trigger time is about the same too.

Motion sensor & sensor distance.
the motion sensor distance in the Outdoor cam is less than 25 ft. despite what the feature ad would tell you. i have 4 Cams (3 outdoor setup at an angle pointing down 45 degree angle, and 1 in the garage looking pretty much straight flat at my car), 3 of the outdoor ones could pretty much trigger 15~20ft out, while the one in the garage struggles to even trigger at 15 ft. You should also take night vision into account. in NV mode, the distance is 5ft shorter. increasing the IR blast in NV will somewhat mitigate the problem but at a cost of battery drain. i tried moving the cam in garage from pointing 45 degree down to looking almost straight horizontal to improve motion sensing to a degree. So if you have trouble with the motion sensor, try that. Compare to Simplisafe's cam, the Simplicam seems to have farther motion sensing distance. But then again, Simplisafe still doesn't have an outdoor solution.

Speaker/Mic
the speaker and Mic quality is really good. it doesn't sound overly tiny like you would expect and is loud and clear. compare to Simplicam, the Blink Outdoor has better sound and mic.

Wifi Wireless
i was surprised how well the wireless works. lots of complains in the review about wireless distance, not sure if they're genuine. but my farthest cam is about 80ft away from my main router thought a living room, a dining room and a garage and garage door (just shy of the max 100ft advertised in the spec), i am still able to get above 33% wifi N signal. But i think a lot of this ""might"" depend on the quality of your Wifi router. i spared no expense on my home wifi. So my router is 3x3 beam forming top of the line AC router that also has a very wide 802.11 N coverage. it can reach far and carry lots of bandwidth. my advice is invest in a quality wifi router with the most bandwidth and range you can afford. Note that the cams and module only supports 802.11 N. Compare to Simplicam, the wifi signal reach is about the same, if not slightly better than the Simplicam.

AC Wireless.
part of the charm and strength about the Blink Outdoor is its battery powered wireless nature. Only time will tell how long my Cams will last. I will update this review and reflect the score once my first set of battery run out. My gut tells me it'll be less than 2 years, well less. but i'd be happy if i can get even 1 year out of those cams. Note that the advertised 2 year battery life from Amazon is based on roughly 2 mins of video footage per day per cam. One of my busiest cam facing out the front door is seeing 2~3 times that amount.

Resolution/video quality
the resolution of the cam and video compression is really good. compare to those legacy 480p outdoor cams, this was a big step up. but compare to the simplicam, i would say the image looks slightly sharper than the Simplicam. but note that true 1080p resolution is only possible with high quality video record setting, which can chew up your battery and storage. Amazon's 2 year battery life is based on medium setting, which is actually 720p. but even at the medium setting, i still find the image to be very sharp and clear. going from medium to high (1080p) setting yield ""some"" improvement viewing on a smart phone. you likely won't be able to find big difference viewing it on a smartphone unless you view both videos on a large monitor. oh which btw, currently there's no app available for desktop computers. you'll have to either download the footage or pull the backup off your thumb drive to view it on a dekstop.

Storage
ok, this is the most contentious and messed up part. the ad made you believe that you don't need to subscribe to cloud and able to store locally. what they don't explain to you is that local storage is only a secondary option on top of the cloud subscription. so you CANNOT, at least at the point of this review, store your recordings directly to the USB thumb drive and read off of it directly. how the Blink cam works right now is everything gets dumped to their cloud server, and when you view the footage, it reads off their cloud server. the USB thumb drive is just there to backup ""from their cloud server"" ""once a day"". there is no way for you to have the cams upload recordings directly to the thumb drive locally and view them from your phone wirelessly off the USB Thumbdrive. There're a lot of people asking about this question on forums and, like me, only found this out after the fact. It's not a deal breaker, but it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Why not just come out and say it. It's simply misleading. if you go to their website, and dig, and i mean really dig, you'll find that there is a way to run it without subscription. but any motion trigger or live views will not be recorded. So what's the point of local storage? it's almost like they just want to find a way to cramp that ""local storage"" wording into their ad to sell you the product only to find out that it's a secondary backup on top of a pay subscription.

Now onto Blink mini (junk)

Blink mini on the other hand. To put it simply is junk or an opportunity wasted. the Blink Mini has a long standing bug that plagued the camera for at least 2 years, and the dev team still hasn't released a fix. The issue with Blink Mini is that it fails to trigger motion recording coming out of night vision mode when you enter the room to turn the lights on. the dev team explained that something to do with the cam goes into freeze mode when it attempts to wake itself out of night vision to do recording. for that reason, it's pretty much trash if you intend on using the Mini as any kind of indoor security cam. I originally intended to use the Mini in my garage to monitor my prized stallion. But i literately would go into my garage and walk up to the car and no motion or recording is triggered. Dev has acknowledged this issue since late 2018 and said in 2019 forum post that firmware update is coming to fix this. it is now end of 2020, i would not count on it. The only reason i kept my Mini and ordered another Outdoor cam for the garage is so that in any case when we go on vacation, i can set the Mini up in the living room to do live view. But if you're thinking about getting the Mini for motion triggered security cam indoor, forget it. don't say i didn't warn you.

Software UI/UX
the interface for the app is easy to use and more organized than many other similar services. clips are organized with usable filters at your disposal. the motion sensing manual dead zone configuration is helpful, although likely not too useful if you're using it outdoor, since the ""motion sensor"" distance (not wifi distance) is well shy of advertised 25ft.

OVERALL
the new Outdoor blink has a lot going for it. If they can fix their advertisement wording, or better, let us have the option to record directly to the USB Thumb drive and be able to view the recording from our devices directly from the thumbdrive. it'll then be a True local storage solution. the only reason i ditched my Simplicam is because i really wanted to have smart Cams covering my house outdoor. Been 3+ years since Simplisafe said that they would come out with an outdoor solution. But till this day, still nothing. i just got tired of waiting. When i saw the new Blink Outdoor being advertised for Black Friday, i really wanted to give it a try. i would say the barrier to entry is minimal. the Blink hardware given the discount that amazon has been giving out, is worth the shot. Without the deep discounts, i am not so sure. They just need to improve the motion sensor distance coverage, and let us really use the USB thumb drive for storage. In a sea of smart home security market today. Amazon really needs to do more to win over customers and not only that, to keep them there. If they can combine Ring with Blink, i might just ditch my Simplisafe completely and go Ring to combine their alarm system with Blink. If they can do that, i don't mind paying the $10/month subscription. But at its current state, they still have work to do to win over customers.

i will update the review on the battery life",positive
391,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor – wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera with two-year battery life and motion detection, set up in minutes – 5 camera kit",$249.99,3,"Empecemos por decir que lo que ofrece el producto es lo que vas a obtener ni mas ni menos.

El producto es totalmente inalámbrico , lo que le da ventajas a la hora de una instalación limpia rápida y sin cables a simple vista.

La conexión vía remota desde el celular a través de app es genial y muy fluida, cuando quieres ver los videos, aunque la conexión con mi dispositivo echo show 5 a sido casi imposible para el control de voz y para la visión en vivo tiene un delay bastante desagradable.

La duración de las baterías es excelente tengo 5 camaras instaladas y una de ellas esta en la entrada del conjunto residencial, lo que hace que diariamente este por las 70 notificaciones de movimiento promedio con sus respectivos videos y aun después de un mes dice que esta sobre el 70% de vida.

Las notificaciones son casi que en tiempo real max unos 10 a 15 seg después de la detección de movimiento llega la notificación a la app de celular, pero la conexión con alexa en mi caso a sido terrible y bastante deprimente porque me decidí por el producto justo por esa función y no he podido darle solución a los errores constantes entre alexa y el skill de blink.

Ahora indaguemos mas en lo tecnico y por lo cual me ha decepcionado un poco el sistema.

Este no es un sistema de vigilancia de video es mas en mi opinión un sistema de alarma de movimiento con capacidad de grabar el evento que activo la señal de alarma, aunque muchas veces ese video termina por frustrarte mas y a continuación explico el porque

El sistema solo puede grabar entre 5 seg y 60 seg de grabación y aunque a veces 60seg es mucho tiempo, tiene una opción que permite parar el video antes si el movimiento se detiene, pero aca es donde comienza el problema en realidad, si activas esta opción, el sistema tiene una contra que la camara al desactivarse tarda 10 seg en volver a estar lista para registrar otra alerta lo cual hace que a veces pierdas información valiosa en cuanto a seguridad, si el movimiento para y luego se reactiva mientras la camara esta en el reposo de los 10seg, la camara no registrara nada en video y si el intruso sale fuera del rango de detección ya no podrás saber que paso luego, incluso si el movimiento llegar a seguir después de los 60seg max de grabación por alerta, la camara entraría en ese mismo tiempo de descanso de 10seg.

Aunque las alertas en la app son muy rápidas este Tiempo se puede ver afectado si la opción de alertas rápidas no esta activada, ya que esta viene desactivada por defecto y si no se activa en cada camara puedes tener unas que te avisen y otras que las notificaciones llegue siempre tarde o después que ya se detecto el movimiento.

En resumen si lo que quieres es un sistema de alerta de movimiento o cercanía este es el sistema que debería comprar pero si quieres un sistema de vigilancia de video busca otras opciones.

Dentro de amazon hay varias opciones de camara ptz wifi con grabación continua, detección de movimiento, alarma sonora y audio doble vía que trabaja muy similar a este sistema y con una memoria de 32gb tienes hasta 4 dias de grabación continua y son mas económicos, aunque no son tan excelentes como este en visión de video en vivo o revisando archivos de alarma te serán mas útiles si lo que buscas es un sistema cctv, por lo menos en mi opinión.

Postdata aun no se como funciona el sistema sin la membresía a Blink plus aun estoy dentro de la prueba gratis y aunque ya tengo todo el sistema para grabación local pronto volveré con mi opinión de como se porta el sistema una ves no tengas el soporte de Blink Plus.

--------------------------------------------------------

Let's start by saying that what the product offers is what you are going to get, no more, no less.

The product is completely wireless, giving you the advantage of a quick clean installation without wires at a glance.

The remote connection from the cell phone through the app is great and very fluid, when you want to watch the videos, although the connection with my echo show 5 device has been almost impossible for voice control and for live viewing it has a delay quite unpleasant.

The duration of the batteries is excellent, I have 5 cameras installed and one of them is at the entrance of the residential complex, which means that every day there are 70 average movement notifications with their respective videos and even after a month it says that it is over 70% life batteries.

Notifications are almost in real time, max about 10 to 15 seconds after motion detection, the notification arrives on the mobile app, but the connection with alexa in my case has been terrible and quite depressing because I decided on the right product for that function and I have not been able to solve the constant errors between alexa and the blink skill.

Now let's dig deeper into the technical and for which the system has disappointed me a bit.

This is not a video surveillance system, it is more in my opinion a motion alarm system with the ability to record the event that activated the alarm signal, although many times that video ends up frustrating you more and I will explain why below.

The system can only record between 5sec and 60sec of recording and although sometimes 60sec is a long time, it has an option that allows you to stop the video earlier if the movement stops, but this is where the problem really starts, if you activate this option, the system has a counter that when the camera is deactivated, it takes 10 seconds to be ready again to record another alert, which sometimes means that you lose valuable information regarding security, if the movement stops and then reactivates while the camera is At rest for 10 seconds, the camera will not record anything on video and if the intruder goes out of the detection range, you will no longer be able to know what happened next, even if the movement continues after the maximum 60 seconds of recording by alert, the camera would enter that same rest time of 10sec.

Although the alerts in the app are very fast, this Time can be affected if the quick alerts option is not activated, since it is deactivated by default and if it is not activated in each camera you can have some that notify you and others that Notifications always arrive late or after motion has already been detected.

No me In short, if what you want is a movement or proximity alert system, this is the system you should buy, but if you want a video surveillance system, look for other options.

Within amazon there are several wifi ptz camera options with continuous recording, motion detection, sound alarm and two-way audio and lights that works very similar to this system and with a 32gb memory you have up to 4 days of continuous recording and they are cheaper, although They are not as excellent as this one in viewing live video or reviewing alarm files. They will be more useful if you are looking for a cctv system, at least in my opinion. Postscript I still don't know how the system works without Blink plus membership I'm still in the free trial and although I already have the entire system for local recording I'll soon come back with my opinion on how the system behaves once you don't have Blink support Plus.",fair

We recently lost our internet connection due to updates our ISP had to make. What we didn't know is that Blink cameras are solely dependent on an Internet connection (not just a wifi connection) even if you don't have a subscription or just have the trial. None of the outdoor cameras will remain active when you lose Internet connectivity. My wrongful assumption was that ONLY your local area network was needed since it relies on a wifi signal. Nope. That is wrong. The Sync Modules will flash the green LED and no camera will work. Great job Blink/Amazon for putting customers at risk to thieves and other criminals.

We have 4 of the outdoor cameras on two separate Sync2 Modules due to the distance from the main router. We have an extender (set as a repeater) which handles the furthest cameras. As I said I never considered these would go offline if the Internet connection went down. I figured if my LAN went down then it would make total sense the cameras would go offline, yet I was foolish in my thinking.

Again this is shameful of Blink/Amazon to have this even as a feature. I get that you need an account to pay for the service, but why in the world would these be designed to FAIL if your Internet connection goes down?

It is not only misleading to consumers to not EXPLICITLY state that these cameras will fail to operate without an Internet connection.

This IS one of the WORST investments my family ever made in a product. Would have been better to purchase a CCTV camera system and just hardwired everything on the network. For what we've now paid for 4 cameras + the sales tax we could have gotten a 4 camera CCTV setup instead from a local box store.

As I have said in my original review, the cameras do work, and will suffice. Keep in mind that an Internet connection is REQUIRED and not just your local area network connection. I had to lower my rating to just one star because nothing is lower than that on Amazon's site. I'd give this camera system negative stars it it were possible just based on our experience over the past few months.

Also I think I was far too generous with parts of my original review, but experience will change your mind when the experience becomes bad.

I no will longer recommend ANY of the Blink cameras. Until they are no longer dependent on an Internet connection and will fully function on just your local networks wifi signal. I will be researching a true CCTV camera system to replace the Blink cameras. If I could get a refund I'd do it in a heartbeat, but that window has closed. The price of this education is high!

---------
Original review

Recently purchased the Blink Outdoor 2 Camera system, and it's a very hit or miss system. I have several things to say about the security cameras and the Blink app that goes with it.

The base:

The friction fit mounting bases are not easy to snap into place. I had to use a long and think flat headed screw driver to aid in connecting it. Also I worried about crushing the sensor on the camera because of how much force it takes and where my hands are pressing on the camera itself (holding from the edges while mounting under a roof eave is moderately annoying). Once it is finally snapped to the base it moves freely and the camera stays in place.

The Sync 2 Module

This is the brains of the system. Each module controls up to 10 cameras and utilizes your 2.4GHz Wifi connection. Now I mistakenly assumed that my 2 camera system didn't include the Sync 2 Module (I didn't notices a ""what's in the box"" on Blinks Amazon page. So I ended up buying one which was a waste of money considering it's included. The setup takes a while after you power it on you'll need the app to discover the device. Initially the blue LED flashes and the green LED is steady. Once it is discovered then then both LEDs are steady.

The app (Android)

At first the app to control this camera system seems simple, but there are some annoyances I've discovered. The system will NOT discover the best WiFi connection on your network. I have an detached garage with the camera approximately 75 feet from the Sync 2 Module, and my router is close to 10 feet from the Sync 2 Module. So I picked up a WiFi extender and set it as a Repeater (firewall, DNS, DHCP etc. is controlled by my primary router) in order for the signal strength to be at a maximum. It is recommended that you use the existing WiFi names (SSIDs) on your network (for 2.4GHz only) and append _EXT so Blink can see it if using a Wifi extender. Also keep your password keys for your wifi extender the exact same that are on your main wifi router. Now in theory (and based on Blink's own guidelines) the system should pick the best Wifi signal based on your setup. Well it doesn't, and there is NO option in the Blink app for me to place my garage camera on the extender Wifi (again it's on the same network as all my devices are) while keeping the door camera on the primary router (same network once again). This is not about changing networks, this is about discovering the extender on my main network (which I repeat Blink claims it will chose the best signal automatically). Yes I could add the second Sync 2 Module in the garage, but then I'd have to create a second system for the garage camera. Not entirely what you should have to do.

Batteries: These cameras require the more expensive Lithium AAs you do get the batteries with the cameras (mine were Energizer Lithium AAs. The cameras are equipped with a USB B mini connection which you can use to connect to a powered USB source as to not run off batteries. In my case I picked up a motion detector LED flood light that offers a USB connection (this unit https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08F9CNPVW). I would remove the batteries from the cameras because I do not know if connected will it try to charge the batteries (these are NON chargeable lithium batteries) or it will it bypass the batteries? I would err on the side of caution and remove them.

Local Storage (USB thumb drive) vs Blink Subscriptions

This is an Amazon product and you'd think that the Blink camera systems would provide free service to Amazon Prime members. Nope. You are nickled and dimed on a per camera basis at $6 monthly, and it's $100 annually (if I read it right) for one full system). Again why is this NOT part of Prime Membership?

So to avoid saving to the cloud I bought a 256GB thumb drive to insert into the Sync 2 Module. What I have discovered is ONLY clips are saved locally. You are NOT able to save live recordings to the local storage. Really? Why? What's the point of only having the clips (maxed at 60 seconds) on a local drive? To me this is a rip off and not mentioned anywhere in the product details.

Yes you do get a ""free"" trial which unlocks all features. If you; however, cancel that trial early or let it expire without buying a subscription than certain features are locked. So again you pay a lot for the camera system and you are locked out of many features IF you don't buy their subscription to the cloud. Talk about ripping folks off. Sure you can look at live feeds, but you can't same them locally. You can take a snapshot from the cameras, but it will NOT take a photo every hour UNLESS you BUY a Blink subscription. Again this all goes back to Blink subscriptions. Tell me what's the point of local storage if all you can save are clips?

Loading issues with clips and thumbnails. So I've run into issues where loading a clip from the connected USB drive fails to load 95% of the time. Again these are short clips and should pull faster than from the Cloud. Nope. Thumbnails are hit or miss. These are generated when you press the camera icon on the home screen of the app. I call them snaps, but I've noticed if I am sitting near the Sync 2 Module it can still fail. Full wifi bars too and it still fails.

Alexa:

It is claimed by Blink that the newest generation of their cameras will work with Alexa. I used the app from my phone, but she can't do anything with the cameras (even when trained to use them). In this case you may have to buy an Alexa enabled device (like Show). You technically don't need one they are NOT required for these cameras, but the Alexa app alone on a smartphone is limited.

Finally the recommend having minimum Internet speeds of 2Mb up and down for these cameras, but I believe that is ONLY if you are saving and storing to the cloud along with accessing from the cloud. Locally your access to the Blink cameras will depend on your network speeds along with wifi. The more stuff you have connected the slower it can be.

Conclusion. The Blink Camera System isn't terrible, and they are affordable. There are quirks as I mentioned and annoyances I have dealt with. These are not high end systems but on a tight budget you can get a good start.",negative
393,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor – wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera with two-year battery life and motion detection, set up in minutes – 5 camera kit",$249.99,1," FINAL UPDATE: What was once pretty cool and recommended is now completely useless. If you don't subscribe they take away features and the entire system no longer works right.. They want you to pay every month.. $10/month that's $120 a year.. They also want you to link your Amazon account. Make sure to read the fine print.. Blink wants your Amazon data.. I've spent over $2,000 on these cameras.. Now all of it is useless.. Short clips blurred images glitches all the time deleted clips reappear sometimes it doesn't even record no live view saves, sensors don't pick up anything audio goes out, it all turned to trash. They want to blame it on your wifi. 🙄 They are throttling controlling how well your cameras work.. I feel so betrayed and swindled. I've been recommending these cameras even set my parents up told friends now it's all a waste because Blink wants to be shady.. VERY DISAPPOINTING DO NOT REWARD COMPANIES LIKE THIS WITH YOUR MONEY. 👎🤨

UPDATE: 4/28/21 - 8 or so months in. I have purchased 17 of these cameras and 3 sync modules and planned on buying more also purchased many accessories. Different mounting brackets for the cameras and modules wifi extenders larger battery packs etc. They all worked great at first then slowly came the problems. I put up with the failed views the super short recordings that happened now n then the modules going offline repeatedly no its not my internet the glitches etc ... Now something about a PLUS PLAN suddenly pops up on my app. You can no longer save live clips. 😡 One of the cool things was being able to watch something live then being able to save it. You cannot do that simple little thing anymore.

The cloud storage wasn't that big of a deal since you could pop in a thumbdrive to save recordings. Now they want to charge you for the ability to save live views onto your thumbdrive. It was cool and convenient the ability to view something live catch something happening which is the whole point of a camera then saving it. Now if you catch something happening live its useless because you can't save it. 😡 The system has to be armed and you have to hope the sensors pick it up and even then it may not even reset. They ruined the playback on the app now. No thumbnails and if you want to delete you have to delete clips separately no select all option. This is NOT WORTH BUYING anymore. For the amount of money I spent I should be able to save a short live view. I could have purchased a nicer security system for the money I spent. I no longer recommend this system as they want to charge you a monthly fee for a simple feature a doorbell cam can do. At bare minimum they should not charge Prime Members a subscription fee. Very disappointing that they change the functionality so they can charge you for it. My original review and updates are below.
👇😕

This is pretty close to a must have they just need to make some tweaks. 🤙 Picture quality is pretty good. It has a nice dynamic range. The POV is pretty good. Its plenty wide and a little fisheye. For the most part pretty clear. 👍

The audio is fairly decent but you get a lot of humming and hissing. The microphone where you can talk to someone is fairly decent. You're talking about close distance about average distance of someone at your front door.

The setup is pretty easy just install the app and follow the instructions. Let it update the firmware. One tip when you get to the cameras leave the back off because you will have to scan the QR code.

So why not 5 stars since this is pretty cool? The back where you put the batteries screws on and off with a wonky tool they give you. It would be fine if it was a twist lock not an actual screw. The price is kinda steep. I needed 4 cameras. 4 sides to a house or building right? They don't have a 4 camera bundle. 3 or jump to 5. I purchased another single camera because it was only $10 more with a sync module than a add on camera.

Not much security for the camera itself. It just pops off. Anyone can steal it. The camera mount has a limited angle. Its basically made for a straight flat install. I bought separate swivel mounts so I can mount it to the underside of my roof on the side of my house and place the camera looking down the side of my house. They should upgrade the mount. You can always mount the camera higher to avoid theft but sometimes that's limited.

After awhile there's inconsistencies short clip recordings failed views no restart recordings after the pause and the longest you can record is 30 seconds and it won't fully record the full 30 secs. Audio cuts out or doesn't record at all and lots of freezes. 😐

This is a pretty good simple to set up and use camera system. The night vision and motion detection are pretty decent. They should have kept the free cloud storage but i prefer the separate thumbdrive storage. Less chances of hacking being all over the interweb. Using a thumbdrive is not a problem. Maybe they should include one. There's a slight delay in the live shot. Hear something and you wanna click live view you wait a few seconds and by that time the action is gone. They need to make that faster. As for getting notifications instantly when the motion detection is triggered its not bad but there's a delay there too. And it does not recognize or connect to my 5G only to 2.4G on my wifi. 😐 Like I said its pretty decent but could use some improvements and am sure they will continue to do so but for now for what I'm using it for as simple security and being able to monitor my house and yes I can be away and monitor my house from afar yeah definitely worth getting. 👍

UPDATE: Its been a month and a half and the batteries are still good. I do notice not as much hissing and screeching noise. Don't know if that means battery life is going down and the mic is less powered or what but everything still works pretty good. Picked up several of the mini cams as well on sale. Great for inside and the garage. Had one on the patio but it got a little moisture slime. Didn't affect the camera though but I did move it in.

Had one hick up. It said view failed or something like that once and I couldn't get a live view. I just took a photo and it seemed to clear that up. I see a lot of people showing that in the reviews so thought that would help.

I also see a lot of reviews posting pics of bad night vision. You need to reposition your camera. You either have something below it or above it too close to the lens. For example if you have it mounted under an awning and you get a dark picture or you get a foggy looking halo ring you need to bring the camera out further so there is not much covering the top or bottom. The sides are also affected but not as much.

Move it around remember camera position is key for good night vision. Even though it's made for the outdoors you don't want it in direct sunlight where the unit will go passed the 110deg limit. That will kill battery performance and camera capabilities. Hope that helps some of you with those issues. I will update again on battery life. So far its near Thanksgiving and batteries are good. I arm it at night 100% of the time. During the day a little less. I've captured several delivery personnel a raccoon a couple of cats sun glare off my pool some dust looking particles that look like spirits flying away 😄 and of course myself when I forget to disarm 😃 and the battery indicator says OK. They really need a percentage indicator on that. I live view several times a day but only for a few seconds if there's nothing going on.

The cloud thing is not a big deal at all. Get a thumbdrive and you're good to go. All your clips are saved on that instead of the cloud. I love the easy sharing too. I will text my friends with a short clip I can upload straight to my YouTube channel. Its pretty cool. One thing I would like to see is a shorter break between clips. You can miss a lot in 10 seconds. And a longer recording capability than 30sec especially with motion. I know that can eat battery life but they can improve there as well.🖖😉👍

UPDATE 2: I'm getting more failed to connect to cloud indications and I'm not using the cloud I'm using a thumbdrive. I'm also getting more false recordings. Nothing is happening and it will record a clip. Also a live view will pop up in the recorded clip segment. 🤔 Its starting to be a little fidgety but not to the point it upsets me.

UPDATE 3: One of the cameras needed a reset. Pop the batteries out then pop em back in. 🤔 It said failed view or not available something like that. Battery life is going on 3 months with moderate use. What's moderate use? I arm every night and 3 - 5 times a day. Take photos 2 - 3 times and watch live view 4 - 5 times a day. Each live view is for one cycle before it times out or asks to continue. Sometimes I'll watch live view for 3 - 4 times continued. Still haven't needed to replace batteries yet. 👍

Update 4: Colder weather is here and another camera needed a reset where you pop the batteries out wait 30secs and pop em back in. Battery still says ok and its going on 3 and a 1/2 months. It first gave me a failed to load warning here n there and that may be a sign you may need to do a reset.

Update 5: The inconsistencies have increased greatly. The syn module continually goes offline requiring a wifi reboot. The batteries are still good and it's been 6 months. There are more freezes and jumps in recordings.",negative
394,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor – wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera with two-year battery life and motion detection, set up in minutes – 5 camera kit",$249.99,4,"I must preface this review by telling all that I am a mechanical klutz but semi-tech savvy. I should also advise that I only received and assembled this product a few hours ago so I will certainly learn more as time passes and I will amend this review accordingly. Having said that, there are a few things that I should mention for the benefit of all other klutz's out there. The first thing I noticed is that there are no detailed instructions! Everyone noted in Amazon revewes how easy installation was so I wasn't all that concerned when placing my order. I should have been. Inexcusable that there were no instructions. I resorted to going to You Tube and found a couple of videos that were very helpful. But even with the videos, I had some very simple but troubling issues. I am after all a klutz.

The first step in installation is to download the Blink app. Much to my surprise, the free Blink app is not compatible with a desktop PC Windows computer. It is primarily an Android app so I was compelled to download the app to my Android phone. Now I realize that most would not have an issue doing that but I wish I had known that because I prefer to control my surveillance systems on my PC. I suspect there may be 3rd party companies that offer Blink compatible software for PC's but again, I wish I had known beforehand. I am still investigating and will likely find a solution to use the app on my PC but for now, can only use compatible devices.

The cameras and the module are all wrapped in a thin and almost invisible plastic wrap. One of the first steps is to install the provided 2 Lithium AA batteries in the rear of each of the cameras. I finally figured out how to get the back plate/cover off the camera and it was a little frustrating. First, you should know that there is a rubber plug that covers the screw which holds the back plate. You need to take that plug out to access the screw. The kit provided a plastic key that fits into the screw and can be used to unscrew the screw. Simple right? Well, I turned and turned and turned the screw but the back plate would not come off. I finally figured out that there was a very thin and invisible plastic that wrapped around the edges of the camera body and that it had to be removed because it otherwise prevented the back plate from releasing once it was unscrewed. Yes, you have to have had eagle eyes to have seen that plastic film and it was a little tricky getting it off. (I warned you that I was a klutz.) Ok, so now that I removed the plastic, I found a notch in the back plate to help lift it out of the camera body. That now revealed the slots where to install the batteries and the slots were adequately marked to show polarity positions. But after you install the batteries - do not screw the cover back on. Why? Because you need to access the camera ID serial numbers. Again, I had to find this out on my own because there were no instructions! Also know that once you do screw the back plate back on, it should be orientated properly and there is only one way that will happen even though the cover will go on any way. The easiest way to orient the plate correctly is to ensure that the USB C port opening lines up with the USB C port on the camera.

Synching the module and each of the cameras was relatively easy so I won't belabor these steps. The You Tube videos were very helpful to get through these steps. But here's another setup klutz problem I came across. To mount the cameras, there are mounting bases that attach to the back of the camera body by snapping into that area where the screw is located. Sounds easy enough but it is a little tricky. First, understand that the mounts need to be screwed into whatever house structure your attaching the camera to. But the holes in the mount are situated in such a manner that it is impossible to access the holes once the camera is attached. So you need to first screw the mount on to the wall before attaching the camera. The only problem with that is you now have to snap the camera on to the mount and as I mentioned above, that was a little difficult.

OK, now that I had the cameras set up, figuring out how to work the system was another stumbling block. Again - no guidance because no instructions. Even being a little tech savvy, I had some difficulty. I found that the software was not as user friendly as I would have expected. OK, I am still playing with the system and learning but once again, it sure would help having instructions.",positive
395,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor – wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera with two-year battery life and motion detection, set up in minutes – 5 camera kit",$249.99,5,"When we first purchased cams back in 2017, we compared to Arlo and Ring before we chose Blink. Now we are up to 10 cams, covering every angle of the house. Here are my findings after using them for almost 4 years (and still buying more):
PROS:
> #1 video quality is excellent. Day time is a bit better than night, but night vision is as good as it gets with cams. POSITION of your cam matters a ton. I started out putting them way high up and quickly realized - if you actually want identifying features - they need to be lower. Otherwise... yeah you see someone walking past, but you cant ID anything, so what is the use.
> So inexpensive - so easy to integrate. Anytime we have ANYTHING we need to cover, we just order another cam and it literally takes 5 minutes to get it out of the box, batteries in, and added to existing system.. seriously - 5 minutes.
> The app is great. Very intuitive. Our first cams had very few ""advanced features"" every time i order new cams, they have improved their features. Now you are able to zoom all the way in to very small areas, to capture certain areas and exclude others.. For example - old cams you had to block off large sections of the capture area to avoid the cams picking up movement from trees, but now you can pinpoint one little part of a branch on a tree to exclude if its triggering the cam.
> Motion detection is very sensitive - but they have it tweaked just about right. It never misses anything, but if you setup your exclusion zones well - you can get it almost perfect. I dont have a lot of false alarms and I'm running 10 cams. We have one setup to look at the sidewak, and after much tweaking, we can actually exclude the street... but pick up both sidewalks on both sides of the street. You can setup the app to alert you or not alert you.. you can turn sound on or off on alerts. On windy days I do end up just going into the app and turning off all cams that are setup around lots of trees until the storm is over.. but thats like a few times a year.
> Super easy playback and control of cams. It's instant - you can control them in any way, very easily. If I am working on a project in the yard, I dont want my cams on for hours, running out of batteries - so I just go into the app and turn them all off. It takes seconds. Likewise - if i hear a noise at night, super easy to open the app and live view any cam so i can look all around the house and see everything happening outside, from every angle.
> Extremely easy to move around. We have had them for years - so we move them around occasionally. I even had mice in our crawlspace under the house at one point and just grabbed one of the cams off the side of the house and stuck it down there so I could catch them at night. Theres no commitment with these - no hard wiring so you can mount them anywhere and taking them on and off the mount takes 2 seconds.
> No subscription needed to store clips. thats BIG for us. We would not like blink as much if they changed that. We run a lot of cams and it just stays 100% full storage - we can still access a few weeks worth of video, it just deletes oldest. You can download/save any videos.
> Lots of mounting options. You have to buy them separately if you want anything special, but I have 3 different types of mounts - one for trees, one around porches that need to be secured so they cant be taken, and then the standard mounts for cams not at risk of being taken. There are camo skins as well - I have on in a tree that you pretty much cant see unless you know its there.
> Customer support is super decent. In the winter of 2018, one of my cams took on a green hue to the image when the temp went down to about 10 degrees outside. I emailed customer service explaining the issue and sent a screenshot and within 24 hours they asked me for the SN of the cam, and did a firmware update that fixed it. I was quite happy with that.
CONS:
> So while the batteries are awesome because the cams are so easy to move around and deal with... i blow through batteries. Fortunately, i just get 20 packs of AA's, but with 10 cams - even though Blink ~says~ batteries can last a year? it totally depends on usage. So we get LOTS of traffic on our front cams because we live in a busy area and have people walking past all day. I change out the batteries on every one of those front cams once a month. Granted - thats many hundreds of video captures and ideally, we should connect those cams to electricity somehow - that is an option with blink, but I dont mind changing batteries. On the cams in the back yard and side paths - I really can go once or twice a year changing those, except for the ones that catch a lot of foot traffic. So the battery usage is totally dependent on traffic. Personally - the cams are a big deal to me, so i dont mind it at all. Benefits totally outweigh the downsides.
> The biggest difference between Blink and some other companies is that i see other people with hardwired cams that can catch EVERYTHING in a continuous fashion, for hours. like the surveillance videos you see online where the cam just happened to catch something happening down the street...Blink doesnt work that way. it only captures immediate video clips, triggered by motion activation. It does store all videos.. you can see something weird in your yard and look back through videos to find out what happened - but it isnt 24 hours of continuous video feed.
> You can get gaps in your videos. So it can capture 1 minute of video at a time, but then it takes a small break before it starts capturing again, so if something is happening and its videotaping an event - it will record an entire minute of excellent footage - but then it takes a 5 second break before it starts recording again. that doesnt sound like a long time, and for security it's not normally an issue.. the average bad guy is in and out quickly.. but it is annoying that it takes 5 seconds to re-trigger. So.... 2 minutes of continuous video... but in the middle of that 2 minutes.. a 5 second break.
OVERALL - Super high video quality... cams you can move around super easily... a very easy app... I love blink and the upsides far outweigh any downsides. I always recommend it to people when they ask. You can cover your entire house at a super affordable price, you dont need to be rich at all.. Our 3 year old cams are still as good as our brand new ones. The peace of mind the cams bring me is priceless. I know every single thing happening everywhere, all the time outside. The affordability made it possible so that nothing can ever surprise us.",positive
396,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor – wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera with two-year battery life and motion detection, set up in minutes – 5 camera kit",$249.99,5," We've got some bad actors in the hood, so it was time to catch them with some irrefutable evidence. Our XT2 is a little old and our Arlos are acting stupid. Saw this come out and had to give it a shot. It was time to upgrade. Plus, the specs of the possibility of TWO YEAR BATTERY LIFE is mindblowing. It's probably a lot less, but my Arlos would last a week with $10 CR123 batteries, so that had to go. Anything had to be better than those dinosaurs.

Set up was fairly easy. There is no real printed instruction manual, but those are rare today. Scanned the QR code and my smartphone popped me to their website with tons of tips, info, and even setup videos. The entire setup process is QR from the new Sync Module 2 to the camera itself. So don't make the mistake of slapping the batteries in and closing the camera unit like I did before I scanned the QR code. Whoops. Took less than 15 minutes to setup and sync. Signed up for a new Blink account so the old one won't get confused - plus there's several weeks of free cloud storage right now. Boom.

Set it up in a tree ACROSS from my house this time. When I put it over my door, my old cameras would flag every car or pedestrian close and far. All I want to see is the jerk stealing my UPS packages, so I flipped the perspective. The HD is super clean and clear, and the camera is at least 30 feet from the sync module with no problems connecting. Big plus there. And, there's a pretty powerful little speaker in this unit! I was really surprised at the volume this thing can push for such a small speaker. Now, when this alerts me to funny business, maybe I'll be able to yell at the perps. Probably not, because they'll be long gone by the time I see the notification. Still, this feature could be useful in warning your kids from doing something silly when you're not home.

The live view was disappointing, since you have to keep clicking the app to continue the live view for longer than 10-ish seconds. So you can't use this as a spying device or a baby monitor. Bummer. Also, the default recording time was like 5 seconds, probably to maximize battery life. You can't catch much in 5 seconds. I adjusted mine in the settings to about 20 seconds. I'll sacrifice battery life to catch a bad actor. Plus, there's a battery pack you can attach to this unit to increase battery life. I'll update in the future to let you know how the battery goes.

Overall, I'm impressed with the new Blink outdoor. It's gonna rain here in Florida soon, so I'll let you know how that goes as well as night shots when available.",positive
397,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor – wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera with two-year battery life and motion detection, set up in minutes – 5 camera kit",$249.99,5,"I was fortunate to buy in early on the Blink camera system. Therefore, I have the included cloud coverage. Only recently did I find out just what an advantage that was.

After buying my initial system, I continued to add cameras to the initial sync module. I ultimately ended up having two additional sync modules from systems I purchased after the original system. I was under the impression that all my cameras had to be connected to the original sync module to continue receiving free cloud coverage.

I currently have a mixture of cameras to include 3-XT2, 4-Outdoor, 1-Indoor (2nd gen) and 2-Mini. I was using a schedule to arm the cameras, but I was disappointed that the system would not allow individual scheduling for each camera.

I recently decided to use my additional sync modules to divide my cameras into different zones and allow myself to set different schedules for each zone. Even if it meant the additional modules would not include free cloud coverage, I felt the scheduling control would be worth it.

I was happily surprised to find that even the newer modules set up under the original system included free cloud coverage. Therefore, I now have three different zones that can be individually scheduled. And furthermore, I can add up to 10 cameras to each module.

I only ran into one problem with the setup. The second module I had purchased had been sitting in the box for probably about a year. When I tried to add a camera to it, it would not connect. I called customer support and the first person wasn’t able to help me. I decided to investigate the problem myself and noticed there was a huge difference in the firmware on the second module.

I expected that the firmware of the second module would automatically update, and there was no way to initiate an update within the App. Since it didn’t automatically update, I called customer service back and told them the problem. The individual I spoke with didn’t seem to understand the issue, so I simply insisted that the module’s firmware had to be updated by them.

It took a number of increments to finally update the firmware once the issue had been escalated to the appropriately skilled technician. I insisted that the customer service representative stay on the line until the firmware of the second module exactly matched that of the existing module. I wasn’t trying to go through another 30 minute hold and 20 minute update again.

After the firmware was updated, I was able to add cameras to the second module. I will monitor the module to make sure future firmware updates occur.

I realize that the cloud coverage or camera support may change or discontinue in the future. But for the time being, I’m quite happy with my Blink system.",positive
398,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor – wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera with two-year battery life and motion detection, set up in minutes – 5 camera kit",$249.99,3,"I've purchased a total of 4 Blink Outdoor + 3 Blink Mini cameras, plus a sync module and USB backup drive for the security system at my retail space. It's honestly probably the best and easiest way to get a security system installed without wires at a small business. Yes I have used Ring, and Canary. I prefer Blink. Since I’ve seen this now at brick and mortar retail locations, in addition to Amazon, I figure a review might help you make an informed purchase (spoiler, I love it).

This review really supports all of Blink’s camera products, as an ecosystem, though Amazon strangely would only let me review the standalone “Outdoor” camera. So you can infer details to the rest of Blink’s product lineup. You should know that Amazon purchased Blink in 2018, so I hope it gets some attention with new software features and hardware refresh.

Pros:
* Wireless. As long as you have reasonably good wifi, the cameras work. I use a mesh system to cover 6000+ sq ft of space, and all the cameras record and alert me.
* Battery. The outdoor cameras run on 2 AA lithium batteries. I don’t know how, but they last WAY longer than comparable rechargeable batteries for competing camera brands
* Price. Blink’s system is very price competitive. The mini cameras are downright cheap. The Outdoor cameras are competitive, considering how long the battery lasts, how small they are, how easy they are to install, and the superb reliability.
* Footage. Blink paid plan is cheap and stores a month of
* App. It’s simple and straightforward. Easy to view alert footage, and pull up recent footage. Wish it was easier to organize/review past footage… once you’re past a week it get tedious and hectic to find anything quickly and efficiently.
* Communication: You can speak into your phone with the app open and have a 2-way conversation with any party present at individual cameras. I’ve used this feature to communicate with staff, and also warn maleficent actors to leave the premises before I notify authorities.
* Sensitivity: You can customize a bunch of the toggles for camera recording, active area, sensitivity etc which is great. It’s not quite as intuitive as Ring or Canary which literally let you draw areas to avoid or record, but the toggles for the recording area as well as sensitivity triggers, recording length, quality, notification lights, etc are intuitive and great.

Cons:
* Multiple Locations: Currently Blink does not allow you to have multiple locations for your Blink system. This is a real bummer because I would easily buy this same system for my home, office, and to help keep an eye on my elderly parents at their house. Unfortunately you can’t. To do this you have to have a separate Blink account for each location, and manually log out and then log in to the location you want to pay attention to. That defeats the purpose of a security system, if you can’t receive timely notifications from all of your security cameras. If you have to manually review footage, it’s too late to help.
* User Access: Another big annoyance is you can’t selectively invite users to access your account with different access permissions. So currently I am the only person reviewing my Blink account. It would be a big help to delegate managers and other authorized administrators, especially in a multi-location environment where you want your family to have access to home security, your staff access to office security, but don’t want those groups to see the other cameras. I hope Blink implements robust user invitations and sharing access once Multiple Locations is supported.
* Geo-Fencing: There is no geolocated ability to arm, disarm, or set location-based trigger schedules for Blink. It’s either time, or manual arming or disarming. I also use a Canary system, and one of the big perks is the ability to have the system automatically switch gears if you or particular people come and go from a location. Wish I could do that for Blink, to have it automatically arm itself with the most sensitive settings when my staff leaves the location for the night.
* Auto-Delete: Once your USB drive is full, expect daily notifications that “local storage is full”. It asks you to delete footage to make room for more, which is pointless, because at the end of each day it will automatically do this (since the USB drive automatically clears old footage as needed, but still sends the annoying notification about storage being full).

Other:
* Neighbors App: Integrates with a community, I don’t use this much, but great feature to have especially for neighborhood safety.
* Amazon: You purchase your premium subscription through Amazon, and link your Amazon account to your Blink account.
* Alexa Integration: I use a series of Alexa devices with screens throughout the retail space to quickly look at cameras if I get an alert with my phone. Take a second to wake each camera (especially battery-operated Outdoor cams), and is very useful for safety and suspicious activity.
* Outdoor Mount: The outdoor cameras can be easily “popped” off their mount, if a maleficent person knows what’s up and decides to take a camera.
* Battery Life: The battery life of Blink Outdoor with 2 AA Lithium is good enough to not be a con. However the battery life is significantly less than “2 years” advertised. So far I’ve had to change the batteries on all four of my Outdoor cameras about every 3-4 months. Unfortunately there’s no alert or indicator to tell you if the battery is about to die. It’s either “OK” or the camera goes offline (with a slow blinking red light on the physical device).

VERDICT:

Blink is a great system, I totally recommend it as long as you only have one location and you are the sole user. The price is great, the performance is reliable with quality coverage, and it’s comparable, if not better than competitors.

If you need security systems at multiple residences or other locations, want to automate the system arming/triggers based on your geo-location, and need to invite and grant specific access to different people (friends vs staff) you should definitely avoid Blink and look to Canary or Ring for a security solution.

If the three major cons were address I would easily increase my rating from 3 to 5 stars. I hope Blink (and Amazon) is listening!",fair
399,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor – wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera with two-year battery life and motion detection, set up in minutes – 5 camera kit",$249.99,4,"I've only had these outdoor cameras for a few days, so I won't comment on battery life yet. But overall, I'm very happy with these cameras and most of their features. I'm nitpicking a bit here, which is why there are so many Cons. They are minor issues outweighed by the Pros.

PROS:
* Setup was relatively simple--once you understand it--but the instructions weren't (see below)
* Infrared is awesome in the darkest environments and does a good job switching between IR and non-IR automatically
* Motion detection works well, as does the 1-9 sensitivity setting, although this requires some tweaking until you find the right setting for each camera
* Daytime video quality is excellent and good enough to read stationary license plates up to about 50 feet.
* Audio quality is amazing! Individual birds and nearby bees can be heard easily, and normal volume conversations within about 20 feet can be understood.

CONS:
* The cameras seem to require an active Internet connection, not just a wifi connection (although I could be wrong). This may be because the initial setup requires you to use cloud storage. This could become a problem if your Internet connection is lost or dropped.
* Initial setup requires storage in the cloud (for the free trial), even if you install a USB drive in the sync module. I have not found a way to disable the cloud storage. This cloud storage requirement may be slowing down the entire system, since it forces everything to constantly use the Internet.
* Setup instructions were weird and unintuitive. The included booklet simply said to install the app. And the app is kind of confusing at first, and I ended up trying to create an account (and failing) and adding the sync module several times until I figured out what it was doing (and I'm an experienced techie). The basic problem is the app requires cameras to be installed only by following certain steps, with no other option.
* Setup requires the mobile app and an active internet connection to install the cameras.
* Accessing the cameras and video clips requires the mobile app. There are no desktop app or web options.
* Cannot schedule individual cameras. The weekly/hourly schedule can only be set for all cameras attached to a sync module. This is unfortunate and will make the scheduling feature useless for most people. It would also be helpful to be able to set quality, motion detection sensitivity, and IR settings on a schedule. The settings I use for night time would be different than the middle of the day or when I'm not at home.
* No quality setting on the audio. There are multiple settings for quality of the videos, to conserve batteries, but there's no way to turn down the audio quality, for battery conservation. The included audio quality is great, but it seems to be ""too"" high for the purpose of these cameras.
* Only 2 AA batteries in each camera. This could become very cumbersome to replace batteries if your camera is installed in a hard-to-reach location. The cameras SHOULD have 6, 8, or 10 batteries instead, so you don't have to replace them often. I would happily pay the extra battery cost so that I wouldn't have to climb up there very often.
* When a camera is ""in use"", its settings cannot be changed, and if you try to change the settings, you'll get an error message, causing the app's settings screen to get out of sync with the camera's actual settings, until you go back and modify the settings again.
* The ""Talk"" feature produces garbled, broken, delayed (by 3-5 seconds) audio that is unintelligible, no matter how close the camera and sync module are to your router. I have about 115 Mbps bandwidth, and it made no difference. You will never be able to use this to have a conversation of any type, even if they could understand what you're saying. This seems like a very odd flaw since the recorded audio is so excellent. This was obviously an oversight by the engineers.
* The Android app's setting to disable the vibration on notifications doesn't work. It always uses my phone's setting and ignores the app's setting.
* Insects near my 4 cameras are causing 15-30 false alerts per day right now, until I can figure out a better placement or setting. Other than the wear on the batteries, this is not a huge deal, but it can be annoying.
* The installation hardware is inadequate. Each camera comes with 2 large wood screws that are too big and too long for almost every installation. Much smaller wood screws and double-sided tape or Velcro would have been much more practical. I ended up not using any of the screws that came with the cameras because they were too big or impossible to use on the required surfaces.
* The back panels on the cameras are VERY weird to remove for battery installation. There are no instructions that I could find on how to do this, and the included plastic tools are not intuitive. I nearly broke one of the cameras trying to get the back panel off using the included tool. There's a certain trick to hooking and unhooking the tool from the back panel that you'll have to figure out on your own.
* The cameras and lenses are fully exposed to sunlight and weather, which is not ideal. The cameras should come with a small hood the lens or camera to protect it even more from weather and shade from light.
* User access cannot be customized. The only way to give someone access to a camera is to give them your password to your account and entire system. It would be helpful to be able to grant someone limited or temporary access, such as a neighbor, child, relative, or visitor.",positive

410,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Ring Video Doorbell Pro – Upgraded, with added security features and a sleek design (existing doorbell wiring required)",$169.99,4,"I have had my Ring Doorbell Pro for just under 2 weeks. Last week we were on vacation so I figured it was the perfect time to buy and test it out within the 30 day trial period. I’ll split this review into 3 bits. First impressions, Install, and Operational Use.

1) First Impressions. We have a security system installed but didn’t go with their camera system because it was CCTV and I wanted something with an internet connection or way to access it from my phone. While making small talk with the security system guy, I mentioned the Ring to him. He was super excited to get out his phone and show me that he has one. He said he couldn’t buy any camera with nearly that quality at that price even with his discounts. He spoke so highly of it I was sure that’s what I wanted to get. We want to do a whole system with cameras on the back of the house, but we purchased the Ring Pro to see how we liked it before we commit to buying everything.

I went with the Ring Pro over the Original Ring because I was going to be wiring it in place anyway. I also like the slender profile and the possibility to use wireless 5.0 in the future if I desire. Plus I live on a very busy road and wanted the advanced motion detection zones on the pro. Since I did my research, I was aware that the Ring Pro has a 160 degree field of view compared to the 180 degree view of the original. For this reason, I purchased fiberglass shims to angle it more towards my large 6 foot doors when I installed it.

I talked with Ring customer service and asked if there was any advantage to ordering through them versus Amazon and they said there were none, so I went with Amazon for my Prime shipping and additional protections of ordering through Amazon.

2) Install. I was a bit intimidated with the install as I’ve never wired anything up before and our house is new construction. But the YouTube video and pamphlets made it pretty clear to follow. They also emphasize that you can call them at any point for assistance. I had also been told by the security system guy that install was super easy and I could do it myself (he’s also the one who gave me the tip about the fiberglass shims). He also gave me an extra tidbit for those of us with stone or brick exteriors: drill into the grout lines – they drill easy; stone does not.

I started with the extra power pack that gets installed inside and connected to your door chime. It was the more complex part of the installation and involved a very tall ladder but it went well. I was impressed that the ring doorbell came with everything you need to install it – including the drill bit AND a screw driver. It even has extra bits you MIGHT need (like extensions wires and extra screws). I also really appreciated how everything was in separate baggies for which part of the install you were doing and was very well labeled (extras were labeled as extras, pro kit wires in one bag, doorbell wires and screws in another). I was unable to fit the power kit inside my chime housing but it doesn’t look bad attached to the wall just outside the chime housing (see picture). It’s just a bit larger than a matchbox.

Installing the actual ring was even easier. I was able to drill into grout lines between stones so I had that going for me. The hook up was super easy, two wires from the house connect to the two connectors on the Ring – doesn’t even matter which is which. Nice and easy. I will have to work out something to cover the shimmed side, but I’ll work something out.

Set up was easy and step-by-step. I was concerned when it was downloading the new firmware and updates and then rebooted because the light was off for (what felt like) a long time (maybe 5 minutes). But it all went flawlessly.

3) Operational Use. I like being able to set up polygons for the motion detection zones. I was able to easily mark my drive way, flowerbeds and porch. I’ve never had a problem with the busy traffic from the road (something the security guy mentioned was a problem with his original Ring). There are two problems they need to work out: You will get a motion detect when the night vision clicks on in the evening and when it clicks off in the morning. Expect that.

Also, this is not a miracle product. It will only work as well as your internet connection. That means a little lag if you’re on a cable connection at peak times. There are a few times I’ve had the video come up in laggy and weirdly pixilated forms that took a second to work out. I’ve also noticed our voice connection is VERY quiet. As in, the person at the door can barely hear the person on the phone, so I consider that feature a bit useless. We managed to scare our cat sitter from the other side of the country and greet my mom, but I wouldn’t rely on it for communicating with people often. We managed to talk to our lawn service but we had to yell into the phone and they had to ask us to repeat ourselves a few times. Also we live on such a busy road that there is a lot of noise which makes the video sound very choppy. So again, I just consider this feature a novelty and not something to rely on.

I mentioned a cat sitter. It was kind of awesome to be able to see that she came by every day. In fact, the first day she didn’t come by until 11:00pm and I worriedly texted her to see if she was going to come. Every other day I took solace in knowing that she had already stopped by without having to text her or fear her shed forget. I was able to see when the lawn service came by and did their thing. I was able to see when packages were delivered and when my mom brought the nephews up to use the pool. I also got to scare the crap out of our friend as they were leaving our empty house and I wished them goodnight. That was worth some money right there. I even caught a few people using my driveway to turn around.

My favorite bit was the unexpected bonus video of my husband going outside to inspect my work. I’m keeping that one.

It catches us leaving for work every day and coming home. It catches me when I go to fill the bird feeders. I’ve not had it miss any movement that I’m aware of. If you have motion sensors on, expect more notifications than you think you will get. As said, you’ll get the two from nightfall and sunrise. Plus I get two from me departing for work and my husband departing plus 2 more for each of us coming home. Add on more for checking the mail and anything you may do in the yard. This is where not being limited on storage size is handy. The cloud storage is $30 per year and it keeps videos for 6 months. It doesn’t say anything about size so having these extra videos doesn’t bother me. I find the video quality to be great and I can easily identify who is at the door night and day.

I also like that it came with a decal showing that the house is monitored. I placed this prominently in my front window along with our security monitoring service decal. Avoiding bad guys is worth more than catching them.

I feel like this was a great purchase. The price is excellent. I love being able to access it anytime from my phone. I love knowing what is going on at my house even when I’m on vacation. I love the security aspect both in surveillance and as a deterrent. It looks sharp (see photo). It’s also a lot of fun. I’ve shown it off to many friends and coworkers, at least one of which decided to get one themselves.

4) Summary. CONS: Only as good as your internet connection. Sunrise and sunset motion detects. Sound quality is useless in my experience. PROS: Access from anywhere, anytime. Surveillance and deterrent. Motion zones let you cut out areas you don’t care to monitor (neighbors yard, roads, ect). Great price.

As a camera only, I would give this 5+ stars, easy. I deducted 1 star because they heavily play up the speaker aspect and that seems worthless in my experience with it. I’m insanely happy with the purchase over all. In the future I will probably buy a chime and a stick-up cam to go along with it.

UPDATE: 1 Year-On. We have had the Ring Pro for One full year now. I've also added two of the chime accessories. I'm just as happy with it now as I was when I wrote this review. We tried to trouble shoot the sound a few times and still have had no luck with it. I think my unit might just be defective in that area. However I still think if this was advertised as a camera only, it would be 100% worth the price and 5 stars. I did have someone point out the sticker over the ring might be the cause of our sound problem, removing it didn't help.

Our indoor chime had the oddity of only ringing the first chime (rather than a series) after installation. As our indoor chime was never loud enough anyway, we added two of the chime plug in accessories without even trying to trouble shoot. We added one chime downstairs and one in our master bedroom. We've been super happy with them as well.

UPDATE: 3.5 years later. Still working. It stopped working for a while so I called customer service before I purchased a new one to make sure it wasn’t some power issue. They sent me (for free) the version 2.0 power kit and the chime bypass kit. Turned out the chime bypass kit fixed it. I didn’t need the indoor mechanical chime anyway as I have two Ring Chime devices. I used it this morning to tell the pest control guy the gate code without getting out of bed. It’s been up 4 summers now.

I still look at it every week to see what animals were creeping in my yard at night. Love the raccoons that come hang out on my porch some nights.

If this thing died tomorrow, I’d replace it with the exact same model, no regrets.",positive

Revisiting my review once again, making it 4 stars. My doorbell would randomly die after someone pressed it, rendering it useless until I reset the power. I decided to reach out to Ring and after a very brief conversation they offered to send me a replacement device right away. Once I received it, I quickly noticed that it was the same in the front but completely different hardware in the back. I swapped out the old (sent it back to Ring), installed and setup the new (very easy to do by yourself), and for the past month+ it has been working very well. None of the issues I had been experiencing with the original unit have since resurfaced with this new unit.

I'm glad I decided to reach out to Ring for support on this and was very appreciative of the support I incurred including the replacement device.

[JUNE 2018 UPDATE]
Well, my Ring Doorbell Pro died this week. It had gone offline about 3 months ago... then again about a month ago... and now it's completely dead. Previously I would go through the reset / setup procedure and it would come back online. Now there's no lights, etc. Apparently it's a ""known issue"" according to Ring. Read the numerous reviews here.

I understand electronics are not necessarily meant to last forever, but a $250 weather sealed doorbell that sits in a sheltered environment should last much longer than 2 years. In addition, the fact that Ring claims it's a ""known issue"" means that they are aware of a design flaw. The flaw could be hardware or software, but a flaw means it's their fault.

However, since they only provide a 1 year warranty, I suppose that makes it my fault.. Not a single person who's reviewed this issue and had any luck with support on this issue.

Support did call me back to advise me to disconnect and reconnect the ring pro to see if that would work. Others who have tried this indicate that it's just a matter of time before it will fail again though. I had to try 3 times before it properly reset.

I'm not going to hold my breath. Buyer beware - if you have money to burn, it's a fantastic device while it is working. I for one will do my research and see if there's a better alternative available while I wait to see if this one dies.

[ORIGINAL REVIEW]
One day while I was out running an errand my ring app on my phone notified me that someone was ringing the doorbell. I don't always answer, but decided to. The young man at my door seemed a bit 'off' and asked for ""Nick"". There's no one named Nick on my street... or in the small area where I live. I told him he had the wrong house and the guy left. Few minutes later I could not shake that something was off, so I reviewed the entire video footage - Ring captures motion so I was able to see what he did prior to ringing the doorbell. This guy was wearing a hoodie so he covered his hands, looked through my front door window for a good 5+ seconds, then started to check the door to see if perhaps it was open, before deciding to ring the doorbell... all with his hands covered. It was 70 degrees out. Once I answered, he seemed shocked and he quickly pulled up his hood.

I contacted the police and they filed a report. I shared my Ring video with them and they said it was the cleanest video they had seen in some time. Less than two weeks later a detective called me to let me know that the guy who came to my door was indeed looking to burglarize my home. He had been arrested and put in jail for other area burglaries. The detective said that had I not answered the doorbell, my home would most certainly have been broken into that day.

I've had the ring doorbell since September 2016 and this was the first and only time something odd/suspicious was captured and, to say the least, it works!!!

Now onto some of the issues I've had:
1. Ring initially was recording very poorly and sometimes would not capture video properly if at all. I installed a high end wifi extender nearby and problems went away. Previously my wifi signal strength was about 40% at the doorbell location. Now it's close to 100%.
2. My Ring doorbell went offline and it took me who knows how long to realize it. The app has a health monitor - RING why are you not telling me that you're offline??? Why do I need to discover it for myself???? Getting it back online was a bit of a hassle also.
3. Angle. I now see some angled plates for sale but would have liked to have had those when I installed it. It's perpendicular to my door, which means I am not capturing as much motion as I would like. Someone needs to be on my porch before it starts capturing motion. With an angled plate, I could catch them coming up my walkway instead, which is more useful.
4. Costs $30/year to maintain recordings. If I install additional devices, it's an additional $30 per device. Would have liked to get a price break.

Overall, great product. Not sure I've seen a better one on the market. As with any tech, there are always likely to be issues somewhere. Overall, I think this is a good product and well worth the peace of mind.",positive
412,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Ring Video Doorbell Pro – Upgraded, with added security features and a sleek design (existing doorbell wiring required)",$169.99,5,"I was looking for a replacement to my rusted doorbell and thought why not one of these more advanced video doorbells compared to the old, existing button doorbell.

Transformer:
I will talk about the transformer since there aren’t too many reviews based on it. The Ring website states, “Requires a 16-24 VAC transformer.” However, on the technical detail section on Amazon, it states, “Hardwired to existing doorbell systems (16-24 VAC, 30 VA) or powered by Ring Plug-In Adapter.” The Ring website did not specify the 30 vA requirement while the Amazon detail section did. This made me a bit hesitant on purchasing as my current existing doorbell has a transformer of 16 volts, 10 vA (not the 30 vA listed on Amazon). I contacted Ring via phone and chat and I was informed that 16 volts, 10 vA should be sufficient but I could only run one Video Doorbell Pro with that transformer since I didn’t have the recommended 16 volts, 30 vA transformer. I was advised to monitor it for a few weeks. I noticed that the voltage was decreasing from 3984 volts in the Ring app down to 3900 volts (3900 and above is the recommended voltage range). However, upon reaching 3900 volts (or 3898 volts the lowest), it would jump back up to 3980s to 3990s. In terms of functionality, there has been no problem regardless of the drop of voltage. Live views, recordings, motion detection, doorbell ring, etc. worked well throughout the day. I’ve had the device for more than a month now and I stopped worrying and looking at the voltage as it would drop but then increase back up and has been within normal range the entire time since purchase. I called Ring and was subsequently told that since everything is functioning well and has always been within the recommended voltage range, I was told that there is no need to replace the existing 16 volts, 10 vA transformer. If you are planning to install multiple video doorbells, I believe you should get the higher voltage/volt-amps transformer.

(Note: Finding your doorbell transformer may be a challenge, especially for older homes. You can look first behind the doorbell chime, in a nearby closet, attic, closet of water heater, or basement.)

Installation:
Installation was very easy. They provide all the tools required. You will need to turn off the circuit breaker for the existing doorbell and locate your doorbell chime and attach the Ring Power Kit to the existing doorbell chime. Then remove the two wires from the existing doorbell and place it on the Ring Doorbell pro. Just follow the prompts on the Ring app from beginning to end as it guides you throughout the installation process. For proper installation, see their instructions and/or even their video installation instructions on YouTube. I would contact Ring if there are problems as they are always ready to help but for me, there were no issues during the installation. Overall, it was a breeze installing it.

Videos and Recordings:
I have the other Ring cameras and cameras from different brand so this is not my primary video recorder in terms of recording everything. I wanted this primarily as replacement to my regular, doorbell button and to detect and record motions nearby. I set the motion zones to cover only the driveway up to the door. You can set up to three customizable motion zones, which is very helpful. You can also set the motion setting to “People Only Mode” if you don’t want too many notifications such as cars passing by. Like the other Ring cameras, there is a Motion Schedule option to alert you with motion alerts based on your schedule. It has a color night vision, tap camera preview for live view, and audio streaming/recording video setting options that you can toggle on or off.

An important thing to note is that it requires a $3 per month subscription or $30 a year. However, if you already have the $10/month or $100/year plan for the Ring Alarm, this is basically free as this plan includes professional monitoring, Ring Alarm cellular backup should someone lose electricity, and includes unlimited camera and doorbell cloud recordings.

Alerts and Notifications:
You get instant notification once a motion is detected or the doorbell is pressed. There are only a few occasions when there is a one second delay of notification when someone pressed the bell but I’m not sure whether it is due to my older phone but in terms of Alexa from Echo Dot or Echo Show announcing, it pretty much notifies me when motion is first detected or doorbell is pressed. For android, I love how you can customize the notification sounds per device. For instance, you can choose the one that rings like a doorbell followed by a voice saying, “Someone’s at your door” when someone presses the doorbell or “Motion detected at your front door” when a motion is detected via your Doorbell Pro. You can change for each Ring devices such the cameras. For iOS however, I couldn’t find a way to do this so hopefully Apple catches up in terms of customization.

Ring App
I know many people complain about the Ring app. For me, I love it. I love how you can see all your cameras in the dashboard and how it updates after a few seconds so you can quickly glance at your cameras when you are too busy to check out all the recordings. This for me is a game changing feature. I don’t like other brands whose images of the cameras in the dashboard is just a still photo from who knows when. There is also the Rapid Ring app the answers the doorbell and cameras or allows you to “live view” much faster than the regular app.

Echo Dot/Echo Show Integration:

I love how you can set routines such as Alexa announcing when motion is detected or the doorbell is pressed. This works both on the Echo Dot and Echo Show. You can also customize the light to turn on when the bell is pressed at a certain time frame that you have set. As stated earlier, Alexa notifies instantly as soon as activities occur, whether someone pressed the doorbell or a motion is detected.
My issue is with the Echo Show (in my case, Echo Show 5) where it takes a few seconds before the device shows you who is at the door/answers the doorbell. I wished it was instantly as the when Alexa announces it with the Echo Dot 3rd generation. It would also be a game changer if there was an option to show/answer the front door as soon as the doorbell is pressed. I believe this is a popular request. Perhaps Ring will make this possible in the future.

Integration with other Ring Devices:
I love how you can integrate the ring devices with each other. You can integrate this with the Ring Alarm so all your cameras will record should the Alarm goes into entry delay or when the alarm goes off. You can also integrate this with their lights such as the pathlights or even their motion sensor. You can also have the other cameras record when the Doorbell Pro detects motion. As mentioned above, you can integrate this with other lights that are non-Ring lights via Routines in the Alexa app.

Recent Activities:

I love how you can check the “Recent Activity” and see all the recent activities such as when the doorbell was pressed or missed so you can know when someone has rang your bell or what time a package was delivered assuming the delivery guy actually pressed the doorbell. It’s definitely helpful to know when someone has pressed the doorbell, such as visitors and guests.

Design/Look:
For me, this is the best looking doorbell. There are other doorbells out there that older people may not even think are doorbells since some don’t look like one with their ugly designs. Some also looks like plastic while this one looks class to me. This one for me has the best design. I also love how they give you different color Faceplates so you can choose from four different colors such as silver, black, etc. The ring circle is white and is lit up the whole time. When pressed, it changes to a rotating blue. You are also able to hear the doorbell sound from the outside when pressed.

Price:

I got this on sale with the Echo Show 5 so I got it a cheaper price but I do think the $250 is a little bit on the high side. However, I do think it’s worth the price and would probably by this compared to the other competitive brands. I like how I don’t have to bypass my existing doorbell chime as I prefer to have that ring as well. Other brands require you to bypass your existing doorbell chime so you cannot use it but I think they do provide a free chime of their own compared to Ring where you have to buy one if you need an additional chime in another part of your house.

Customer Service:
I have contacted Ring a lot regarding various devices, whether it is for troubleshooting/first time setup, product information, etc. I have to say that they remain courteous, professional, and helpful. However, some representatives would give different information compared to others. This might exist with other companies as well but I do wish everyone was on the same page in terms of knowledge. I feel that some are more knowledgeable than others. For the most part, they are helpful and are able to resolve all my issues. Ring on Tweeter is also very helpful. You can private message them and they respond pretty rapidly.

Overall:
Overall, I highly recommend this video doorbell. I am pretty much satisfied and happy with this doorbell addition to the home.",positive
413,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Ring Video Doorbell Pro – Upgraded, with added security features and a sleek design (existing doorbell wiring required)",$169.99,5,"4 YEAR REVIEW: My original Pro finally had an issue that they admitted could not be fixed. They offered me the latest model with a 30% discount. Ring said if I wasn't happy, I'd get a full refund. I took the offer because I had tried a different company and had more issues. This one did the trick. I get a live video within 3 seconds using the Ring Rapid app. The pictures are share with great color. I do wish I could make my voice louder at the camera. I've done everything I could with my phone but when it's noisy outside, it's a little difficult to understand me. Now I am satisfied and it's definitely worth the current price.
3 YEAR REVIEW: I've had the Ring Video Pro for over 3 years. This is absolutely the last update. The Creator of the Ring doorbell camera has diversified into different cameras and a security system. He also sold the company to Amazon. Throughout the time I had my camera, there have been many rough times. They have continuously tried to improve the system but it has not always been a smooth ride. The biggest flaw is still the time it takes to get a live connection from when it is motion triggered. The commercials show thugs trying to steal something from the house, but the owner scares them away by talking to them. That is more fantasy than fact. I can't even say ""Thank you"" to a delivery person. By the time the camera comes online, all I can do is watch the delivery person get into his truck and drive away. If someone tried to steal something from my stoop, they'd be long gone before I could say ""Boo"". I would have a great recording of the person stealing a package, but it couldn't do a thing to help me stop the crime. And I believe it's all because the signal goes through Ring's computers first before activating their app on my phone. It's done that way so they can charge you a monthly fee to save the videos. I have set up my own wireless IP cameras that I purchased from Amazon. I pay no monthly fees, I can save the videos on the camera or my phone and when they sense motion, I get a picture within a fraction of a second. Way ahead of the Ring. So after all this time I'm waiting for a doorbell camera that works like my other cameras; without the middleman. There is at least one that is close to being released as I write this. Not only will I save the monthly charge, but I'll have a doorbell camera that works like the Ring advertises in their commercial.
ONE YEAR REVIEW: I've now had the Ring Video Pro for over a year. I can honestly say that I am happy with my purchase. Ring is constantly improving the doorbell camera by upgrading it's software. The company is honorable and stands behind their products. Even with the initial problems I had, I highly recommend their doorbell cameras and would certainly buy it again.
FINAL UPDATE: I have been using the Ring Pro for about 6 months. After troubleshooting with my internet provider (they supply the router for my wifi network) my problems were due to my house's construction and my router. All my internal walls are sheetrock & cement with some having wire mesh. My network has many items on it and may get overloaded at times. It was suggested that I buy a better router that could handle the traffic at $350. So far that hasn't been possible. The Ring Pro works over 98% of the time. The doorbell button works, the live picture is crystal clear, the motion detection is constantly improving. The mobile app keeps improving too. That is a problem I can live with. The only issue I find difficult to live with is the time it takes from when the button is pushed, to when I can see who is at the door and talk to them and unlock the door. My workaround was to add a remote lockset that lets me ""Buzz"" people in. Technology is wonderful when it works and is a nightmare when it doesn't.

2nd UPDATE: I am sorry for the length of this review. I thought you would get the best picture if I left the previous writings. You can understand the six weeks and how & why my reviews changed.
I have been trying to get a Ring Doorbell Pro camera to work properly for over 6 weeks and 2 cameras. I have used email with level 1 techs. Email and phone sessions with level 2 techs, and finally level 3 techs. (Which you have to use a ""Neighbor Advocate"" as go between) I have always thought that the Ring techs were really nice and were trying their best. However, after stepping back and thinking about the events of the last few days, I wonder. How much time should it take to get a Doorbell camera to do what it claims. When do you say, ""This is taking way too much time."", and give up. The second camera, after 2 weeks of trying, deteriorated to being worthless. The push button stopped working, the manual ""Live View"" stopped working and motion detection worked 30% of the time. I wrote 4 emails in one morning pleading for help and saying ""Please answer ASAP ....Please."" and
""Sorry but this is a plea....Please help!"" Those got no replies. I finally got a response after the tone of my emails changed. No cursing, no threats, just,

""I hope you haven't gotten any of my recent emails and I hope you're not ill. But I feel deserted. I had sent at least 4 or 5 emails without receiving a reply. Lucky for me I can rely on myself. At least for now, I have my Ring Doorbell Pro button working along with ""Live View"".""
Then I got replies. Coincidence, you be the judge. When no one answered, I unplugged the camera for a few minutes and plugged it back in. Unbelievably, that fixed the button and ""Live View"", but not the motion sensor. I had asked in a previous email, if unplugging the camera could help, but they never answered. There are still issues. However, the doorbell button and the ""Live View"" video now work. When they stop working again but I can still fix them, I'll continue to use them. When I need customer support again, I'll get rid of the Ring Doorbell Pro camera and look elsewhere.

UPDATE: I just got off the phone with Timothy, a level 2 support rep. It was an excellent experience. He took his time, listened to everything I had to say and was respectful of my medical condition. He signed on to my laptop, which had the Ring app on it, and checked out my system. He felt the problems were due to my router settings. He made all the necessary changes to correct my problems. Since he couldn't stay connected all day, he checked what he could and gave me his personal email address. He wants me to check everything out and contact him on Monday to let him know how his changes did. He also gave me a year of cloud recording to make up for the difficulties I had. He apologized for the 3 weeks of problems I had. Unfortunately, I'm one of those people that picks up food from a drive thru and when I get home they forgot the fries. If it wasn't for bad luck, I'd have no luck at all. So the fact that I ""fell through the cracks"" didn't surprise me. I use a lot of technology due to my illness. I judge a company by their support and there are very few companies that pass my judgement. Ring passes with flying colors and I changed my review from 3 stars to 5. They are definitely a good company to deal with 95% of the time, and in today's day of overseas money saving support, Ring stands out as one of my favorites.

I purchased the Ring Pro to replace an aging wired system. I originally tried the doorbell camera from my alarm company,Vivint. That was way to slow, had only one way communication and full of glitches. I then got the Ring Pro. I decided on the Pro, instead of the standard for a few reasons. I wanted to use my 5 GHz network for the speed and the 1080 HD video for clarity. I originally had difficulty setting up the camera. I called support and they were great. First, I was told that I can't use the power pack because I didn't have a doorbell. So they sent out the proper cable with the ringer at no charge. When that didn't help, I spent about 45 minutes on the phone with a great support tech. I offered to pay to have a professional to set it up. The tech said I wasn't doing anything wrong and I should save my money. How often do you hear that from support? It wound up being a problem with my phone and not the camera. I used an older phone and setup worked fine. I have an HTC 10, so be aware. I do know others with the ""10"" that had no problems. I couldn't use the 5 GHz network because my walls were too thick which also caused sporadic connection problems. I finally purchased a Wifi extender and that solved my problems, for 2 days. As days went by, I started having more problems. The main one was sporadic live video pictures. Sometimes I would get a black screen instead of a live picture. Again, using Ring support by email, it took about a week to solve the problem. I had to move the extender around. Finally, it worked, for half a day. Now the problems became strange. The motion detection working sporadically, the black screen returned, the software crashed. We kept trying different things and nothing worked. I asked for a new camera, no deal. They are very much against sending a new camera. They finally upgraded my problem to level 2 support. That was 2 days ago. When I asked approximately how long it would be before they contacted me, I was told, ""We're not allowed to give out that information"". That's never good. One last item that I told them. I did not get the doorbell camera for convenience. I have a chronic pain condition that makes walking difficult and very painful. That's why I also have a remote door lock. Being without the ability to talk to some one at the front door is a hardship and each day that I wait for level 2 to contact me is painful.",positive
414,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Ring Video Doorbell Pro – Upgraded, with added security features and a sleek design (existing doorbell wiring required)",$169.99,4,"I have only had this for two days so far. I know it's short, but I came across a lot of problems already.

Equipment
I was pleasantly surprised that the Ring came with the installation kit. The screwdriver was of high quality! They gave extra screws, anchors, and even cable stuff. I love this type of packaging and thinking. Thank you, Ring, for thinking of those extra steps.

Installation
The installation is very easy. I have a mechanical doorbell and I already know where the transformer box is. I installed the power kit that came with the doorbell easily. Then came the Ring doorbell itself. Unfortunately, whoever did the stucco finish on the outside of my house sucks because the doorbell wall was not even at all. I couldn't just install the Ring doorbell--otherwise it would have been so simple. Since my surface was not flat, I had to purchase some stucco patch and even out the wall. After the stucco patch, I simply attached the two wires to my Ring doorbell and set it up with my Android phone.

Setup
Set up was easy as well. I don't have to do any manual port forwarding configuration changes on my router. I have two routers at home--one downstairs and one upstairs. My doorbell's location happens to get a stronger signal from my upstairs router so I connected it to that. Simple and done! Ring seemed to be working fine.

-- Problems --
Lag Time
Like some of the other reviewers have said, there is a 5 second delay to when my mechanical door bell actually makes a sound. That is so bad! I don't want my Amazon delivery people to wait at the door for 5 seconds! What if they leave with my package thinking no one is home?? Then you might think, what about my phone app? Well, the phone app has a lag of 2-3 seconds too. Besides, what if my phone isn't near me when I'm at home; this is when I need to rely on my mechanical doorbell sound...but the 5 second delay is really bad.

Mechanical Chime
Okay, I'm not sure which is worst: the 5 second delay or my original mechanical chime. My mechanical chime used to go ""ding-dong."" Now, it only goes ""dong""...where is my ""ding"" ?!?! What if my phone isn't near me, and I don't hear that ""dong"" ??? I don't know how to fix this issue. I have taken the doorbell off and did the rewiring again just to make sure the contact is there. When I took the Ring off, I took the two wires and made contact with each other only to find out that my mechanical doorbell chime is still okay (it makes the ""ding-dong"" sound even with the power kit installed), but somehow, when the Ring is installed again, the mechanical chime doesn't work as it's supposed to. If anyone has a solution, please let me know. I'm already missing my mechanical chime, and I fear that I might miss some visitors. It's only been my second day with Ring and the UPS man had to bang on the door loudly this morning just to get me to sign my package...

Network (1)
My upstairs router is connected to my Insteon Hub as well for my Insteon plugs and Insteon switches throughout the house. After connecting Ring to my upstairs router, my Insteon Hub stopped working. The light on my Insteon hub was still green and all my switches were working, but my Insteon app and the browser interface could not get the status of my lights and could not control my lights at all. After the first night, I switched the Ring's network to my downstairs network so my Insteon Hub can work again. Once I removed Ring from my upstairs router, my Insteon network worked again! I don't know why Ring and Insteon would have a problem when it's on the same router. I don't have time to figure it out, but after googling, I didn't see anyone else with that problem. I thought it might be some port issue, but I don't think Ring and Insteon uses the same ports.

Network (2)
After connecting Ring to my downstairs router, I left for work...only to find out that Ring had some issues. I always got a black screen on my phone when I'm trying to do a live view. I couldn't even hear any sound. When there was motion or someone at my doorbell, I would get the notification, but I see a black screen. On the Ring website, the videos that were recorded were either black or white. There were a few videos which had real picture and motion; however, only the first 3-4 seconds played the video and then the rest of the recorded video is just frozen. I read other reviews and did some search, then I figured that I'll try a WiFi extender for my downstairs router. I Amazon Now Prime'd a WiFi extender. When I got home from work, I set up the WiFi extender with a different SID (to make sure that Ring would connect to the extender and not the router), and then I set up my Ring again. Ta-da!! No more black screen!! It worked again. So the reviews I read were correct--Ring needs a very strong WiFi signal and connection.

-- Thoughts and Comments --
I'm lazy to return this, and I really like to monitor when my packages arrive so I'm keeping this doorbell (especially when there has been package thieves recently). I hope I can find a solution to the mechanical chime and the lag time. If anyone has suggestions, please let me know.

The subscription is stupid. It makes things very easy, but what if I don't want to pay $30 a year? What if that $30 subscription fee will increase in the future? Is the cloud safe? Where are my videos located? Where is the data center? Are they using AWS? (Sorry, getting a little geeky/IT right now, but security is always an issue). What if I get hacked?? I wish there was an option to save the video recording to my own local hard drive. Perhaps I should have researched other options. I was too excited and impatient when I saw the youtube videos for Ring so I immediately ordered it out of impulse. Others, please do your research on what's available out there first! Another doorbell I heard of while searching for solutions for my Ring problems was ""SkyBell HD"". Just Google! Good luck!

=============================================================================================
UPDATE -- DAY 3
=============================================================================================
I'm knocking 1 star off the 3 stars that I initially gave this product.

This morning at 9am, I found out that the Ring wasn't working because it didn't capture my family member leaving at 6am. I checked my phone app to see a live view. Unfortunately, the app is incapable of telling you whether the Ring doorbell is connected/powered on/powered off. This is an important feature that needs to be implemented. I had to go downstairs and physically check the Ring. I pressed the button, but nothing happened. The Ring lost power! Why? I have no idea.

I removed the face plate and tried pressing the setup button--nothing. I unscrewed the Ring and checked the wires. The wires were still intact. I took one wire off and probed it on the second wire/screw to make contact. My mechanical chime was working fine! I put the first wire back on, but the Ring did not turn on. I unscrewed both wires and then screwed them back on, and the Ring powered on again with my previous settings.

What??? Why did the Ring lose power anyway? Why did I have to remove both wires and screw them back on!? Do I have to do this every morning?? I guess we'll see.

So back to the feature I was talking about. They really need this feature. If your Ring doorbell is off, stolen, or disconnected from the internet, you have to figure it out on your own because when you try to do a live view from the app, it just shows a black screen. So how do you know if it's a power issue or an internet issue? They need something to detect this so you can troubleshoot the issue more easily. I should have been able to tell that it was power issue this morning and not internet.

=============================================================================================
UPDATE -- DAY 4
=============================================================================================
This morning, I found that the Ring has no power once again. The last activity I got was 10PM of the night before, but I did not see my family memeber leave at 5AM again. This means that the Ring lost power between 10PM and 5AM, and I still don't know why.

I disconnected one wire and reconnected it. By doing that, the Ring powered on to normal again. I don't want to do this every morning, and what if there is some suspicious activity between 10PM and 5AM?

I will have to contact a customer representative (thankfully, someone has commented with that info--thank you, Kandyce) and see what can be done to fix this. I will update later.

=============================================================================================
UPDATE -- 10/10/2016
=============================================================================================
My issue has been fixed. A customer representative (Kandyce) had commented on this review and offered help. I contacted her by email, and she immediately responded. She forwarded my issues and concerns to her technical team which called me.

I scheduled an ""appointment"" the next day for the team to call me in the morning. When the person called me, she restated the issues I had, and then asked me to do a couple of things. Here are the things she asked me to do:
* disconnect the power kit from the power kit from the door bell transformer and reconnect the original wires
* try to ring the Ring Pro

Somehow, she diagnosed that the transformer in my house isn't giving enough power to my Ring Pro so she said that she will send another power kit along with a Ring chime and that it should fix my issue.

When the new power kit and Ring chime arrived, I installed it and the Ring Pro worked perfectly. It didn't power off anymore. Unfortunately, I cannot use my mechanical chime anymore and will have to rely on the Ring Chime. I say ""unfortunately"" because I do like the traditional door bell sound and I am afraid to completely rely on the network and Wi-Fi; however, it is a cost of using Ring Pro. I prefer to have the Ring Pro as part of a security system so I have no other choice.

Since it took a week to two weeks to fix the issue, I did ask for an extension on the free cloud trial since I didn't really get to use it, and fortunately, Kandyce was able to do that.

I changed my review to 4 stars because of the superb customer service Ring has provided and especially since my Ring Pro is working fine now. Kandyce and her team were very patient and helpful when I'm asking for help. Kandyce even did a follow up to make sure everything is alright.

Good business, but the product could definitely make some improvements.

Some of the things I would like to see in future updates:
* ability to save videos in personal cloud storage (not using their service)
* ability to see if the Ring Doorbell or Ring Chime is offline/online (maybe network might be down)
* less black screen while doing a live view or answering a ring when I'm not home
* ability to change the chime on Ring Chime",positive
415,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Ring Video Doorbell Pro – Upgraded, with added security features and a sleek design (existing doorbell wiring required)",$169.99,5,"I debated whether the Ring Video Doorbell Pro really deserved 5-stars but in the end decided that it really met most of my expectations but still could be a lot better. The review is to let you know that you may face a challenging installation but may very well be like me, reasonably happy with the performance in the end. First, the camera is wide-angle, 100 degrees vertically, 160 degrees horizontally. That means unless your entryway is low with an overhang, e.g., on a roofed porch or in a low archway, the device may see a lot of the sky. Unless it's facing in a northerly direction, the sky may be very bright relative to the area of your front door at certain times of day, causing people close to the doorbell to sometimes be underexposed and extremely backlit. What Ring products really need is software that detects moving objects in the picture and optimizes exposure to the moving object, relatively ignoring bright parts of the background that are further away. Secondly, the claimed resolution may be HD 1080 for a non-moving object within a few feet of the fisheye lens in a well-lit situation. But more than a few feet away, if the subject is dimly lit or appreciably moving, the resolution is not so great and can be blurry, especially at night illuminated by the infrared beams in the device. Another general lament is the instructions for setting up the device take an Apple minimalist approach. There is very little detail and you are often referred to videos. Well, you just want to know one little thing and the videos are linear, each several minutes long, and must be watched from beginning to end. And which of many videos has the answer?! You can be left searching, searching the Ring web site for the right video. This conundrum could be solved by offering a complete, detailed manual on setup and operation to download for those whose installation problems are more complex. The PDF manuals that you can download are just PDF's of the minimalist ""guides"" that come with the product. Ring's approach to only serving up minimalist answers is to include in the product literature the offer to have a Pro come to your house and complete the installation for you for only $50. On installing, the first big hurdle you face is making sure that your doorbell transformer puts out the 16 to 24 v required by the Doorbell Pro. My transformer was so old that its faceplate labeling was impossible to read until I actually took it down but when mounted in its location, the 10 v transformer actually put out 14 v. No instructions on how to read AC transformer voltage or that free of load, a transformer can actually put out 4 v or more than its rating, etc. After you hunt around to find an authentic 16 v transformer (my Home Depot only had one rated at ""10 to 16 v""; a straight up 8, 16, or 24 v one was found at Lowes), you have to be sure that your doorbell chime will take the increased voltage or you'll be buying (and mounting) a new chime or using only the Ring Wi-Fi Chime. Installing the required supplementary Power Kit on your chime or using the extra wires and connectors provided to install the Doorbell at its location is predicated that there is space within the chime and space within the wall the doorbell is mounted on to accommodate the extra wiring. It took quite a bit of wire bending to get the Power Kit mounted inside the chime without interfering with the chime mechanism or having the cover fall off. The doorbell mount instructions say ""push the wires back into the hole in the wall."" There is NO SPACE in the wall. The doorbell cable must be rigidly mounted to a stud and occupies most of the space created by the hole penetrating the wall so if I had had to use the extra wires and connectors, I'd have had nowhere to put them. My classic doorbell button had a slight hollow recessed space behind it's plate that accommodated the protruding wires but the Ring Doorbell makes no such allowance. The mounting holes for the Doorbell Pro did not match the old holes on a BRICK wall. That meant drilling new holes with the supplied drill bit. Not so bad for the first hole but the second hole in a different brick took FOREVER either because the brick was baked harder or the supplied bit was failing after one hole. Perhaps Ring should supply a better drill bit or anyone facing a similar brick veneer mounting problem might want to pick up a better masonry drill bit for themselves. On Wi-Fi setup, I'd used both an Android phone and a Windows phone at the install location to check out Wi-Fi strength before purchase. With the Ookla speed test, I could get 22 Mbps download, 6 or 7 Mbps upload. Yet the first attempt at install of the Ring failed with a message ""unable to establish Wi-Fi connection"" and the suggestion to try moving my router closer or get a Wi-Fi extender. I accidentally terminated a second install attempt whereupon the voice in the Doorbell Pro that's active during setup announced, ""Wi-Fi connection established....."" Except for light exposure problems related to sky and low light situations and moving people, things have been excellent since the INSTALL triathlon.

The really good parts. Motion activation works great. In spite of the install warnings about network quality, within a second or two of a person entering the device's motion detection range, my Windows phone will get a notification of motion activation. Pressing the doorbell also similarly quickly activates my phone or the Ring Wi-Fi Chime but there is strangely a multi-second delay until the classic mechanical chime rings after a doorbell press. On a Windows phone (a Lumia 950 XL), it takes quite a few seconds to launch the Ring app, so if you're planning on quickly answering a doorbell press yourself, you might want to have the app loaded and just sitting in the background all the time. On a Surface Pro 2 computer, the Ring app launches in a flash after clicking on a notification but most of us are more likely to be close to a phone rather than a computer when the doorbell rings. So maybe Ring should have a really fast-launching applet just for answering the doorbell and talking rather than launching an app with the other 9 yards of setup and reconfiguration routines for all your Ring devices.

The customizable motion detection zones work pretty well, too. Wish there were more drawing points to determine the shape of included or excluded zones. Cars moving in excluded zones whose headlights shoot into active zones will trigger alerts. So will sunlight reflected off shiny objects moving in inactive zones. Flicking on bright interior lights within the house will also trigger the doorbell at night if you have windows opening onto the area(s) the doorbell camera is looking at.

But it's an eerie Jetsons' feeling to be walking through your house, your phone vibrates, you look towards the front door, and see the shadow of the UPS delivery person on the front door glass before they can even reach for the doorbell. And the Ring Chime has taken up residence in a remote part of the house from which we could never hear our old mechanical chime before. Great product after the install routine with hopes that someday they'll offer a version with a high-end drone-quality video cam (at an affordable price)! But during the day, the video close to the cam is very good. And since hardly anyone ever comes to our door at night except on Halloween, the just OK quality at night is easy to live with.

12/02/16 Update: Discovered that the RING Universal Windows app (works on Win10 phones, tablets, computers) is NOT as full-featured as the Android app (nor probably as the iOS version, too). With the Android RING app, you have a general sensitivity control over the customizable detection zones that's not offered in the Windows app, you can create rules to exclude motion detection by time of day and day of week, plus access to info on Wi-Fi signal strength to the device, device health, etc. Would be nice to see the same features available no matter whether using the iOS, Android, or Windows RING app.

12/07/16 Update: There is literally a night and day difference in motion detection sensitivity. During the day when set on max sensitivity, the device detects me walking up and down my driveway about 45-50 feet away. At night, the detection sensitivity seems to be limited by the infrared beam output by the device to a distance of 10-15 feet (in both cases I'm bundled up in thermally insulated clothing that probably hides my own infrared output quite a bit).

As others have noted the quality of the audio output isn't fantastic and seems to depend a lot on the device you're using. My wife on her iPhone 6 has no trouble understanding me and comes through the device's speaker pretty clearly. The audio didn't sound as good at either end when using my Windows Phone (Lumia 950 XL). Quite often in playing cloud-recorded video back using the Windows 10 app, the audio is not synchronized with the video but that may be the fault of the Win10 app or Ring's cloud service and not the device per se. The audio sensitivity of the microphone is pretty good and can pick up the plop of the newspaper thrown by the delivery person from his car landing 45 feet away on our driveway or a neighbor talking loudly with a handyman 60 or 70 feet away.",positive

But it turns out my expectations were way too high.
I was mesmerized by the commercials, captivated with visions of my gruff, electronically-brazened voice calling out over the speaker “Hey! Whutter you doin’ on my porch! Put that package down, the police are on their way!”
But it doesn’t work that way out here in Suburbia, not in the real world.
Oh, I tried, I really tried. I poured through the meek User Guide that came with the kit, graduated to the FAQs on the Ring website, and made so many calls to Ring Tech Support that I cringed each time in expectation that Ring would announce “You’re exceeded your limit!” But of course, they didn’t. They patiently answered my questions, helped me understand about 30-second versus 60-second video clips and the lag or buffering issue and zones and sensitivity. I learned about Device Health and Speed Test and download and upload speeds.
I moved my mailbox out of the way of the video doorbell. I bought a new porchlight that didn’t cast its ubiquitous glow onto the doorbell. I climbed into a 110-degre attic, swam through an ocean of blown-in insulation to find and replace a doorbell transformer. Because who among us has the tools or the skills to measure the output voltage of your doorbell wires? BTW, your local hardware store does not stock a doorbell transformer that matches the exact specs of the Ring Video Doorbell Pro, I had to order one online.
From a patient cable internet technician, I learned about updating the firmware on my wireless router (“You gotta do this 1, 2 times a year!”). But it was worth it, because now my download and upload speeds are in what Ring calls “the Good Range”. I also purchased and installed the Ring Chime Pro, even though my house is what I would call Small by today’s standards – under1,000 sq. ft.
But none of that helped. Even though when I go to Live View and can see all of my yard in vivid color (or stark black-and-white at night) and see every twig movement and hear far-away roosters crow, it still won’t detect and alert me to a person walking up my driveway, until they are actually standing on my porch directly in front of the camera. Oh, it will do it once in a while, maybe twice in a while, but it won’t do it every time, it won’t do it even a majority of the time. The only time it does it 100% is when the person is actually standing on my porch. I am confident that an intruder could roam my yard at will, do as they will to the cars in my driveway, as long as they don’t climb onto my porch. Well, I can go to Live View and watch every movement, but the Ring Video Doorbell Pro will NOT detect and alert me.
And that myth about me actually speaking to the person on the porch? Well, the ghost of that ship has done sailed, honey, far out into the sunset and ne’er to return. Only the Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Home Improvement Salesmen are willing to stay on my porch after they have rung the doorbell, waiting while it takes 10-15 seconds for the alert to hit my phone, and then the 2-5 minutes it takes for the video to become available for me to view. So no, my expectations were not met.
So, I will keep the new porch light, my wife likes it better than the old one. And I should have moved that mailbox long ago, it is much easier to empty in its new location. And I’ll keep the new doorbell transformer, it is a sturdy, handsome fellow even though it is buried beneath an AC return duct and 16 inches of powder insulation.
But my old doorbell is going back on my porch, and this Ring Video Doorbell Pro is going back to Amazon. It is too unreliable, and does not, can not, WILL NOT work as advertised.",negative
417,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Ring Video Doorbell Pro – Upgraded, with added security features and a sleek design (existing doorbell wiring required)",$169.99,5,"Ring Product Review – Nov 7, 2016
Summary:
After three months of use of the Ring products, I highly recommend them as a practical and cheaper solution to home security than the more expensive systems available today. I did have some issue with the products, but Ring customer support was more than helpful in successfully resolving my issues. When they could not help, they replaced or provided devices to me as stated in the review below. The only real recommendation I have before purchase is to ensure the user is somewhat technical such as being able to find the WiFi router password, knowing where the Wifi setting are on their mobile devices, and knowing how to install apps to be used when installing the Ring App.
I’ve found the Ring devices to be responsive regardless of my location on the planet. For example, I was on a long Australia trip where I had the same fast response to the Ring devices as compared to sitting in my home. The Cloud service and the overall design of the solution is well done, thus there are typically not delays in any of the capabilities.
I highly recommend the Ring solution for any home.
Products Review and Used:
• Ring Pro App (IOS version)
• Ring Pro Video Doorbell wired, not battery
• Ring Stick up Camera
• Ring Solar panel (to charge camera)
• Ring Chime
• TP-Link WA850 WiFi Extender
• Ring.com Customer Service
• Ring Cloud Storage
Ring Pro App (IOS version)
The Ring App (IOS version) is very well designed and easy to use. Most setup options or configurations have been designed well and meet 99% of the user’s needs. Ring has really thought of just about every possible configuration item you may need.
Recommendation: Install the app before attempting to install any Ring device.
Ring Pro Video doorbell (wired):
The RingPro video doorbell was easy to install per the instructions, but I do recommend having an electrician on call as the instructions to have the RingPro work with your home doorbell may be difficult for some people. I installed the wired version that used the preexisting doorbell power supply. This is the non-battery version, which I wanted as I didn’t want to watch the battery power. The setup of the RingPro to my wireless was very easy and as the review will show, setup of all devices is exactly the same.
Recommend: Having the WiFi router password handy before starting.
Ring Stick up Camera:
The Stick up Camera installed very easy, much easier than the Ring Pro as there were no wires to connect or preinstalled doorbells to work with. After fully charging the Camera (recommended as a battery device to be 100% charged), the installation as easy and complete in 5 minutes. Setup of the device on my network was very similar to my RingPro and configured easy on my IOS app at the same time. I installed two cameras and each time they installed just as easy.
Recommend: Charge the camera fully before installing.
Ring Solar Panel:
Since the Stickup Camera’s are battery operated, I highly recommend the Ring Solar panel to be installed in conjunction with the camera, otherwise you will have take the camera down every 3 to 6 months and charge it again. Installation was easy and setup was simply plugging the cord into the camera. The cord is extremely long that connects to the camera, which is good in some cases, but bad if they are mounted next to one another.
Recommend: obtain 3rd party (3M Products) to secure the wires to your home. These do not come with the product.
Ring Improvement: Provide plastic clips / accessories to connect the wire to the house or a way to shorten the cord that connects to the camera.
Ring Chime
The Ring Chime allows you to put the doorbell ringer anyplace in your home. The setup is exactly the same as the RingPro and Stick up Camera. Once connected, it appears in the app and is fully configurable. Even the sounds can be changed so you no longer use a ‘ding”, but dog barking and other sounds.
Recommendation : I recommend buying at least one of these to put where you do not hear your manual doorbell, for example back yard, deck, or garage.
Installation TP-Link WA850 WiFi Extender:
If during setup or operation you notice a significate delay in video or sound you could need a wireless extender to boost the WiFI signal. The TP-Link is an approved Ring 3rd party product and is an excellent extender in the event your Ring video lags due to being a great distance from your central internet ISP router/source. The configuration was very easy and takes about 3 minutes. As compared to 5 years ago when extenders where the size of a small computer, these are excellent as they look like a night light when plugged into the electric outlet. The cost is around $20US and will also boost the wireless on other devices in your home.
Ring Customer Service:
I’ve used Ring Customer Service several times during installations and troubleshooting some device errors over the 3 months I’ve owned the devices. I give them top marks for 1) answering the phone with a live person quickly, 2) providing a call back service so you are not on hold for long, and 3) very well educated and knowledge people that understand the product.
I’ve called customer support for 1) issues with my preinstalled/preexisting home doorbell, 2) one of my Stickup Camera’s had technical issues/battery issues, and 3) I lost WiFi connectivity on my RingPro doorbell. I will address each below, but need to state I’m 100% satisfied with the customer support from Ring.
1) Manual doorbell not working: Upon installing the RingPro doorbell, my preexisting doorbell would not ring upon pressing the RingPro button. Roger from tech support helped me greatly, but in the end, I could not use my home doorbell. In response, Ring then shipped a Ring Chime for free since their product more or less disabled my home doorbell. They said, although they have tested hundreds of doorbell models, there are still some they can’t support.
2) Camera Battery issues: Upon installing one of my Ring Stick up Camera’s, I could not get the setup to function. Ring had me depress the orange button the back for 60 sections (factory reset) and perform the setup again. It worked, thus I was able to install the camera, but I continued to have issues with this device. The battery only lasted two weeks, so I called Ring and they shipped me another one that arrived quickly and installed without any errors. So far, it has lasted more than 3 weeks without any issues or loss of battery power.
3) Reconnecting RingPro: About 3 months after installing my RingPro doorbell, I could not get the video to come up on my app. For some reason the device needed to be reset, which is only taking off the cover, depressing the button on the left for 20 seconds until it is in setup mode, and then waiting 30 seconds and pressing the button again. As with all technology, it needed to be reconnected to my WiFi again. This was quick and easy.
Ring Cloud Storege Service:
The Ring cloud storage service allows all video alerts, motion, and live views to be stored on the Cloud for up to 6 months. This is a crime deterrent as all video is stored off site and can’t be deleted without access to the user id and password on the app. The cost is $3 per month per device or $30 per device per year.
Ring Recommendation: I would like Ring to offer a home package for the Cloud services up to say 4 video devices instead of charging for each device.",positive
418,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Ring Video Doorbell Pro – Upgraded, with added security features and a sleek design (existing doorbell wiring required)",$169.99,4,"Ever since we got our candy cane Christmas decorations stolen a few years back I've wanted to get a camera by our front door. With so many options for cameras, I thought the best move was to get a video doorbell. I ended up purchasing the Ring Video Doorbell Pro. One of the main factors in choosing this option was that it used the wiring from my existing doorbell so I didn't need to worry about power and it connected to my home network without needing to be plugged into another box. The ability for it to connect with SmartThings was also a big factor. I was also able to get it on sale, saving myself about $50.

Installation

The installation was very easy. They provided the tools and clear instructions on what to do. The first step was to install the power kit to your doorbell box. It is only a couple of wires and then you are done.

The next step was to remove your existing doorbell and hook up the Ring. The kit even came with a drill bit and anchors if you need to go through cement or plaster. My home has siding and wood so all I needed to do was put in the screws to mount it. Again, very easy.

My main concern is with the placement of my Ring because of where my previous doorbell was placed. It is about 12"" from my door so the angle isn't what I had hoped for. The other problem was my siding, it is sloped so the bottom of the sided comes out more than the top which makes the Ring camera point upward. When looking through the camera I could see the side of someone's head while they stood at my door.

I decided to hack it a little bit by attaching some material on the back of the ring. I placed it on the top and on one side of the unit to angle the camera down and tilt it more towards the door. This helped but didn't completely fix the issue. Doing this made a big gap on the top and right side of the unit which I filled in with clear caulk. Luckily, it still looks okay. If you have this issue, Ring actually sells wedge kits that will angle the device downward or tilt it to one side. That would be another $19 so the DIY hack is good enough for me.

Mobile App

The next step in the process was connecting it to my network and setting up the app. This was also an easy process. It took you through the standard process of changing your wifi to the signal that the device sends out and then going back to the app to select your network and authenticating it to establish the connection. The rest of the process was giving the device a name and location and choosing what type of doorbell you have, mechanical, digital or none.

The location uses your home address and is used for their My Neighborhood service which is still in beta. This feature has some cool potential and hopefully it turns out good. It allows you to connect to a neighborhood and if others are using a Ring device you can share videos or alert others of any suspicious activity.

Overall. the app could use some improvements. The biggest announce was the constant banner telling me I need to sign up for the free month of video hosting. I couldn't get the banner to leave until I signed up, which I did. I am not a 100% convinced that I want to use their hosting. It stores up to 6 months of the video for you but for a DIYer like myself, I'd rather send those videos to another hosting service that I control. I realize it is their money maker but it also might be their downfall. It is $3.00 a month so it won't break the bank but it still is another hosting service I am paying for.

I really like the notifications from the device and how it allows me to quickly open up the live view. The rest of the app is functional. You can easily turn off the ring alerts and motion alerts. There are some prominent buttons on there that I won't be using and I wish they were out of the way, like the device health, partners, and linked chimes. Even the shared users don't need to always be there. These are things that you might want to set up once or see every-so-often but they need to be out of the way.

Motion zones

I love the idea behind the motion zones. I don't want to be notified every time the camera picks something up. My camera picks up houses across the street and a heavy used sidewalk in front of my house. Being able to set the motion zones enables me to be alerted only when someone has come to my door.

Unfortunately, the simple task of setting up the zones isn't as simple as you'd think. Because the zones I wanted to set up are at the bottom part of the camera I have to fight with the action bar that is there. You can tap the screen to hide the bar but when you go move one of the anchors the bar would reappear, making it hard to get the anchor to the position you want. Its actions are still doable but it gets a little frustrating having to keep tapping the screen for the bar to go away only to have it come back. This could be a quick win for the Ring product team to fix this issue. I have seen others complain about this issue and I'm convinced that if the Ring team watched their users go through this process, they would fix it. Hopefully in the next app update.

SmartThings integration

I am a big advocate for the SmartThings system and anything I buy for home automation needs to be able to connect to it or I won't even bother with it. The Ring does connect with it and allows you to use the motion sensor to trigger events but you can't utilize the camera within the SmartThings app. Not a big deal right now but would be nice to see. Of course, SmartThings keeps telling us that using a camera and capturing video from their service is a premium feature but we can use it free while in beta. This might be the reason that I look into another smart home system so hopefully, they figure that out that will benefit all of us and let us use our cameras.

Overall thoughts

1. I have been satisfied so far with what the Ring is capable of and I'm happy that I have purchased it. Of course, the price point is still too high and I wouldn't buy it unless it is on sale. Don't worry, if you watch Amazon, it seems to go on sale often.

2. Because of my existing wire location, the camera is set too high and doesn't give me the best angle. Also, with the slant of my siding, the camera is slightly pointed upward. I had to do a hack to get it working okay.

3. They force you into the monthly service option. Every time I got on the app I would see the annoying message to sign up before it's too late.

4. The motion zones aren't easy to set up. Because most of the motion zones that you'll set up will probably be at the bottom of the picture, you'll be fighting with action bar at the bottom of the screen.

5. My Neighborhood feature could be a great benefit. I'm really excited to see what this feature brings. There is only one other person using this in my area, it would be great to get more people using to really benefit from it. Now that I think about it, that is a great Marketing feature since I will probably start telling my neighbors about it.",positive

My original post is located below the original post line, this review is coming 1 year and 1 month after the original post.
My wife and I recently noticed that the ring app would freeze up when trying to use the microphone. After self troubleshooting and research online I finally made the dreaded call to customer technical support which is something that everyone dreads. Dialing the support number I braced myself for the never ending conversation with someone that is hard to understand and even harder to get to understand the issue so Imagine my surprise when the person I was directed to was not that at all. I am not sure if I should share his name so I will just call him Mr. K., Mr. K. slowly walked through the issue with me and indulged my interruptions of what I believed the issue could be and what my trouble shooting methodology was (I'm an IT by trade so I kinda nuked it, <--- Military people will get the reference lol). I gave him temporary access to my ring device as we slowly walked through the troubleshooting process one inch at a time. I will spare you the painful details (which to be honest I think he went as far as he did troubleshooting just to indulge me and my compulsion to over analyze everything to the smallest degree) before dropping the big bomb, my ring unit would have to be replaced and it was out of warranty. Of course my first thought was, of course it is and now I have to pay another $200+ dollars because this is what all these companies do, sell you something that is going to fail right after the warranty expires! So containing all my rage and indignation I asked how much it will cost hoping he would have a less costlier solution. His reply was simple, We appreciate our customers and would like to show our appreciation to you for being so patient during the T/S'ing process as well as being a loyal customer that we are going to replace your device at no cost to you. Immediately I found myself deflated and embarrassed for my unexpressed anger, but still still that feeling of suspicion hung over me so I politely asked if this would be a refurbished or new replacement, his answer was honest and straight forward. It depends on what is in stock. Sometimes refurbs are sent after going through the re certification process if they are in stock, and if not, then they will send out a new one. They do not have a set policy of replacing with either or as a priority. Well now I really felt like a jerk because I have finally come across that rare gem in customer service, the person that is there to actually help, takes pride in the company they work for and the products they sell. This interaction in itself (not the free replacement) was what made this company and product 5 out of 5 stars for me, even with the original issues still in play. I can be happy with this product even without the things I noted knowing that when I need help with the product, I can get it, and the person on the other side of the phone is patient, helpful, knowledgeable and willing to help. So to summarize, Ring is in my experience, one of the few companies willing to continue to provide great customer service by not farming it out to cheaper alternatives and having what in my case was a very knowledgeable and patient CS rep as well as a superior product (I am referring to the ring door bell since it is the only product that I have been able to purchase). Did it have an issue?... yes... was it a non functioning product?... No ... Most importantly, was I able to get the issue rectified at no cost... absolutely... Thank you Mr. K. and thank you ring for your exemplary Customer Service.

________________________________________Original Post_____________________________________________________________
I just received my Ring video doorbell pro and the installation was very simple and straight forward. The first thing I noticed was that the it took a little while after the installation was complete for the bell to start working. I am not sure if that is normal but if you do the install and the door bell does not work immediately you may want to wait 10 or 15 minutes before trouble shooting. I set up the motion senser zone and it worked as advertised, so far no false triggers but it has only been installed a few hours. The video is clean and very clear, the voice function works well unlike other users, the lag from sensor being triggered to app notification was about a second or two. The live view works and is a very convenient function. The IOS app works well and was very simple to use, the windows 10 app... no so much. The reason it gets a 4 star and not 5 is because of the following.

1. Windows 10 app is buggy, when I try to set up the detection zone distance it gives me the following error ""Arg_InvalidCastException""
2. Only six partners and none of them are smart home technologies I use. (this is of course my personal pet peeve and they may expand the partner list in the future)
3. The lens they use gives the live view and video a fish eye lens effect. I don't understand why they did not use a field flattener to get rid of the distortion.
4. Live View has a time limit. This is very confusing to me, I am not sure why I can not open the live view viewer and just let it stream the video to my computer when I am sitting in my office. One of the reasons I got this particular model was because of the live view, I thought I would be able to live stream to my computer when I am sitting in my home office so that I can watch for packages being delivered. USPS has a habit of dropping off packages and leaving without ringing the door bell, this has led to many packages being stolen from peoples porches and doorways.

Lastly, if you are like me and have multiple smart home products that you would like to tie in to your ring video doorbell (I have hue lights and wanted to set it up so that my porch light would come on when the motion sensor on the ring video doorbell sensed motion, this can only be done through IFTTT, needless to say, that is not a good solution since it takes 10 to 15 minutes before IFTTT polls for new action requests which means that if someone walks up to the door my light will probably not go on till they have either entered my home or left.) you will need to have wink products so if you are using Wi-Fi, ZigBee, or Z-Wave you are out of luck. If it is compatible with a hub such as smart things, wink, insteon or any of the others is a mystery to me and I have not been able to find anything online. All and all it seems to work well, with a few tweaks I think this thing can easily be a 5 out of 5. I will post a follow up after it has been installed for a while.",positive

I needed four cameras with floodlights, and a doorbell camera. Right before hitting submit, my husband's coworker friend told us to wait and look up the Blink system. I am VERY glad he stopped us. For one thing, this was at least $400+ dollars cheaper than Ring's bundle. I wasn't going to be able to grab a doorbell cam from Ring until later because adding one on was more than the budget I had. With Blink's pricetag, I could get the doorbell camera and still be saving $400+.

The coworker said they weren't very bright, bright enough for the camera to have somewhat of a night vision, but not enough to do what I wanted, which was shine a light on the area the camera is pointed at. Blink's lights are very obvious on the camera, and they're very bright without being ridiculously so. It helps me out a ton at night in my back yard to see my porch, my steps, and any toys my son decided to leave as traps in my path. Don't know why he does this seeing as how I use a cane and a wheelchair sometimes. Maybe he's trying to give me one of those obstacle course challenges! They are also very responsive.

The whole thing was so easy to set up and I love how they included multiple ways to attach the cameras to your home. I needed to use the siding clips for most of my house, but I did have to buy a hammer drill, masonry bits, and brick screws to mount one of the cameras to the front of my house that is all bricks. The app is really easy to use and allowed me to easily put my doorbell camera and my front camera on the same sync module, and then turn on only the doorbell camera as the front one still needed to be mounted. It also allowed me to block out the street in front of my house as my neighbors driving to their houses would set off the motion detection. Not a lot as I live on a short cul-de-sac, but still enough to be annoying. That was very easy to do with their zone option.

The camera quality is SO GOOD too. MUCH better than Ring's in my opinion. Especially at night. I looked at a video of a friend's night time Ring camera that detected motion and you could BARELY make out the form of a bunny hopping past. My camera picks up those bunnies and squirrels at night clear as day. It's really cool to be able to see the animals move around at night and they don't set off the camera unless they're on or immediately around my back deck.

All in all, I'd definitely recommend this camera system brand. You won't be disappointed!",positive

I purchased the device for my drive way and I noticed if someone comes to end of my driveway toward center of it, the device will NOT detect it as a motion and as result, it won't be captured.

440,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Pro with Bird’s Eye View and 3D Motion Detection, White",$199.99,5,"I installed this to take the place of a motion light and a separate security camera.

Installation: It was easy to install. I was very impressed that Ring includes various sizes of mounting screws as well as a tool tailor made for this item. I already had a couple of battery powered Ring cameras, and adding this to my account was a breeze.

Use: The lights and camera sensitivity functions separately. If the light comes on, that doesn't necessarily mean the camera comes on. I can make the camera much more sensitive to movement, but the light always seems to turn on way before the camera will activate. The camera range to what it will trigger on can be greatly manipulated but the light can only be set for movement a certain distance away. Once I realized the light and camera actually operate as two separate units, I understood what was going on. Until then it was frustrating - the light would pop on multiple times a night and the camera would not record anything until I set the ranges appropriately.

It will took a couple of days of fine tuning before I got it to the point where it was behaving the way I wanted it. And once I reached that point, it's been pretty much hands off since.

Wifi: The unit is located externally on a brick wall. The Wifi router is located so that the signal also has to go down this wall, from the inside to the outside. I initially set up an extender thinking that the signal having to go ""the long way"" down the wall would loose strength - and it does. But the extender wound up just slowing things down. In the end, the signal shows medium to low strength yet it behaves just fine. I removed the extender and haven't had to deal with it since.",positive

So I had an electrician install it for me. Once installed, I connected it to my wifi and the ring chime pro. For the first few weeks, things were going well. Then, one day it stopped recording events and I'm no longer able to view the live view feature. I called Ring's tech support, spoke with a very nice and professional young lady who attempted to help me to get things back up and running. After talking for a while, she said she would email me some instructions on getting things back up and running; which she did. The instructions I followed made the situation worst. I reached out to the young lady again via email and she replied and stated she wanted to continue to assist me. A day later I reached out to her again via email and never received a response back from her. I waited about two weeks before I reached out to tech support again. This time I got a different young lady, who like the first one was kind and professional. She did help me get my floodlight back online, but still no recording or live view was an available. Then for some strange reason she hung up and never called back--although she confirmed my telephone number in the event we were to get disconnected. This review can also be written for my ring doorbell which has the same problem as the ring floodlight. They both simultaneously decided to no longer function as intended. So for me the product is a waste of money if even the tech at Ring is unable to help. My money was wasted on this product and I wasted money on an electrician.

Update* I received an email from Brett, an employee at Ring,stating he would like to help me resolve my issues with my ring doorbell and floodlight. Today I had an appointment via phone call from Brett. He (Brett) took my wife and me through some trouble shooting steps to get my Ring products up and running properly.

450,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 1 camera kit",$74.99,4,"Due to my answer in the QA section receiving many endorsement, i decided to give it a bit more detailed review after 2 weeks into owning the Blink setup. I came from Simplisafe, and i still do have simplisafe's alarm system, but due to their lack of outdoor camera solution, i finally decided to pull the trigger on the latest Outdoor blink and try out the Mini blink as well.

First thing's first, the new Outdoor Blink cam works mostly as advertised but the indoor Blink Mini is junk. Read more about the Mini below. But first the Outdoor (good)

Blink Outdoor:
Motion recording speed & Delay:
The Outdoor cam's trigger time is almost instant, in fact, I noticed that it even records a second before entering the frame. which tells me that it might be doing some kind of constant recording into the cam's onboard volatile memory as cache, and once motion is triggered it starts encoding the data and dumps it onto the cloud. So the trigger time is almost instant. However, note that there is a 5 second delay from what's happening Live vs what you see on your phone. so that delay is between Trigger --> Encode --> Cloud --> Decode. I""d imagine that if your Cam is connected to a wifi bridge as oppose to directly to the main router, the delay could be longer than 5 seconds. Compare to Simplisafe cam, the Live vs View delay is about the same. and the trigger time is about the same too.

Motion sensor & sensor distance.
the motion sensor distance in the Outdoor cam is less than 25 ft. despite what the feature ad would tell you. i have 4 Cams (3 outdoor setup at an angle pointing down 45 degree angle, and 1 in the garage looking pretty much straight flat at my car), 3 of the outdoor ones could pretty much trigger 15~20ft out, while the one in the garage struggles to even trigger at 15 ft. You should also take night vision into account. in NV mode, the distance is 5ft shorter. increasing the IR blast in NV will somewhat mitigate the problem but at a cost of battery drain. i tried moving the cam in garage from pointing 45 degree down to looking almost straight horizontal to improve motion sensing to a degree. So if you have trouble with the motion sensor, try that. Compare to Simplisafe's cam, the Simplicam seems to have farther motion sensing distance. But then again, Simplisafe still doesn't have an outdoor solution.

Speaker/Mic
the speaker and Mic quality is really good. it doesn't sound overly tiny like you would expect and is loud and clear. compare to Simplicam, the Blink Outdoor has better sound and mic.

Wifi Wireless
i was surprised how well the wireless works. lots of complains in the review about wireless distance, not sure if they're genuine. but my farthest cam is about 80ft away from my main router thought a living room, a dining room and a garage and garage door (just shy of the max 100ft advertised in the spec), i am still able to get above 33% wifi N signal. But i think a lot of this ""might"" depend on the quality of your Wifi router. i spared no expense on my home wifi. So my router is 3x3 beam forming top of the line AC router that also has a very wide 802.11 N coverage. it can reach far and carry lots of bandwidth. my advice is invest in a quality wifi router with the most bandwidth and range you can afford. Note that the cams and module only supports 802.11 N. Compare to Simplicam, the wifi signal reach is about the same, if not slightly better than the Simplicam.

AC Wireless.
part of the charm and strength about the Blink Outdoor is its battery powered wireless nature. Only time will tell how long my Cams will last. I will update this review and reflect the score once my first set of battery run out. My gut tells me it'll be less than 2 years, well less. but i'd be happy if i can get even 1 year out of those cams. Note that the advertised 2 year battery life from Amazon is based on roughly 2 mins of video footage per day per cam. One of my busiest cam facing out the front door is seeing 2~3 times that amount.

Resolution/video quality
the resolution of the cam and video compression is really good. compare to those legacy 480p outdoor cams, this was a big step up. but compare to the simplicam, i would say the image looks slightly sharper than the Simplicam. but note that true 1080p resolution is only possible with high quality video record setting, which can chew up your battery and storage. Amazon's 2 year battery life is based on medium setting, which is actually 720p. but even at the medium setting, i still find the image to be very sharp and clear. going from medium to high (1080p) setting yield ""some"" improvement viewing on a smart phone. you likely won't be able to find big difference viewing it on a smartphone unless you view both videos on a large monitor. oh which btw, currently there's no app available for desktop computers. you'll have to either download the footage or pull the backup off your thumb drive to view it on a dekstop.

Storage
ok, this is the most contentious and messed up part. the ad made you believe that you don't need to subscribe to cloud and able to store locally. what they don't explain to you is that local storage is only a secondary option on top of the cloud subscription. so you CANNOT, at least at the point of this review, store your recordings directly to the USB thumb drive and read off of it directly. how the Blink cam works right now is everything gets dumped to their cloud server, and when you view the footage, it reads off their cloud server. the USB thumb drive is just there to backup ""from their cloud server"" ""once a day"". there is no way for you to have the cams upload recordings directly to the thumb drive locally and view them from your phone wirelessly off the USB Thumbdrive. There're a lot of people asking about this question on forums and, like me, only found this out after the fact. It's not a deal breaker, but it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Why not just come out and say it. It's simply misleading. if you go to their website, and dig, and i mean really dig, you'll find that there is a way to run it without subscription. but any motion trigger or live views will not be recorded. So what's the point of local storage? it's almost like they just want to find a way to cramp that ""local storage"" wording into their ad to sell you the product only to find out that it's a secondary backup on top of a pay subscription.

Now onto Blink mini (junk)

Blink mini on the other hand. To put it simply is junk or an opportunity wasted. the Blink Mini has a long standing bug that plagued the camera for at least 2 years, and the dev team still hasn't released a fix. The issue with Blink Mini is that it fails to trigger motion recording coming out of night vision mode when you enter the room to turn the lights on. the dev team explained that something to do with the cam goes into freeze mode when it attempts to wake itself out of night vision to do recording. for that reason, it's pretty much trash if you intend on using the Mini as any kind of indoor security cam. I originally intended to use the Mini in my garage to monitor my prized stallion. But i literately would go into my garage and walk up to the car and no motion or recording is triggered. Dev has acknowledged this issue since late 2018 and said in 2019 forum post that firmware update is coming to fix this. it is now end of 2020, i would not count on it. The only reason i kept my Mini and ordered another Outdoor cam for the garage is so that in any case when we go on vacation, i can set the Mini up in the living room to do live view. But if you're thinking about getting the Mini for motion triggered security cam indoor, forget it. don't say i didn't warn you.

Software UI/UX
the interface for the app is easy to use and more organized than many other similar services. clips are organized with usable filters at your disposal. the motion sensing manual dead zone configuration is helpful, although likely not too useful if you're using it outdoor, since the ""motion sensor"" distance (not wifi distance) is well shy of advertised 25ft.

OVERALL
the new Outdoor blink has a lot going for it. If they can fix their advertisement wording, or better, let us have the option to record directly to the USB Thumb drive and be able to view the recording from our devices directly from the thumbdrive. it'll then be a True local storage solution. the only reason i ditched my Simplicam is because i really wanted to have smart Cams covering my house outdoor. Been 3+ years since Simplisafe said that they would come out with an outdoor solution. But till this day, still nothing. i just got tired of waiting. When i saw the new Blink Outdoor being advertised for Black Friday, i really wanted to give it a try. i would say the barrier to entry is minimal. the Blink hardware given the discount that amazon has been giving out, is worth the shot. Without the deep discounts, i am not so sure. They just need to improve the motion sensor distance coverage, and let us really use the USB thumb drive for storage. In a sea of smart home security market today. Amazon really needs to do more to win over customers and not only that, to keep them there. If they can combine Ring with Blink, i might just ditch my Simplisafe completely and go Ring to combine their alarm system with Blink. If they can do that, i don't mind paying the $10/month subscription. But at its current state, they still have work to do to win over customers.

i will update the review on the battery life",positive
451,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 1 camera kit",$74.99,3,"Empecemos por decir que lo que ofrece el producto es lo que vas a obtener ni mas ni menos.

El producto es totalmente inalámbrico , lo que le da ventajas a la hora de una instalación limpia rápida y sin cables a simple vista.

La conexión vía remota desde el celular a través de app es genial y muy fluida, cuando quieres ver los videos, aunque la conexión con mi dispositivo echo show 5 a sido casi imposible para el control de voz y para la visión en vivo tiene un delay bastante desagradable.

La duración de las baterías es excelente tengo 5 camaras instaladas y una de ellas esta en la entrada del conjunto residencial, lo que hace que diariamente este por las 70 notificaciones de movimiento promedio con sus respectivos videos y aun después de un mes dice que esta sobre el 70% de vida.

Las notificaciones son casi que en tiempo real max unos 10 a 15 seg después de la detección de movimiento llega la notificación a la app de celular, pero la conexión con alexa en mi caso a sido terrible y bastante deprimente porque me decidí por el producto justo por esa función y no he podido darle solución a los errores constantes entre alexa y el skill de blink.

Ahora indaguemos mas en lo tecnico y por lo cual me ha decepcionado un poco el sistema.

Este no es un sistema de vigilancia de video es mas en mi opinión un sistema de alarma de movimiento con capacidad de grabar el evento que activo la señal de alarma, aunque muchas veces ese video termina por frustrarte mas y a continuación explico el porque

El sistema solo puede grabar entre 5 seg y 60 seg de grabación y aunque a veces 60seg es mucho tiempo, tiene una opción que permite parar el video antes si el movimiento se detiene, pero aca es donde comienza el problema en realidad, si activas esta opción, el sistema tiene una contra que la camara al desactivarse tarda 10 seg en volver a estar lista para registrar otra alerta lo cual hace que a veces pierdas información valiosa en cuanto a seguridad, si el movimiento para y luego se reactiva mientras la camara esta en el reposo de los 10seg, la camara no registrara nada en video y si el intruso sale fuera del rango de detección ya no podrás saber que paso luego, incluso si el movimiento llegar a seguir después de los 60seg max de grabación por alerta, la camara entraría en ese mismo tiempo de descanso de 10seg.

Aunque las alertas en la app son muy rápidas este Tiempo se puede ver afectado si la opción de alertas rápidas no esta activada, ya que esta viene desactivada por defecto y si no se activa en cada camara puedes tener unas que te avisen y otras que las notificaciones llegue siempre tarde o después que ya se detecto el movimiento.

En resumen si lo que quieres es un sistema de alerta de movimiento o cercanía este es el sistema que debería comprar pero si quieres un sistema de vigilancia de video busca otras opciones.

Dentro de amazon hay varias opciones de camara ptz wifi con grabación continua, detección de movimiento, alarma sonora y audio doble vía que trabaja muy similar a este sistema y con una memoria de 32gb tienes hasta 4 dias de grabación continua y son mas económicos, aunque no son tan excelentes como este en visión de video en vivo o revisando archivos de alarma te serán mas útiles si lo que buscas es un sistema cctv, por lo menos en mi opinión.

Postdata aun no se como funciona el sistema sin la membresía a Blink plus aun estoy dentro de la prueba gratis y aunque ya tengo todo el sistema para grabación local pronto volveré con mi opinión de como se porta el sistema una ves no tengas el soporte de Blink Plus.

--------------------------------------------------------

Let's start by saying that what the product offers is what you are going to get, no more, no less.

The product is completely wireless, giving you the advantage of a quick clean installation without wires at a glance.

The remote connection from the cell phone through the app is great and very fluid, when you want to watch the videos, although the connection with my echo show 5 device has been almost impossible for voice control and for live viewing it has a delay quite unpleasant.

The duration of the batteries is excellent, I have 5 cameras installed and one of them is at the entrance of the residential complex, which means that every day there are 70 average movement notifications with their respective videos and even after a month it says that it is over 70% life batteries.

Notifications are almost in real time, max about 10 to 15 seconds after motion detection, the notification arrives on the mobile app, but the connection with alexa in my case has been terrible and quite depressing because I decided on the right product for that function and I have not been able to solve the constant errors between alexa and the blink skill.

Now let's dig deeper into the technical and for which the system has disappointed me a bit.

This is not a video surveillance system, it is more in my opinion a motion alarm system with the ability to record the event that activated the alarm signal, although many times that video ends up frustrating you more and I will explain why below.

The system can only record between 5sec and 60sec of recording and although sometimes 60sec is a long time, it has an option that allows you to stop the video earlier if the movement stops, but this is where the problem really starts, if you activate this option, the system has a counter that when the camera is deactivated, it takes 10 seconds to be ready again to record another alert, which sometimes means that you lose valuable information regarding security, if the movement stops and then reactivates while the camera is At rest for 10 seconds, the camera will not record anything on video and if the intruder goes out of the detection range, you will no longer be able to know what happened next, even if the movement continues after the maximum 60 seconds of recording by alert, the camera would enter that same rest time of 10sec.

Although the alerts in the app are very fast, this Time can be affected if the quick alerts option is not activated, since it is deactivated by default and if it is not activated in each camera you can have some that notify you and others that Notifications always arrive late or after motion has already been detected.

No me In short, if what you want is a movement or proximity alert system, this is the system you should buy, but if you want a video surveillance system, look for other options.

Within amazon there are several wifi ptz camera options with continuous recording, motion detection, sound alarm and two-way audio and lights that works very similar to this system and with a 32gb memory you have up to 4 days of continuous recording and they are cheaper, although They are not as excellent as this one in viewing live video or reviewing alarm files. They will be more useful if you are looking for a cctv system, at least in my opinion. Postscript I still don't know how the system works without Blink plus membership I'm still in the free trial and although I already have the entire system for local recording I'll soon come back with my opinion on how the system behaves once you don't have Blink support Plus.",fair

We recently lost our internet connection due to updates our ISP had to make. What we didn't know is that Blink cameras are solely dependent on an Internet connection (not just a wifi connection) even if you don't have a subscription or just have the trial. None of the outdoor cameras will remain active when you lose Internet connectivity. My wrongful assumption was that ONLY your local area network was needed since it relies on a wifi signal. Nope. That is wrong. The Sync Modules will flash the green LED and no camera will work. Great job Blink/Amazon for putting customers at risk to thieves and other criminals.

We have 4 of the outdoor cameras on two separate Sync2 Modules due to the distance from the main router. We have an extender (set as a repeater) which handles the furthest cameras. As I said I never considered these would go offline if the Internet connection went down. I figured if my LAN went down then it would make total sense the cameras would go offline, yet I was foolish in my thinking.

Again this is shameful of Blink/Amazon to have this even as a feature. I get that you need an account to pay for the service, but why in the world would these be designed to FAIL if your Internet connection goes down?

It is not only misleading to consumers to not EXPLICITLY state that these cameras will fail to operate without an Internet connection.

This IS one of the WORST investments my family ever made in a product. Would have been better to purchase a CCTV camera system and just hardwired everything on the network. For what we've now paid for 4 cameras + the sales tax we could have gotten a 4 camera CCTV setup instead from a local box store.

As I have said in my original review, the cameras do work, and will suffice. Keep in mind that an Internet connection is REQUIRED and not just your local area network connection. I had to lower my rating to just one star because nothing is lower than that on Amazon's site. I'd give this camera system negative stars it it were possible just based on our experience over the past few months.

Also I think I was far too generous with parts of my original review, but experience will change your mind when the experience becomes bad.

I no will longer recommend ANY of the Blink cameras. Until they are no longer dependent on an Internet connection and will fully function on just your local networks wifi signal. I will be researching a true CCTV camera system to replace the Blink cameras. If I could get a refund I'd do it in a heartbeat, but that window has closed. The price of this education is high!

Original review

Recently purchased the Blink Outdoor 2 Camera system, and it's a very hit or miss system. I have several things to say about the security cameras and the Blink app that goes with it.

The base:

The friction fit mounting bases are not easy to snap into place. I had to use a long and think flat headed screw driver to aid in connecting it. Also I worried about crushing the sensor on the camera because of how much force it takes and where my hands are pressing on the camera itself (holding from the edges while mounting under a roof eave is moderately annoying). Once it is finally snapped to the base it moves freely and the camera stays in place.

The Sync 2 Module

This is the brains of the system. Each module controls up to 10 cameras and utilizes your 2.4GHz Wifi connection. Now I mistakenly assumed that my 2 camera system didn't include the Sync 2 Module (I didn't notices a ""what's in the box"" on Blinks Amazon page. So I ended up buying one which was a waste of money considering it's included. The setup takes a while after you power it on you'll need the app to discover the device. Initially the blue LED flashes and the green LED is steady. Once it is discovered then then both LEDs are steady.

The app (Android)

At first the app to control this camera system seems simple, but there are some annoyances I've discovered. The system will NOT discover the best WiFi connection on your network. I have an detached garage with the camera approximately 75 feet from the Sync 2 Module, and my router is close to 10 feet from the Sync 2 Module. So I picked up a WiFi extender and set it as a Repeater (firewall, DNS, DHCP etc. is controlled by my primary router) in order for the signal strength to be at a maximum. It is recommended that you use the existing WiFi names (SSIDs) on your network (for 2.4GHz only) and append _EXT so Blink can see it if using a Wifi extender. Also keep your password keys for your wifi extender the exact same that are on your main wifi router. Now in theory (and based on Blink's own guidelines) the system should pick the best Wifi signal based on your setup. Well it doesn't, and there is NO option in the Blink app for me to place my garage camera on the extender Wifi (again it's on the same network as all my devices are) while keeping the door camera on the primary router (same network once again). This is not about changing networks, this is about discovering the extender on my main network (which I repeat Blink claims it will chose the best signal automatically). Yes I could add the second Sync 2 Module in the garage, but then I'd have to create a second system for the garage camera. Not entirely what you should have to do.

Batteries: These cameras require the more expensive Lithium AAs you do get the batteries with the cameras (mine were Energizer Lithium AAs. The cameras are equipped with a USB B mini connection which you can use to connect to a powered USB source as to not run off batteries. In my case I picked up a motion detector LED flood light that offers a USB connection (this unit https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08F9CNPVW). I would remove the batteries from the cameras because I do not know if connected will it try to charge the batteries (these are NON chargeable lithium batteries) or it will it bypass the batteries? I would err on the side of caution and remove them.

Local Storage (USB thumb drive) vs Blink Subscriptions

This is an Amazon product and you'd think that the Blink camera systems would provide free service to Amazon Prime members. Nope. You are nickled and dimed on a per camera basis at $6 monthly, and it's $100 annually (if I read it right) for one full system). Again why is this NOT part of Prime Membership?

So to avoid saving to the cloud I bought a 256GB thumb drive to insert into the Sync 2 Module. What I have discovered is ONLY clips are saved locally. You are NOT able to save live recordings to the local storage. Really? Why? What's the point of only having the clips (maxed at 60 seconds) on a local drive? To me this is a rip off and not mentioned anywhere in the product details.

Yes you do get a ""free"" trial which unlocks all features. If you; however, cancel that trial early or let it expire without buying a subscription than certain features are locked. So again you pay a lot for the camera system and you are locked out of many features IF you don't buy their subscription to the cloud. Talk about ripping folks off. Sure you can look at live feeds, but you can't same them locally. You can take a snapshot from the cameras, but it will NOT take a photo every hour UNLESS you BUY a Blink subscription. Again this all goes back to Blink subscriptions. Tell me what's the point of local storage if all you can save are clips?

Loading issues with clips and thumbnails. So I've run into issues where loading a clip from the connected USB drive fails to load 95% of the time. Again these are short clips and should pull faster than from the Cloud. Nope. Thumbnails are hit or miss. These are generated when you press the camera icon on the home screen of the app. I call them snaps, but I've noticed if I am sitting near the Sync 2 Module it can still fail. Full wifi bars too and it still fails.

Alexa:

It is claimed by Blink that the newest generation of their cameras will work with Alexa. I used the app from my phone, but she can't do anything with the cameras (even when trained to use them). In this case you may have to buy an Alexa enabled device (like Show). You technically don't need one they are NOT required for these cameras, but the Alexa app alone on a smartphone is limited.

Finally the recommend having minimum Internet speeds of 2Mb up and down for these cameras, but I believe that is ONLY if you are saving and storing to the cloud along with accessing from the cloud. Locally your access to the Blink cameras will depend on your network speeds along with wifi. The more stuff you have connected the slower it can be.

Conclusion. The Blink Camera System isn't terrible, and they are affordable. There are quirks as I mentioned and annoyances I have dealt with. These are not high end systems but on a tight budget you can get a good start.",negative
453,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 1 camera kit",$74.99,1," FINAL UPDATE: What was once pretty cool and recommended is now completely useless. If you don't subscribe they take away features and the entire system no longer works right.. They want you to pay every month.. $10/month that's $120 a year.. They also want you to link your Amazon account. Make sure to read the fine print.. Blink wants your Amazon data.. I've spent over $2,000 on these cameras.. Now all of it is useless.. Short clips blurred images glitches all the time deleted clips reappear sometimes it doesn't even record no live view saves, sensors don't pick up anything audio goes out, it all turned to trash. They want to blame it on your wifi. 🙄 They are throttling controlling how well your cameras work.. I feel so betrayed and swindled. I've been recommending these cameras even set my parents up told friends now it's all a waste because Blink wants to be shady.. VERY DISAPPOINTING DO NOT REWARD COMPANIES LIKE THIS WITH YOUR MONEY. 👎🤨

UPDATE: 4/28/21 - 8 or so months in. I have purchased 17 of these cameras and 3 sync modules and planned on buying more also purchased many accessories. Different mounting brackets for the cameras and modules wifi extenders larger battery packs etc. They all worked great at first then slowly came the problems. I put up with the failed views the super short recordings that happened now n then the modules going offline repeatedly no its not my internet the glitches etc ... Now something about a PLUS PLAN suddenly pops up on my app. You can no longer save live clips. 😡 One of the cool things was being able to watch something live then being able to save it. You cannot do that simple little thing anymore.

The cloud storage wasn't that big of a deal since you could pop in a thumbdrive to save recordings. Now they want to charge you for the ability to save live views onto your thumbdrive. It was cool and convenient the ability to view something live catch something happening which is the whole point of a camera then saving it. Now if you catch something happening live its useless because you can't save it. 😡 The system has to be armed and you have to hope the sensors pick it up and even then it may not even reset. They ruined the playback on the app now. No thumbnails and if you want to delete you have to delete clips separately no select all option. This is NOT WORTH BUYING anymore. For the amount of money I spent I should be able to save a short live view. I could have purchased a nicer security system for the money I spent. I no longer recommend this system as they want to charge you a monthly fee for a simple feature a doorbell cam can do. At bare minimum they should not charge Prime Members a subscription fee. Very disappointing that they change the functionality so they can charge you for it. My original review and updates are below.
👇😕

This is pretty close to a must have they just need to make some tweaks. 🤙 Picture quality is pretty good. It has a nice dynamic range. The POV is pretty good. Its plenty wide and a little fisheye. For the most part pretty clear. 👍

The audio is fairly decent but you get a lot of humming and hissing. The microphone where you can talk to someone is fairly decent. You're talking about close distance about average distance of someone at your front door.

The setup is pretty easy just install the app and follow the instructions. Let it update the firmware. One tip when you get to the cameras leave the back off because you will have to scan the QR code.

So why not 5 stars since this is pretty cool? The back where you put the batteries screws on and off with a wonky tool they give you. It would be fine if it was a twist lock not an actual screw. The price is kinda steep. I needed 4 cameras. 4 sides to a house or building right? They don't have a 4 camera bundle. 3 or jump to 5. I purchased another single camera because it was only $10 more with a sync module than a add on camera.

Not much security for the camera itself. It just pops off. Anyone can steal it. The camera mount has a limited angle. Its basically made for a straight flat install. I bought separate swivel mounts so I can mount it to the underside of my roof on the side of my house and place the camera looking down the side of my house. They should upgrade the mount. You can always mount the camera higher to avoid theft but sometimes that's limited.

After awhile there's inconsistencies short clip recordings failed views no restart recordings after the pause and the longest you can record is 30 seconds and it won't fully record the full 30 secs. Audio cuts out or doesn't record at all and lots of freezes. 😐

This is a pretty good simple to set up and use camera system. The night vision and motion detection are pretty decent. They should have kept the free cloud storage but i prefer the separate thumbdrive storage. Less chances of hacking being all over the interweb. Using a thumbdrive is not a problem. Maybe they should include one. There's a slight delay in the live shot. Hear something and you wanna click live view you wait a few seconds and by that time the action is gone. They need to make that faster. As for getting notifications instantly when the motion detection is triggered its not bad but there's a delay there too. And it does not recognize or connect to my 5G only to 2.4G on my wifi. 😐 Like I said its pretty decent but could use some improvements and am sure they will continue to do so but for now for what I'm using it for as simple security and being able to monitor my house and yes I can be away and monitor my house from afar yeah definitely worth getting. 👍

UPDATE: Its been a month and a half and the batteries are still good. I do notice not as much hissing and screeching noise. Don't know if that means battery life is going down and the mic is less powered or what but everything still works pretty good. Picked up several of the mini cams as well on sale. Great for inside and the garage. Had one on the patio but it got a little moisture slime. Didn't affect the camera though but I did move it in.

Had one hick up. It said view failed or something like that once and I couldn't get a live view. I just took a photo and it seemed to clear that up. I see a lot of people showing that in the reviews so thought that would help.

I also see a lot of reviews posting pics of bad night vision. You need to reposition your camera. You either have something below it or above it too close to the lens. For example if you have it mounted under an awning and you get a dark picture or you get a foggy looking halo ring you need to bring the camera out further so there is not much covering the top or bottom. The sides are also affected but not as much.

Move it around remember camera position is key for good night vision. Even though it's made for the outdoors you don't want it in direct sunlight where the unit will go passed the 110deg limit. That will kill battery performance and camera capabilities. Hope that helps some of you with those issues. I will update again on battery life. So far its near Thanksgiving and batteries are good. I arm it at night 100% of the time. During the day a little less. I've captured several delivery personnel a raccoon a couple of cats sun glare off my pool some dust looking particles that look like spirits flying away 😄 and of course myself when I forget to disarm 😃 and the battery indicator says OK. They really need a percentage indicator on that. I live view several times a day but only for a few seconds if there's nothing going on.

The cloud thing is not a big deal at all. Get a thumbdrive and you're good to go. All your clips are saved on that instead of the cloud. I love the easy sharing too. I will text my friends with a short clip I can upload straight to my YouTube channel. Its pretty cool. One thing I would like to see is a shorter break between clips. You can miss a lot in 10 seconds. And a longer recording capability than 30sec especially with motion. I know that can eat battery life but they can improve there as well.🖖😉👍

UPDATE 2: I'm getting more failed to connect to cloud indications and I'm not using the cloud I'm using a thumbdrive. I'm also getting more false recordings. Nothing is happening and it will record a clip. Also a live view will pop up in the recorded clip segment. 🤔 Its starting to be a little fidgety but not to the point it upsets me.

UPDATE 3: One of the cameras needed a reset. Pop the batteries out then pop em back in. 🤔 It said failed view or not available something like that. Battery life is going on 3 months with moderate use. What's moderate use? I arm every night and 3 - 5 times a day. Take photos 2 - 3 times and watch live view 4 - 5 times a day. Each live view is for one cycle before it times out or asks to continue. Sometimes I'll watch live view for 3 - 4 times continued. Still haven't needed to replace batteries yet. 👍

Update 4: Colder weather is here and another camera needed a reset where you pop the batteries out wait 30secs and pop em back in. Battery still says ok and its going on 3 and a 1/2 months. It first gave me a failed to load warning here n there and that may be a sign you may need to do a reset.

Update 5: The inconsistencies have increased greatly. The syn module continually goes offline requiring a wifi reboot. The batteries are still good and it's been 6 months. There are more freezes and jumps in recordings.",negative
454,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 1 camera kit",$74.99,4,"I must preface this review by telling all that I am a mechanical klutz but semi-tech savvy. I should also advise that I only received and assembled this product a few hours ago so I will certainly learn more as time passes and I will amend this review accordingly. Having said that, there are a few things that I should mention for the benefit of all other klutz's out there. The first thing I noticed is that there are no detailed instructions! Everyone noted in Amazon revewes how easy installation was so I wasn't all that concerned when placing my order. I should have been. Inexcusable that there were no instructions. I resorted to going to You Tube and found a couple of videos that were very helpful. But even with the videos, I had some very simple but troubling issues. I am after all a klutz.

The first step in installation is to download the Blink app. Much to my surprise, the free Blink app is not compatible with a desktop PC Windows computer. It is primarily an Android app so I was compelled to download the app to my Android phone. Now I realize that most would not have an issue doing that but I wish I had known that because I prefer to control my surveillance systems on my PC. I suspect there may be 3rd party companies that offer Blink compatible software for PC's but again, I wish I had known beforehand. I am still investigating and will likely find a solution to use the app on my PC but for now, can only use compatible devices.

The cameras and the module are all wrapped in a thin and almost invisible plastic wrap. One of the first steps is to install the provided 2 Lithium AA batteries in the rear of each of the cameras. I finally figured out how to get the back plate/cover off the camera and it was a little frustrating. First, you should know that there is a rubber plug that covers the screw which holds the back plate. You need to take that plug out to access the screw. The kit provided a plastic key that fits into the screw and can be used to unscrew the screw. Simple right? Well, I turned and turned and turned the screw but the back plate would not come off. I finally figured out that there was a very thin and invisible plastic that wrapped around the edges of the camera body and that it had to be removed because it otherwise prevented the back plate from releasing once it was unscrewed. Yes, you have to have had eagle eyes to have seen that plastic film and it was a little tricky getting it off. (I warned you that I was a klutz.) Ok, so now that I removed the plastic, I found a notch in the back plate to help lift it out of the camera body. That now revealed the slots where to install the batteries and the slots were adequately marked to show polarity positions. But after you install the batteries - do not screw the cover back on. Why? Because you need to access the camera ID serial numbers. Again, I had to find this out on my own because there were no instructions! Also know that once you do screw the back plate back on, it should be orientated properly and there is only one way that will happen even though the cover will go on any way. The easiest way to orient the plate correctly is to ensure that the USB C port opening lines up with the USB C port on the camera.

Synching the module and each of the cameras was relatively easy so I won't belabor these steps. The You Tube videos were very helpful to get through these steps. But here's another setup klutz problem I came across. To mount the cameras, there are mounting bases that attach to the back of the camera body by snapping into that area where the screw is located. Sounds easy enough but it is a little tricky. First, understand that the mounts need to be screwed into whatever house structure your attaching the camera to. But the holes in the mount are situated in such a manner that it is impossible to access the holes once the camera is attached. So you need to first screw the mount on to the wall before attaching the camera. The only problem with that is you now have to snap the camera on to the mount and as I mentioned above, that was a little difficult.

OK, now that I had the cameras set up, figuring out how to work the system was another stumbling block. Again - no guidance because no instructions. Even being a little tech savvy, I had some difficulty. I found that the software was not as user friendly as I would have expected. OK, I am still playing with the system and learning but once again, it sure would help having instructions.",positive
455,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 1 camera kit",$74.99,5,"When we first purchased cams back in 2017, we compared to Arlo and Ring before we chose Blink. Now we are up to 10 cams, covering every angle of the house. Here are my findings after using them for almost 4 years (and still buying more):
PROS:
> #1 video quality is excellent. Day time is a bit better than night, but night vision is as good as it gets with cams. POSITION of your cam matters a ton. I started out putting them way high up and quickly realized - if you actually want identifying features - they need to be lower. Otherwise... yeah you see someone walking past, but you cant ID anything, so what is the use.
> So inexpensive - so easy to integrate. Anytime we have ANYTHING we need to cover, we just order another cam and it literally takes 5 minutes to get it out of the box, batteries in, and added to existing system.. seriously - 5 minutes.
> The app is great. Very intuitive. Our first cams had very few ""advanced features"" every time i order new cams, they have improved their features. Now you are able to zoom all the way in to very small areas, to capture certain areas and exclude others.. For example - old cams you had to block off large sections of the capture area to avoid the cams picking up movement from trees, but now you can pinpoint one little part of a branch on a tree to exclude if its triggering the cam.
> Motion detection is very sensitive - but they have it tweaked just about right. It never misses anything, but if you setup your exclusion zones well - you can get it almost perfect. I dont have a lot of false alarms and I'm running 10 cams. We have one setup to look at the sidewak, and after much tweaking, we can actually exclude the street... but pick up both sidewalks on both sides of the street. You can setup the app to alert you or not alert you.. you can turn sound on or off on alerts. On windy days I do end up just going into the app and turning off all cams that are setup around lots of trees until the storm is over.. but thats like a few times a year.
> Super easy playback and control of cams. It's instant - you can control them in any way, very easily. If I am working on a project in the yard, I dont want my cams on for hours, running out of batteries - so I just go into the app and turn them all off. It takes seconds. Likewise - if i hear a noise at night, super easy to open the app and live view any cam so i can look all around the house and see everything happening outside, from every angle.
> Extremely easy to move around. We have had them for years - so we move them around occasionally. I even had mice in our crawlspace under the house at one point and just grabbed one of the cams off the side of the house and stuck it down there so I could catch them at night. Theres no commitment with these - no hard wiring so you can mount them anywhere and taking them on and off the mount takes 2 seconds.
> No subscription needed to store clips. thats BIG for us. We would not like blink as much if they changed that. We run a lot of cams and it just stays 100% full storage - we can still access a few weeks worth of video, it just deletes oldest. You can download/save any videos.
> Lots of mounting options. You have to buy them separately if you want anything special, but I have 3 different types of mounts - one for trees, one around porches that need to be secured so they cant be taken, and then the standard mounts for cams not at risk of being taken. There are camo skins as well - I have on in a tree that you pretty much cant see unless you know its there.
> Customer support is super decent. In the winter of 2018, one of my cams took on a green hue to the image when the temp went down to about 10 degrees outside. I emailed customer service explaining the issue and sent a screenshot and within 24 hours they asked me for the SN of the cam, and did a firmware update that fixed it. I was quite happy with that.
CONS:
> So while the batteries are awesome because the cams are so easy to move around and deal with... i blow through batteries. Fortunately, i just get 20 packs of AA's, but with 10 cams - even though Blink ~says~ batteries can last a year? it totally depends on usage. So we get LOTS of traffic on our front cams because we live in a busy area and have people walking past all day. I change out the batteries on every one of those front cams once a month. Granted - thats many hundreds of video captures and ideally, we should connect those cams to electricity somehow - that is an option with blink, but I dont mind changing batteries. On the cams in the back yard and side paths - I really can go once or twice a year changing those, except for the ones that catch a lot of foot traffic. So the battery usage is totally dependent on traffic. Personally - the cams are a big deal to me, so i dont mind it at all. Benefits totally outweigh the downsides.
> The biggest difference between Blink and some other companies is that i see other people with hardwired cams that can catch EVERYTHING in a continuous fashion, for hours. like the surveillance videos you see online where the cam just happened to catch something happening down the street...Blink doesnt work that way. it only captures immediate video clips, triggered by motion activation. It does store all videos.. you can see something weird in your yard and look back through videos to find out what happened - but it isnt 24 hours of continuous video feed.
> You can get gaps in your videos. So it can capture 1 minute of video at a time, but then it takes a small break before it starts capturing again, so if something is happening and its videotaping an event - it will record an entire minute of excellent footage - but then it takes a 5 second break before it starts recording again. that doesnt sound like a long time, and for security it's not normally an issue.. the average bad guy is in and out quickly.. but it is annoying that it takes 5 seconds to re-trigger. So.... 2 minutes of continuous video... but in the middle of that 2 minutes.. a 5 second break.
OVERALL - Super high video quality... cams you can move around super easily... a very easy app... I love blink and the upsides far outweigh any downsides. I always recommend it to people when they ask. You can cover your entire house at a super affordable price, you dont need to be rich at all.. Our 3 year old cams are still as good as our brand new ones. The peace of mind the cams bring me is priceless. I know every single thing happening everywhere, all the time outside. The affordability made it possible so that nothing can ever surprise us.",positive
456,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 1 camera kit",$74.99,5," We've got some bad actors in the hood, so it was time to catch them with some irrefutable evidence. Our XT2 is a little old and our Arlos are acting stupid. Saw this come out and had to give it a shot. It was time to upgrade. Plus, the specs of the possibility of TWO YEAR BATTERY LIFE is mindblowing. It's probably a lot less, but my Arlos would last a week with $10 CR123 batteries, so that had to go. Anything had to be better than those dinosaurs.

Set up was fairly easy. There is no real printed instruction manual, but those are rare today. Scanned the QR code and my smartphone popped me to their website with tons of tips, info, and even setup videos. The entire setup process is QR from the new Sync Module 2 to the camera itself. So don't make the mistake of slapping the batteries in and closing the camera unit like I did before I scanned the QR code. Whoops. Took less than 15 minutes to setup and sync. Signed up for a new Blink account so the old one won't get confused - plus there's several weeks of free cloud storage right now. Boom.

Set it up in a tree ACROSS from my house this time. When I put it over my door, my old cameras would flag every car or pedestrian close and far. All I want to see is the jerk stealing my UPS packages, so I flipped the perspective. The HD is super clean and clear, and the camera is at least 30 feet from the sync module with no problems connecting. Big plus there. And, there's a pretty powerful little speaker in this unit! I was really surprised at the volume this thing can push for such a small speaker. Now, when this alerts me to funny business, maybe I'll be able to yell at the perps. Probably not, because they'll be long gone by the time I see the notification. Still, this feature could be useful in warning your kids from doing something silly when you're not home.

The live view was disappointing, since you have to keep clicking the app to continue the live view for longer than 10-ish seconds. So you can't use this as a spying device or a baby monitor. Bummer. Also, the default recording time was like 5 seconds, probably to maximize battery life. You can't catch much in 5 seconds. I adjusted mine in the settings to about 20 seconds. I'll sacrifice battery life to catch a bad actor. Plus, there's a battery pack you can attach to this unit to increase battery life. I'll update in the future to let you know how the battery goes.

Overall, I'm impressed with the new Blink outdoor. It's gonna rain here in Florida soon, so I'll let you know how that goes as well as night shots when available.",positive
457,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 1 camera kit",$74.99,5,"I was fortunate to buy in early on the Blink camera system. Therefore, I have the included cloud coverage. Only recently did I find out just what an advantage that was.

After buying my initial system, I continued to add cameras to the initial sync module. I ultimately ended up having two additional sync modules from systems I purchased after the original system. I was under the impression that all my cameras had to be connected to the original sync module to continue receiving free cloud coverage.

I currently have a mixture of cameras to include 3-XT2, 4-Outdoor, 1-Indoor (2nd gen) and 2-Mini. I was using a schedule to arm the cameras, but I was disappointed that the system would not allow individual scheduling for each camera.

I recently decided to use my additional sync modules to divide my cameras into different zones and allow myself to set different schedules for each zone. Even if it meant the additional modules would not include free cloud coverage, I felt the scheduling control would be worth it.

I was happily surprised to find that even the newer modules set up under the original system included free cloud coverage. Therefore, I now have three different zones that can be individually scheduled. And furthermore, I can add up to 10 cameras to each module.

I only ran into one problem with the setup. The second module I had purchased had been sitting in the box for probably about a year. When I tried to add a camera to it, it would not connect. I called customer support and the first person wasn’t able to help me. I decided to investigate the problem myself and noticed there was a huge difference in the firmware on the second module.

I expected that the firmware of the second module would automatically update, and there was no way to initiate an update within the App. Since it didn’t automatically update, I called customer service back and told them the problem. The individual I spoke with didn’t seem to understand the issue, so I simply insisted that the module’s firmware had to be updated by them.

It took a number of increments to finally update the firmware once the issue had been escalated to the appropriately skilled technician. I insisted that the customer service representative stay on the line until the firmware of the second module exactly matched that of the existing module. I wasn’t trying to go through another 30 minute hold and 20 minute update again.

After the firmware was updated, I was able to add cameras to the second module. I will monitor the module to make sure future firmware updates occur.

I realize that the cloud coverage or camera support may change or discontinue in the future. But for the time being, I’m quite happy with my Blink system.",positive
458,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 1 camera kit",$74.99,3,"I've purchased a total of 4 Blink Outdoor + 3 Blink Mini cameras, plus a sync module and USB backup drive for the security system at my retail space. It's honestly probably the best and easiest way to get a security system installed without wires at a small business. Yes I have used Ring, and Canary. I prefer Blink. Since I’ve seen this now at brick and mortar retail locations, in addition to Amazon, I figure a review might help you make an informed purchase (spoiler, I love it).

This review really supports all of Blink’s camera products, as an ecosystem, though Amazon strangely would only let me review the standalone “Outdoor” camera. So you can infer details to the rest of Blink’s product lineup. You should know that Amazon purchased Blink in 2018, so I hope it gets some attention with new software features and hardware refresh.

Pros:
* Wireless. As long as you have reasonably good wifi, the cameras work. I use a mesh system to cover 6000+ sq ft of space, and all the cameras record and alert me.
* Battery. The outdoor cameras run on 2 AA lithium batteries. I don’t know how, but they last WAY longer than comparable rechargeable batteries for competing camera brands
* Price. Blink’s system is very price competitive. The mini cameras are downright cheap. The Outdoor cameras are competitive, considering how long the battery lasts, how small they are, how easy they are to install, and the superb reliability.
* Footage. Blink paid plan is cheap and stores a month of
* App. It’s simple and straightforward. Easy to view alert footage, and pull up recent footage. Wish it was easier to organize/review past footage… once you’re past a week it get tedious and hectic to find anything quickly and efficiently.
* Communication: You can speak into your phone with the app open and have a 2-way conversation with any party present at individual cameras. I’ve used this feature to communicate with staff, and also warn maleficent actors to leave the premises before I notify authorities.
* Sensitivity: You can customize a bunch of the toggles for camera recording, active area, sensitivity etc which is great. It’s not quite as intuitive as Ring or Canary which literally let you draw areas to avoid or record, but the toggles for the recording area as well as sensitivity triggers, recording length, quality, notification lights, etc are intuitive and great.

Cons:
* Multiple Locations: Currently Blink does not allow you to have multiple locations for your Blink system. This is a real bummer because I would easily buy this same system for my home, office, and to help keep an eye on my elderly parents at their house. Unfortunately you can’t. To do this you have to have a separate Blink account for each location, and manually log out and then log in to the location you want to pay attention to. That defeats the purpose of a security system, if you can’t receive timely notifications from all of your security cameras. If you have to manually review footage, it’s too late to help.
* User Access: Another big annoyance is you can’t selectively invite users to access your account with different access permissions. So currently I am the only person reviewing my Blink account. It would be a big help to delegate managers and other authorized administrators, especially in a multi-location environment where you want your family to have access to home security, your staff access to office security, but don’t want those groups to see the other cameras. I hope Blink implements robust user invitations and sharing access once Multiple Locations is supported.
* Geo-Fencing: There is no geolocated ability to arm, disarm, or set location-based trigger schedules for Blink. It’s either time, or manual arming or disarming. I also use a Canary system, and one of the big perks is the ability to have the system automatically switch gears if you or particular people come and go from a location. Wish I could do that for Blink, to have it automatically arm itself with the most sensitive settings when my staff leaves the location for the night.
* Auto-Delete: Once your USB drive is full, expect daily notifications that “local storage is full”. It asks you to delete footage to make room for more, which is pointless, because at the end of each day it will automatically do this (since the USB drive automatically clears old footage as needed, but still sends the annoying notification about storage being full).

Other:
* Neighbors App: Integrates with a community, I don’t use this much, but great feature to have especially for neighborhood safety.
* Amazon: You purchase your premium subscription through Amazon, and link your Amazon account to your Blink account.
* Alexa Integration: I use a series of Alexa devices with screens throughout the retail space to quickly look at cameras if I get an alert with my phone. Take a second to wake each camera (especially battery-operated Outdoor cams), and is very useful for safety and suspicious activity.
* Outdoor Mount: The outdoor cameras can be easily “popped” off their mount, if a maleficent person knows what’s up and decides to take a camera.
* Battery Life: The battery life of Blink Outdoor with 2 AA Lithium is good enough to not be a con. However the battery life is significantly less than “2 years” advertised. So far I’ve had to change the batteries on all four of my Outdoor cameras about every 3-4 months. Unfortunately there’s no alert or indicator to tell you if the battery is about to die. It’s either “OK” or the camera goes offline (with a slow blinking red light on the physical device).

VERDICT:

Blink is a great system, I totally recommend it as long as you only have one location and you are the sole user. The price is great, the performance is reliable with quality coverage, and it’s comparable, if not better than competitors.

If you need security systems at multiple residences or other locations, want to automate the system arming/triggers based on your geo-location, and need to invite and grant specific access to different people (friends vs staff) you should definitely avoid Blink and look to Canary or Ring for a security solution.

If the three major cons were address I would easily increase my rating from 3 to 5 stars. I hope Blink (and Amazon) is listening!",fair
459,Amazon Devices & Accessories,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 1 camera kit",$74.99,4,"I've only had these outdoor cameras for a few days, so I won't comment on battery life yet. But overall, I'm very happy with these cameras and most of their features. I'm nitpicking a bit here, which is why there are so many Cons. They are minor issues outweighed by the Pros.

PROS:
* Setup was relatively simple--once you understand it--but the instructions weren't (see below)
* Infrared is awesome in the darkest environments and does a good job switching between IR and non-IR automatically
* Motion detection works well, as does the 1-9 sensitivity setting, although this requires some tweaking until you find the right setting for each camera
* Daytime video quality is excellent and good enough to read stationary license plates up to about 50 feet.
* Audio quality is amazing! Individual birds and nearby bees can be heard easily, and normal volume conversations within about 20 feet can be understood.

CONS:
* The cameras seem to require an active Internet connection, not just a wifi connection (although I could be wrong). This may be because the initial setup requires you to use cloud storage. This could become a problem if your Internet connection is lost or dropped.
* Initial setup requires storage in the cloud (for the free trial), even if you install a USB drive in the sync module. I have not found a way to disable the cloud storage. This cloud storage requirement may be slowing down the entire system, since it forces everything to constantly use the Internet.
* Setup instructions were weird and unintuitive. The included booklet simply said to install the app. And the app is kind of confusing at first, and I ended up trying to create an account (and failing) and adding the sync module several times until I figured out what it was doing (and I'm an experienced techie). The basic problem is the app requires cameras to be installed only by following certain steps, with no other option.
* Setup requires the mobile app and an active internet connection to install the cameras.
* Accessing the cameras and video clips requires the mobile app. There are no desktop app or web options.
* Cannot schedule individual cameras. The weekly/hourly schedule can only be set for all cameras attached to a sync module. This is unfortunate and will make the scheduling feature useless for most people. It would also be helpful to be able to set quality, motion detection sensitivity, and IR settings on a schedule. The settings I use for night time would be different than the middle of the day or when I'm not at home.
* No quality setting on the audio. There are multiple settings for quality of the videos, to conserve batteries, but there's no way to turn down the audio quality, for battery conservation. The included audio quality is great, but it seems to be ""too"" high for the purpose of these cameras.
* Only 2 AA batteries in each camera. This could become very cumbersome to replace batteries if your camera is installed in a hard-to-reach location. The cameras SHOULD have 6, 8, or 10 batteries instead, so you don't have to replace them often. I would happily pay the extra battery cost so that I wouldn't have to climb up there very often.
* When a camera is ""in use"", its settings cannot be changed, and if you try to change the settings, you'll get an error message, causing the app's settings screen to get out of sync with the camera's actual settings, until you go back and modify the settings again.
* The ""Talk"" feature produces garbled, broken, delayed (by 3-5 seconds) audio that is unintelligible, no matter how close the camera and sync module are to your router. I have about 115 Mbps bandwidth, and it made no difference. You will never be able to use this to have a conversation of any type, even if they could understand what you're saying. This seems like a very odd flaw since the recorded audio is so excellent. This was obviously an oversight by the engineers.
* The Android app's setting to disable the vibration on notifications doesn't work. It always uses my phone's setting and ignores the app's setting.
* Insects near my 4 cameras are causing 15-30 false alerts per day right now, until I can figure out a better placement or setting. Other than the wear on the batteries, this is not a huge deal, but it can be annoying.
* The installation hardware is inadequate. Each camera comes with 2 large wood screws that are too big and too long for almost every installation. Much smaller wood screws and double-sided tape or Velcro would have been much more practical. I ended up not using any of the screws that came with the cameras because they were too big or impossible to use on the required surfaces.
* The back panels on the cameras are VERY weird to remove for battery installation. There are no instructions that I could find on how to do this, and the included plastic tools are not intuitive. I nearly broke one of the cameras trying to get the back panel off using the included tool. There's a certain trick to hooking and unhooking the tool from the back panel that you'll have to figure out on your own.
* The cameras and lenses are fully exposed to sunlight and weather, which is not ideal. The cameras should come with a small hood the lens or camera to protect it even more from weather and shade from light.
* User access cannot be customized. The only way to give someone access to a camera is to give them your password to your account and entire system. It would be helpful to be able to grant someone limited or temporary access, such as a neighbor, child, relative, or visitor.",positive
