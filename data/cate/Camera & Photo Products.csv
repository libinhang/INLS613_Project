0,Camera & Photo Products,"WYZE Cam v3 with Color Night Vision, Wired 1080p HD Indoor/Outdoor Video Camera",$35.98 - $70.96,5,"The Wyze team are killing it with this one. Their low cost products have always been a good draw. My prior Wyze camera was the pan camera - good price for one that I could make spin around and look up and down. I bought two v3 to get my side yards.

My primary cameras are nest...traditionally seemed to be the top of the line for this new generation of cloud based IP cameras - highest quality but highest cost. But at least with the nest app I felt I was getting what i paid for. Now those guys at Google made their new cameras not work with their own nest app, only the Google Home, which is crazy to me. The Google Home currently doesn't let you see the *entire* 24 hour history within your subscription time frame, which was always a key distinguisher from Ring and other IP cameras - only highlights! I had ordered a 2 pack of their new cameras on Prime Day but then did some more reading and found out about the lack of nest app support, and found my existing nest cams could not access more than highlights/alerts in Google Home app, and decided that was just not going to be good enough. I want to be able to look through the entire feed in case an alert didn't catch everything.

Then I decided to look at Wyze - I'd read their emails and was interested in their skylight night color and decided I would 'try' their $35 camera instead of the nest $120 camera. After all, the new v3 is outdoor rated, has great night vision and has a lower cost, can install SD cards for onboard extended feed coverage (not just alerts) and I'm already using the Wyze app for my two pan cameras so I'm already in the ecosystem in my Google Home. So I ordered 2 Wyze v3 cameras.

Installation - First, even the box is small...reminded me of the Blink camera size. I ordered SD cards for the v3 cams to give me that very long look-back ability (very cheap for the sizes needed). When I went to install I realized the USB cable/power line was thin - and I was able to run it inside my window track so as to NOT DRILL into my siding (because lets face it, eventually i may change to something different and who wants to put holes in their siding). Unfortunately I did have to poke the cable through the screen b/c my screen didn't slide up/down. Like I said, the camera is very small and light, so when I mounted I only needed one small screw (provided with kit) to hold it in place. There was a magnet ring around screw area, and that could have helped with the mount, but I didn't use it. The camera has left right and up down hinges so I was able to point it in the place I wanted to.

Performance - I am happy with the camera's performance. Its 1080p. One camera is on side with street light, and that area stays color lit with the starlight feature and yes can see pretty well. The other camera is in more shaded part and uses the gray IR feed, and yes I can see what's going on there pretty well. Unfortunately I don't think any of these cameras can ""zoom"" in and really see someone's face or a license plate, but that's just a limit they all have if you don't have a mechanical zoom presumably like the traditional fully wired camera security systems. But I'd say the picture quality is on par with my $350 nest outdoor v2 IQ camera. I haven't tried the higher level wyze plans with their version of person recognition, so can't comment on the facial recognition aspect, but I'm totally fine with losing that one feature when everything else has the $35 camera totally pacing the $350 camera. What a value difference and its crazy the quality you get for this price point. Wyze is really a super top level choice in the budget to mid-level home camera market. Extremely happy.",positive
1,Camera & Photo Products,"WYZE Cam v3 with Color Night Vision, Wired 1080p HD Indoor/Outdoor Video Camera",$35.98 - $70.96,5,"I like these little cameras! Setup was a breeze, picture quality is amazing, and the live feed is pretty much actually live (less than a 1 second delay for me, which was the best of all the newer cameras I tested - more about that below). Real time live video is important to me for various reasons. For example, one of my dogs keeps peeing in the house (marking), and if I can't catch him just before he pees then he's never going to learn to stop doing that. With a delay of even 3-4 seconds, I would be too late.

These cameras are small and light. The base is magnetic and very adjustable, and there are also adhesive and screw-in options for mounting. Low light performance is exceptional - the IR night vision isn't needed until it's pretty much completely dark.

The app is so-so.. it is responsive and more or less intuitive, and it does have all the basic capabilities needed. It just lacks some features that I would have liked. For example, you can't fast forward through event videos or continuous recordings. To jump to other points you have to move a bar on the timeline.. it is very difficult to skip just a tiny bit ahead. I keep going too far, then going back too far or not far enough, and it's a pain. You have to guess where to look for things.

For this reason, continuous recording was not a great solution for me, because it was too hard to find events. Recording events only is better, but I'd still like the ability to fast forward, or to see the actual video as you move your finger along the timeline.

Speaking of recording events only to your SD card: SD card recordings are NOT subject to the 12 second video/5 minute cooldown that you get with the free cloud recordings. If you choose ""events only"" in the settings, it will break time into 1 minute increments, and it will continue recording until motion stops. This wasn't made clear in any of the documentation I could find, and the live chat agent gave me incorrect information. I almost gave up and returned these before even opening them, but first I decided to message them on Facebook. The Facebook messenger representative gave me the correct information and links to where I could find more detailed information on their website. So, crisis averted.

The audio is pretty terrible in recorded events. It sounds like you're talking from across a long tunnel while holding your hand over the microphone. When right up next to the camera outside, I can understand speech, but it still does not sound good. It is slightly better indoors. I don't know what the sound is like for the live feed though, and I don't know how it sounds when I talk through the camera. (I haven't had anyone here to help me test things like that. The dogs won't cooperate, they all want to be in the same room as me all the time).

For me, the fact that there is almost no lag in the live video more than makes up for the shortcomings in audio. Plus the price is great -- a lot more than they were before May, unfortunately, but still very competitively priced. As soon as they're in stock anywhere, I'll be adding two pan cameras for inside, and maybe their doorbell, depending on whether or not there is enough space on my door frame.

Here are all the cameras I've had/tried, to give you all some comparisons. This will be long, but the summary is that between Dericam, Blink, Eufy, Eufy Solo, LittleElf, and Wyze, I liked the Wyze ones best.
I did not test Ring because they are really expensive and have no options for local storage at all. You have to pay for a subscription for each camera if you want to view recordings. I didn't test Arlo because they're expensive and I hadn't gotten to them yet. No need to do more testing now though, I'm keeping the wyze cameras.

1. Original indoor cameras that I want to replace - Dericam 1080P P2, indoor pan/tilt, purchased in 2017. They're old now and are showing their age, but there is virtually no lag time at all in the live feed, and you get all features and local storage without ever paying any fees. The app is kind of buggy and annoying (and slow by today's standards), but these cameras served me well for 3-4 years. They are deteriorating now though, and it's time for an upgrade.

2. Blink mini outdoor, 5 camera kit (ordered on prime day, so I got a really good deal). The Blink cameras were really nice (image quality, sound, features, ease of installation), but I had a consistent 3 second delay in the live feed. (My network is not the issue.) It's really too bad, those seemed perfect otherwise. I tried every single troubleshooting step and anything that other people mentioned having done in message boards. No difference though, I always had a 3 second delay, so I returned them.

3. Littlelf 1080P, pan/tilt etc. Priced around what wyze cameras cost. As far as I can tell this company only makes indoor cameras, so I would have had to get a different brand for outside, and use two apps to keep track of my house. Not really want I want, but Lifflelf promised the ability to see multiple live streams at the same time, so I wanted to try them. That feature does work and is actually really nice. Good image quality (but not as good as the other newer ones), good audio, an app that was a little clunky but definitely usable... but I had a 4 second delay with these cameras, so they went back.

4. Eufy - EufyCam E, 2-cam kit. These were by far the most expensive cameras I tried, but they promise a year of battery life, and I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get power outside at that point. The cameras seem really solid and well made. I had no trouble adding the homebase and camera, although I did have a lot of trouble creating my account in the first place. The app seemed less intuitive than Blink or Wyze - (not a dealbreaker), but worked. Image quality was great, sound was great, but I found that these had a 3-4 second delay. For the price, they would have had to be perfect.

5. Eufy Solo IndoorCam P22 (pan/tilt), and Solo OutdoorCam C22 (which looks like a big eyeball, I really liked the design). The price of the indoor cameras was similar to Wyze, but their outdoor cameras were a lot more. I thought that since these cameras connect directly to wifi and not to a base, they'd be faster. I was wrong though, I had the same 3-4 second delay as with the other Eufy cameras. Video quality is great, but not as good as the wyze v3 in my opinion. Audio quality was really good with these. But the delay was a dealbreaker.

The End. I applaud you if you got this far!",positive
2,Camera & Photo Products,"WYZE Cam v3 with Color Night Vision, Wired 1080p HD Indoor/Outdoor Video Camera",$35.98 - $70.96,5,"UPDATE:
I am very satisfied with these guys. I bought a few cameras and it was quick and easy setting them up. Whatever questions I had were answered promptly (via email). They emailed me a discounted annual plan. I chatted with a representative to inquire more about it. I was told it’s only sent to some customers and it’s for a limited time (of course). I ordered it and had no issues. Then a week later they send me an even better subscription that only covered the cameras I had (previous subscription covered an extra camera but I got it because it was still cheaper overall). I canceled the previous subscription and ordered the best one that works for me. My setup is perfect now. These guys actually care about their customers cause I spoke to 3 or 4 different people and they all resolved my issue without ending the chat.

Here’s a tip to avoid my initial subscription mistake. If they email you a bundle deal, say something like “Cam Plus bundle for 4”, only select one for the deal! I would mistakenly select 4 and get 16 licenses (instead of just 4 for 4 cameras). The reason I made this mistake is because their website asked “how many cameras?” right under the bundle package. So whatever the bundle you want, just select 1, because the bundle will cover whatever amount of cameras that are in the title. Then go to your wyze app and select your cameras under your subscription to add them.

I haven’t been paid or pressured or asked to make this review. I only felt like updating this cause I’m a happy customer. If something goes wrong I’ll update it again and change my rating.

Original Review:
I’ve lived alone for a while now. I was burglarized once. Even then, it didn’t occur to me to get a camera, but now since they’re mostly cloud based I figured I’d try one. I settled on wyze cause of the price. Pretty cheap for what they offer ($3 per camera per month). And I get the first 3 months free. So far I have no issues. I set one up in my living room facing the front door of my apartment.

Though I admit it’s a weird feeling seeing myself walking around, doing my daily routine, under constant surveillance lol. But it’s not necessarily in a paranoid “big brother is watching you” kinda way. I’m just more aware of my behavior, so there’s an adjustment period. After all I wanted more security. And you can set it to record movement only or sound or whatever you want really.

From my understanding, the cloud service saves 2 weeks of footage then it’s deleted unless you specifically want something saved to the SD card. The night vision on this thing is as good as the day time, though it takes a few seconds for it to realize the lights are off.

Actually I have one minor complaint, but it’s not a dealbreaker per say. It’s the notifications…I finally got them working how I wanted but it took a ton of research to figure out how. Basically I don’t want movement notifications when I’m at home. I want them when I’m not home (e.g. at work). I would set up the schedules without any overlap yet the notifications won’t stop. Apparently, you need to wait until the next day for the notifications to work properly. So say you make a new “rule” for no notifications between 3pm and 10pm, but it’s 4pm right now….you’d have to wait until 3pm the next day for the notifications to stop. The camera doesn’t immediately put that rule into effect even though it knows what time it is, strange (or just lazy coding).

Anyway, that’s my honest review. I’m a happy camper and gave it 5 stars anyway. I’ll update this review if it suddenly stops working or something.",positive
3,Camera & Photo Products,"WYZE Cam v3 with Color Night Vision, Wired 1080p HD Indoor/Outdoor Video Camera",$35.98 - $70.96,5,"There's a lot to like about these little cameras, so I'll start with the pros first before moving on to a few (mostly negligible) cons.

Pros:
Image quality is very good. 1080p is crystal clear and the ability to zoom, even on event recordings, is a great feature to have. The Starlight feature is also great. I have one camera mounted on an upstairs window facing out and the image quality even in the middle of the night is great. Unless it's very dark, I'd leave the Starlight feature on instead of the standard IR night vision.

Connectivity has been stable and reliable. I check my cameras often when I'm away from home and I've yet to experience any connection issues. I've only had it for a couple of months, so I can't speak on the longevity, but I have dealt with Wyze customer support on some issues I had with their home security hub and the customer service has been very good. Good enough that I plan to keep them as my primary home security system.

You can mount them practically anywhere. They come with several different mounting options, ranging from a standard flat base built into the camera, to 3M mounting strips, an even drywall anchors. The supplied power cord is a reasonable length for most applications, but you'll want to look into a longer USB-to-Micro USB cord if you plan on mounting more than 6-7 feet from a power outlet. They say they're rated for outdoor use, which is a nice touch. I only use mine inside, though I did buy their window mount that allows one of my cameras to face outside and not be subjected to the elements.

They do a decent job detecting people, vehicles, and even animals! Even the cam I have facing the street picks up on moving vehicles, people walking their dogs, etc., from several hundred feet away.

Rules and detection zones, detection sensitivity, and many more options are available, though some require a subscription.

Cons:
Some people might be turned off by the subscription required to view certain events. You *can* install a Micro SD card and get limited event viewing options, though the Cam Plus subscription is also a good deal and gives you a lot of extras like person detection, cloud storage, and the ability to view longer event clips along with other features. The subscription is worth it if you're looking for a home security solution. If you're just looking for a camera to keep an eye on your pets while you're away, then you can probably get by without a subscription. They give you a 2-week trial of the Cam Plus so you can see what it's capable of. If you don't need it, then just install your SD card and go about your day.

The camera does a decent job recording audio but the speaker on it is puny, so talking to someone through it sounds like you're yelling into a tin can from the camera's end. The communication feed may be better on their products like the doorbell cam, but I don't have one of those to test out.

Those minor cons aside, these cameras have worked flawlessly for me since I've had them. I honestly didn't expect so much from such inexpensive cameras. Like I mentioned earlier, I have had to deal with their customer service on another Wyze product (not any of their cameras I own) and they have been great at helping troubleshoot issues and didn't hesitate to send a replacement product when the troubleshooting didn't work. It's great that they stand behind their products.",positive
4,Camera & Photo Products,"WYZE Cam v3 with Color Night Vision, Wired 1080p HD Indoor/Outdoor Video Camera",$35.98 - $70.96,4,"Ordered one from Amazon, $35. Like that camera can sit inside on window sill, flush to the glass of the window, and perfect video picture, night vision is spectacular (have read some ambient light outside is required). No need to worry about batteries or wiring, it plugs into the wall. You also do not need a subscription for just basic usage, but it will only film an event and notify you once every 5 minutes if you opt for no subscription. For $15/year, it is unlimited with no 5 minute pause between even detections. Has a micro SD slot (micro SD card not included), we just used one we had, but not necessary for camera operation. It can also be paired with other appliances through an IFTT app like a garage door.
The MAJOR ISSUE is that even though you may set your detection area, the detection is via a change in pixels (where Ring, Blink, etc. are infrared and detect a heat source) and we receive an EXCESSIVE DETECTION NOTIFICATIONS when the sun sets and shines through the leaves or at night when car headlights flash across the detection area. We have also read where people receive excessive detection notifications when it rains or bugs attracted to light, but we have not had an opportunity to put it to the test with these. The only solution to minimize these notifications for these non-events is to move the camera or to set up rules to silence events during certain times of the day. For the cost, we decided we can live with this. Our walk around for now, is to just have one family member's phone receive alerts. And the other family members must block the alerts for this specific app in the settings of their phone (not within the app, or it blocks everyone's notifications).
Only the initial person who sets up the camera on the app, can make a lot of the changes to the camera within the app. And other family members are just shared access to the camera and can set up their own rules. The initial person who did the set up will receive notifications a split second before the people it is shared with.
Ordered a 2nd one that was supposed to be new, but WAS OPENED and still had the UPS stickers on it with the customer's name and address who had returned it. So returning the 2nd camera and ordering a replacement, hopefully this one will be new.
Realize with any electronics that receive updates (like with cell phones, fitness trackers, etc), they do not have an infinite life due to technology restrictions so another reason to go for this budget friendly option. I believe Wyze retired support for their 1st model after 5 years.
Price on Wyze website was $29.99 ($57.98 for 2) plus $5.99 shipping, but decided buying it from amazon would make sure we had free returns with Prime. Wyze is a company started by former Amazon employees and it is based in Seattle.
Update: very sensitive to raindrops on the window, birds, neighbors' lights turning on and creates an event and notification.",positive
5,Camera & Photo Products,"WYZE Cam v3 with Color Night Vision, Wired 1080p HD Indoor/Outdoor Video Camera",$35.98 - $70.96,1,"I installed several v3's 7 months ago. They worked well. However, Wyze was constantly requiring me to install endless updates. It seemed like every week or two. Well, the last update bricked all of my camera's.

Power cycling did nothing. So I took a couple of the camera's down and reset them. All of them went back on line without a problem. However, as soon as I unplugged them to reinstall them, guess what! Dead again. I reset them again--three times same result. Each time they were power cycled they went into the install mode and wouldn't come out of it so they could reconnect.

I called Wyze tech support and they made me repeat all the steps I had already done multiple times. Why? Because the support person doesn't know much about the camera's, they're simply reading from a help desk script, and they have to check off the boxes or they get in trouble.

They tried to convince me it was my fault. The network router wasn't good enough. Too many things were connected to it. On and on. I'm an engineer so I know BS when I hear it. All the cameras worked fine until the update. Then bricked. That's not a coincidence, and they know it. They've had the brick problem happen numerous times, so tech support has heard it all before. Any little info packet problem, minor power spiking (which is normal) or any other type of interference can cause the flash update to go wrong.

Wyze finally agreed to replace all of the cameras, but it took about three hours going in circles with them. I've already spent close to six hours taking cameras down, testing them, talking to tech support twice, and now I've got to reinstall all the cameras again. These are good, inexpensive cameras--when they work. Tech support is available, but watch out because every problem is caused by something on your end. They really love to blame the router.

Bottom line--they just don't want to replace the cameras if they can convince you everything is your fault. This time they did replace them, which I appreciate. They asked me to return the failed cameras, which I don't mind, but it's just more of my time. Their engineers want to look at them. Really! They'll be sitting in a box somewhere with the other few thousand failures. They'll get to mine around 2026 when someone throws them in the trash bin.

When the time I've spent is taken into consideration, these cameras aren't very cost effective. My time isn't free, even though Wyze acts like it is. We'll see how long the new ones last. If their ""technical team"" keeps updating every few weeks like they're doing now, they'll brick some more cameras. It's the risk of e-prom updates. I would skip the updates, but they pop up a nag screen every time I open a camera. It's annoying. Clicking ""don't show again"" is just another waste of time. Customers aren't sitting around waiting for every minor change in the software. One or two updates a year would be adequate. Let me decide if I want the updates. Oh, that won't work because some of the updates are about taking away stuff like the 12 second videos that originally came with the cameras. What a crock!

It takes about an hour and half to set up a half dozen cameras. Each camera has to be updated from 1 to 4 times during the setup process depending on when it was manufactured. That takes a lot of time. Then it will take me another hour to hour and a half to reinstall them. In total, this brick update will cost me 9 to 10 hours of my time at least.

Wyze has better tech support than most security camera companies. It's just slow having to go through the help screen over and over no matter how many times something has already been done. One tech support person was willing to sit on hold while I uninstalled one from the roof. Ok, let me whip out the ladder, climb on the roof and do that for you. I guess they wanted their lunch break.

At least they replaced the cameras, THEY ruined.

I took one of the old bricked cameras that I didn't have to send back, and I re-flashed it with a clean update. That failed also, so whatever happened during the update when the cameras were installed is permanent. That's another design flaw. There's no way to reverse an update and fix a problem.

Tech Support 3 or 4 stars--depending on who happens to answer the phone.
Cam V3 (when it works) 4 stars
Constant Updates 1 star
Camera Software 3 stars
Wasting my time 1 star
Wifi issues 2 stars

I'll use them without EVER updating them again--at least until they force an update, which they do from time to time. I think they have a hardware problem that needs fixing. When lots of people are reporting their cameras have bricked after updates, or after a power recycle, it's not a random glitch. When I was buying the camera's, Wyze didn't mention anywhere that I needed to have them within 10 feet of my router, or whatever they think the maximum distance should be, for them to update properly. The problem with their wifi strength argument is if my cameras are in a location where they have constant, stable wifi connection 24/7 with no problems recording video to the micro SD card, then that should be adequate wifi connectivity for an update. The previous 10 updates completed with no problems. Again, they should be asking a lot of questions about why updates and power cycling are bricking cameras. There's a solution to this problem, if they want to find it.",negative

The easiest set up and many great features if you opt in for the cam plus. The camera works fine with the memory chip and if you want to live stream.. However you need the cam plus if you want to look back at alerts or history and with cam plus you can choose alerts for people, pets and cars. Otherwise it will alert you on any motion if you don’t get the CamPlus.. it’s 18.00 per year.The notifications are better than my ring camera and the twilight vision works amazing.
Almost gave it 5 stars
I had to take off a star because I bought 4 cameras I loved them so much however the free trial would not load up. 2 of the cameras had 3 months cam plus free and that’s where it got complicated it took hours of resetting everything and trying many times..Finally it now shows I have 3 months free before I will get billed. It’s normally 14 days free but if you check Amazon they have them the same price 35.00 with 3 months of cam plus while it’s still available it’s a great deal.

Still love the camera 35.00

7,Camera & Photo Products,"WYZE Cam v3 with Color Night Vision, Wired 1080p HD Indoor/Outdoor Video Camera",$35.98 - $70.96,4,"We had some of these around at work and I played with them and decided to pick up a couple for myself for home since I was frustrated with my old ones. I have a few thoughts, but overall I'm very happy with them.

1. I bought an Alexa with the screen so I could monitor one of the cameras at my computer, since I found out after purchase that there is no web interface, you have to use your phone. This is my first time having an Alexa as well, and I'm disappointed that the Wyze app for Alex frequently disconnects. I can tell alexa to show me the cam, and sometimes it will stay up for a few days, sometimes it will disconnect for no reason after 10 minutes and I'll have to tell Alexa to pull it up again. It's not a huge deal, it's just annoying if you're looking for a way to monitor a camera for activity for a specific purpose.

2. The camera itself will disconnect from wifi occasionally. It's not frequent enough to be a big deal, but like the Alexa thing, just another minor annoyance that I wish didn't happen. I'd say once a month or so I have to unplug and replug the camera to have it reconnect to wifi.

3. The software is annoying, and has the same issues as my previous camera of another brand. The actual activity monitor unless you have it stationed in a specific area where the lighting is static is basically useless. It doesn't matter how you change the settings, what are you set as active or anything. This thing will freak out at anything, and sometimes it's just it's own rendering of pixels. I've pretty much come to terms with the fact that this just needs to be off.

4. The camera itself, for the price is by far the best I've found on the market. Honestly the picture quality is phenomenal, you have a lot of room to zoom in and around on things, and the quality of the picture with night vision on OR off during the night is second to none.

The overall quality, price and honestly the fact that it's reliable 98.5% of the time is the reason I choose to use these cameras over a lot of other options. Like I said, there's a couple minor annoyances that I really wish could be shaped up, and if they were this would be an absolutely perfect product. That and, you know the motion detection software being actually useful, but honestly I don't need it for that reason really.",positive
8,Camera & Photo Products,"WYZE Cam v3 with Color Night Vision, Wired 1080p HD Indoor/Outdoor Video Camera",$35.98 - $70.96,5,"I helped set up a couple of these for my 74-year-old father-in-law. Downloading the app and registering each camera was extremely simple. He registered the app, pressed a button on the side of the camera, pointed the camera at the QR code in the app, and viola! Easy as cake.
Mounting the camera under the eaves required 1 screw. We ran power to a plug using a 20-foot USB extension cable (purchased separately). The connections were waterproofed by wrapping them with self-fusing silicone tape.
We selected the V3 cameras because it supports 128Gb SD cards that will continue to record activity even in WiFi goes down. It appears data capacity for a 128Gb card is ~7 days of 24x7 data when set to HD (1080P), ~14 days at SD (720P), and ~28 days at 360p.

10,Camera & Photo Products,"All-new Ring Stick Up Cam HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa",$79.99 - $199.97,5,"I have a much better security camera system for my home's exterior but thought I might try one of these cams indoors since I have the Ring alarm system and a Ring Doorbell already. I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't. None. Not a single thing.

It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways. I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed. Nope.

I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn't in the house. Nope. There isn't even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you're home or not. They are not location aware in any way. The Ring alarm system isn't either, so I suppose I should have known better already.

I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording. Nope!

The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours. Note, this doesn't stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts.

Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever.

Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room. I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on. This is a high traffic area so I wasn't holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%. This is with all the 'battery saving options' on. This was only a test as I don't actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I'm home unless the alarm is armed or going off.

With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it's recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording. So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing. I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn't burning down.

Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it's other devices.

This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality. The audio isn't great but it never is on cameras of any kind.

***UPDATE***
Ring support reached out to me directly almost immediately after I posted my review (Good on them) and told me how to link the Alarm, somewhat, to the camera. You have to go into your Base Station settings, then linked devices, then you can set the cameras to record when the alarm goes off - but only then. Make sure you have the updated app that just came out to do this. I didn't. Again, the setting is in your base station, not in the cameras.

This solved probably the biggest issue I had with the camera. The rest of my review is still accurate though per Ring support. Hopefully they'll add the other much needed features in the near future.

***ANOTHER UPDATE***
From Ring Support: ""The Modes feature will be released in November and will allow you to have the option to record motion only if the Ring Alarm System is set to Away Mode"". This will be a great update and should have been available on launch. I wonder if they are only just now thinking of it from all the negative feedback and reviews, but glad it's 'coming soon' either way.

***ONE MORE UPDATE***
Ring provided me early access to the 'Modes Feature' and I've been using it for the past few days. It resolves all the issues I had with the alarm integration. With modes you can set your cameras to only record when your alarm is set. They can all be set independently and act differently depending on if you have your alarm set to off, home, or away. For instance, you can set your exterior cameras to record when your alarm is set to home mode, but have your interior cameras are turned off. You can set your interior cameras to only record while in away mode, etc. etc. Or any combination. The cameras can now be set the same way motion and door sensors can. This is a great improvement. They haven't told me exactly when this feature will be made public but have said it will be released 'by the end of the year'.

I've increased the rating from 3 stars to 5. This software update really has resolved every issue I had with the cameras. I've now ordered and installed an additional 6 for my home.

***LAST UPDATE***
Having the modes features and my cameras set to only pop on and record during an alarm event (which is rare) and be off at all other times, I've had 2 months to evaluate battery life, almost exactly 60 days now. All my cameras were down to below 10% battery level when I checked them last night. Given the rate of battery drain I had expected them to last 3 months - though 2+ still isn't bad. I have two external cameras on my entry gates outside with the solar panel add-on, they stay fully charged at all times even though it's pretty much been non-stop dark and cloudy days here since installation. They are set to record all motion and since they point at a street they record events dozens of times per day... so if you're thinking of getting the solar panels for outdoor use, I highly recommend them.",positive

This is like leaving your front door open while on vacation. Your camera is sending and receiving signals over a wireless network. Anyone within range of the signal can potentially be a threat if you don't have good encryption (username and good password) set up on your camera. There's no logical reason for a Ring owner to not do this. Ring even stresses changing the default settings during the initial setup process. Bottom line, don't blame the car manufacturer if you leave the keys in your car and it gets stolen.

Recently, I wrote a rather scathing 1 star review about the problems I was having with my new Ring Stick Up Wireless Battery Cam. I'm no stranger to wireless cams, having 10 hooked up and running seamlessly on another network as I write this, but I was totally frustrated with the connection reliability, not only with my two upper end cellphones, but also on my Galaxy Tab and Amazon Show. More times than not, the software wouldn't connect with the camera but when it did, the video was choppy. Notifications were also hit and miss. I have a great wireless mesh router system throughout the house, so after doing all the troubleshooting I could think of, I assumed it was due to faulty hardware or software. I gave up and started the return process through Amazon. It was a new product after all and new products sometimes are really buggy. Plus, I read other negative reviews which seemed to justify my thoughts and actions.
Then I got an email from a gentleman from Ring saying he read my review and asked if I'd be willing to let him help troubleshoot my issues with me. Although I had already started the return process, I was willing. It was refreshing to know Ring Customer Service was genuinely interested in troubleshooting possible defects in their newest product.
Together, we isolated the issue within about 20 minutes. It turned out it wasn't the camera or software after all.
Anyone having connection issues should do what he advised me to do. Open up the Ring app and click on the 3 little dots to the upper right of the camera screenshot, then select settings. From there go to Device Health and check the signal strength. Although I had a good mesh hub (inside) within 10 feet of my camera (mounted outside), my signal strength was RSSI -64. He stated that the signal was so weak it was on the cusp of what is needed for the camera to even minimally operate. This prompted me to reboot my wireless mesh system and reset/reconnect the camera. When it came back online, my signal strength went to -39, a vast improvement.
A quick check of all of my devices showed the camera and software working flawlessly. Hat's off to Ring.
Anyone who may be having connection or audio/video/notification difficulties, check your signal strength to the camera via the Ring software, even if your router is close by. You just might be surprised.
***UPDATE***
Camera (and software) is still working flawlessly on all devices.
Ring has now updated their Windows 10 desktop app (which previously didn't work with the new wireless battery cams) and it works flawlessly as well.
Observations.
Notifications on my phone, Tab and Amazon devices (Show, Echo, Dot) are almost instantaneous. Alexa says ""Someone is at your front door."" Very cool.
I bought an extra battery, but it looks like it'll be at least a few months before I need to swap it out, even with the intensive testing I've done on the Stick Up Cam. Battery life seems excellent.
I have one zone blocked out and that seems to work fine as well. I also have it mounted a couple of feet above and to the left of my front door, tilting downward at an angle. Even though residential traffic is visible in the field of view, I've not gotten one trigger due to street activity. The motion sensor is triggered by anything coming into the bottom half of it's field of view. From the time someone triggers the motion sensor until the time I'm aware of it is 1-2 seconds. That's about as close to real time as you can get. It's not given me a false alarm even once.
Telling my Amazon Show to ""(Alexa), show front door cam"" takes about 5 seconds to complete.
I can also watch triggered video clips and get a live feed while away from home without any extra setup to my network. It's totally automatic.
Because of the customer service I received from Ring and the fact the product is much better than I originally thought, I will be expanding my Ring family soon.",positive

I have still not been able to resolve this issue with the gen3 version of this camera in my particular networking situation. However, Ring customer service did reach out to me after writing my first review. They have been very helpful in offering troubleshooting suggestions, which eventually lead to the offer to return the cameras. This makes sense because 3 out of the 4 I am returning are unopened and the 4th was opened and only used to test connection to the network. I am very grateful that they understood the situation and made an exception in this case.

To be clear, my network situation is unique in circumstances as most people will not be using Verizon hotspot data as their internet provider when using their Ring cameras. Though I have heard of similar situations not working for other types of connections, some of those could also be a users home network settings and can be fixed. Bottom line is that Ring will make sure you are taken care of if it truly is a non working situation. The representative was clear and did not just run off of a script. He understood when I explained what I had already tried and did not ask me to repeat any trouble shooting steps that I had already been through before.

I have about 20 other ring cameras that are working rock solid, so this is all good news it is getting resolved. I still need a solution to cover these areas, so I will be trying Rings Spotlight Cam Battery's which I have had success with before. I am not sure if they have been revised from their earlier models, so I will update this review if I have better luck with those.

Hopefully whatever is going on with those gen3 can be targeted and fixed by a firmware patch or something, as I think the Stick Up cams are great value for the type of application I need them for.

(Original Review May 6, 2021)
The gen 3 Stick Up Cam Battery seems to have gone through some changes since the gen 2 that seem to create issues. I am an experience networking tech with around a dozen of the older stick up gen 2 cameras. I have had no issues with any of these cameras, so naturally when it was time to purchase more I thought it would be fine to use their gen 3 models instead. I think I have 6 gen 3 models now, and at least 3 of the 6 exhibit this same issue. I can say the new mounting has its pros and cons, but the real problem is compatibility with networks / ISP. You may be rolling the dice on whether or not it will work at all, as there are several reports of the same issues I am having. All of my gen 2 cameras are and have been running rock solid for months if not over a year at a time. Using the same networks, even right up close to the router, these gen 3 cameras will not send video. Whether it is a live view, or trying to review past motion events the recording is always a black screen. Everything in the settings says that things are connected and working correctly and have great RSSI. Motion notifications and events seem to trigger just fine and the thumbnail is updated in the video menu, but nothing but a blank screen when it comes to any actual video footage. I have tried this on 3 different networks all with the same results. Each of which currently have active and working gen 2 stick up cams with no issues.

However and strangely enough, the only way I can get the gen 3 model to show live video is by connecting it to a t-mobile hotspot of all things. Everything seems to work perfect and speedy when it is connected the t-mobile hotspot which shows that the camera itself is technically functioning. When I use a verizon hotspot to connect I get the same blank screen for video. So basically these gen 3 models are all unusable for my network because of this mystery bug.

I have read dozen of reports of this same thing happening on the community forums for ring. It seems calling tech support just gives the customers the runaround because they want to blame it for networking problems. But why do the gen 2 models work just fine on the same networks? Something is wrong with these gen 3's that everyone should be aware about. I do not have the time to waste calling ring tech support just to have them guide me through their scroll down menu techniques of how to troubleshoot these things just to blame it on the network or user error when I have already done those things and 10x more.

If i wasn't passed the 30 days return period having to try and figure out this issue I would gladly return them all. But I still need cameras for these areas so I would prefer that the problem was fixed, or they were replaced with something that works. If you experiencing these blank video screens as well, make sure you make it known.",positive
13,Camera & Photo Products,"All-new Ring Stick Up Cam HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa",$79.99 - $199.97,4,"I love Ring products, but the Stick Up Cam ""battery"" isn't my favorite for a few reasons:

1) Being battery-powered, response time is notably slower than with Ring's wired products.
2) It doesn't record the moments immediately before it detects motion as many of Ring's wired products do, so people are often leaving the frame of view just as the video starts to record.
3) Wireless connectivity is good, but not great, and often yields delays in connecting to live view or intermittent drop-outs from the network. I don't have the same issue with my other Ring devices, some mounted further away from the wifi source. Again, I believe this is related to the lower power consumption required to accommodate a battery as the main power source.

On the other hand, the overall design is great, video detail is very good, and night vision works well. Plus, good deals can be found on these and the use of a battery, while requiring monitoring for charge and replacement every few years, really gives this version flexibility in mounting that few other products on the market can match.

All in all, I'm fairly happy with the ""battery"" version of this camera, but it just isn't quite as powerful and fully featured as some of the other Ring products.",positive

I was worried about having to frequently charge the battery and had already planned to purchase the solar panel charger from Costco.

The picture quality is much better than my POE system which is supposed to be 1080p (HD). The only issue I have is when it detects motion, the first 1 to 3 seconds of the video is staggered/stuttering. This would not normally be a problem but I've noticed when I enter my pool area and later view the video, the first few frames stutter then I am out of view but now have perfect video of nothing happening.

This ring step stick up camera has frustrated me beyond anything I could ever begin to tell you. After going around with the ring every single day this past week I finally found a technician who somewhat started to make sense. He felt it was my internet speed so initially he said it was the upload speed And then after that didn't work he then said it was the download speed. But I do believe we were in I contacted my internet provider and I had them increase my download and my upload speed That did not work Then today I had them send a technician out to look over what was going on with my wireless box my wired box my router and outside aspects.the right He spent 2 hours here He rewired he changed out boxes He replaced my modem to the most current modem they have and I am pleasantly surprised to say that everything has been working for the last 10 hours. That is the longest that camera has worked. So quite obviously it was my internet. I just wished ring instead of keep sending me out cameras had initially said you know your Wi-Fi it could be your Wi-Fi and that isn't what occurred up until the last couple of conversations. So if you're having issues with that stick up camera it could be your Wi-Fi. My ring doorbell has been perfect from day one never an issue That was wired this stick up camera is solar I don't know if that has anything to do with it but truly the issue was my Wi-Fi so I wanted to be able to update everybody. Cuz my last couple have not been very nice or very good. So I love the ring stick up camera premise it is now working great and I upgraded my star review to four stars. If anything changes I will come back and update.area of the issue.
February 9th 2020 update.
This is the most unstable camera I have ever used. every day since this has been installed I have called ring because the camera goes offline or it takes an hour and a half to reset itself. last time I called I was on the phone with them for an hour and a half and they said that the device was defective. They sent me out a new one that was installed yesterday. At 4 p.m. by 6:25 p.m. the camera was not working again. I called ring this morning and it went from defective camera to it's my internet. If that were the case and it's my internet the ring security system wouldn't be working the ring chime wouldn't be working the ring doorbell 2 wouldn't be working my cell phone wouldn't be working my TV wouldn't be working etc etc etc. I'm ready to fling this flipping thing cuz I'm just playing tired. I called this morning and had to escalate my call to a manager while they're very nice at ring and I've said that from the get-go when somebody calls you every day for two weeks with the same issue and then today you're being told after all this time that it's not their camera and now it's my internet and it could be a firewall and it could be this then wouldn't it firewall for every single ring product that I have which is multiple? So I finally got the manager to agree to send somebody out here to figure this out. I am legally blind this morning's phone call was they wanted me to climb a ladder and reset the camera which is about 10 feet up. No can do. On top of that I've paid somebody three times to come out here to install their products to replace the cameras to install the cameras I can't keep doing this.They have agreed to send me a coupon code and communicate with Amazon home and they will send somebody outwell I'm very appreciative that they are doing this I am so frustrated with this camera. At this point I would not recommend that camera for all the money in the world now the other ring products that I have I think they're awesome. So I will update as time goes on if this can't be resolved then I'm going to send that camera back because it's worthless to me. so I dropped my review from a 5 to a 2 at this point and we'll see what happens
I had a ring stick cam solar and a ring doorbell two wired installed last Saturday. The video is awesome the motion detection is excellent not going to lie and say I don't get some false rings but that's okay it's not a lot. What I really like is the ability with both the stick cam and the doorbell to speak to somebody who's at my door. Excellent sound excellent quality of each item. I would highly recommend and as a result of this installation I am going to do the security system for the inside of my house. I have a wired camera system for my exterior I feel ring is just as awesome as those cameras. If anything changes I will update this review.",positive
18,Camera & Photo Products,"All-new Ring Stick Up Cam HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa",$79.99 - $199.97,4," Update 30OCT (original review and first update follow this): I changed my recommendation opinion and recommend the camera now. It doesn’t have the best FOV so the motion detection isn’t the best, but if you utilize the camera to the best of it’s abilities (i.e. don’t try to use the camera mounted high to cover large swaths or property but rather keep it at ~7ft to cover your back porch or something) it does a decent job. It’s a cheaper camera compared to Arlo or some of the other Ring models so you should manage your expectations of it’s performance.

The WiFi signal strength has been sufficient. I initially thought I may have a problem but they seem to be working fine. That’s not to say that a Chime Pro wouldn’t help since I’m on the lower end for signal strength.

What I absolutely love about this camera is the customer support that comes with it. After my initial poor review, Ring customer support reached out to me in an effort to help and to pass feedback on to the design team. The representative that called me was professional, competent, and effective. My specific camera may have an issue, but they are ready to swap it out if none of the solutions work. Components can fail at any point, but as long as the customer support still backs it up, I still consider it a good product.

The solution the tech representative suggested was to perform a factory reset by holding down the setup button for 30 seconds with the battery in. Then, set up the camera as you did before. There's no need to remove the old camera from the app since it will get over-written after the factory reset. He mentioned that he's observed the freezing problem with this model, but so far the factory reset has solved it. It's a simple process that takes a few minutes so if you are having similar problems, I suggest you do this.

The tech rep even followed up to see how the cameras were doing after the factory reset, so like I already stated, the customer support is top notch.

Bottom line is that it’s a cheaper camera so don’t expect it to perform like the spot or floodlight models. However, it still performs sufficiently in proper use cases and has good video quality. The customer support is top notch and is what ultimately made me change my mind to recommend this camera.

Update 28OCT: I’ve upgraded the review to three since the motion detection has improved from the first few days and the fogginess was from an especially wet day. However, one of the cameras stopped working and now fails to detect anything, turn on with linked devices, or give any notifications. I’ve removed the camera and tried to reinstall it several times but it ends up in an endless “updating its software” loop. I’ve waited about 20-30 minutes for it to finish but it doesn’t. I can’t access the camera or any of its features until this “update” process finishes, which it won’t, unfortunately. It seems like I have a bad camera. Their support has reached out to me, which I appreciate, and I’m curious to what they are going to say.

I initially thought the motion detection was horrible but I consider it average now. It has a much narrower FOV than a lot of the other Ring or Arlo cameras. However, it’s a much cheaper camera than these alternatives but you get what you pay for. I’m not sure if it’s worth the money, though. I have a pair of other cameras I just purchased that I’m going to try out and return these if they perform well.

Original Review:
I can not recommend this product, primarily because the motion sensing is bad. I’ve been testing two of these cameras the past 2 days in both day and night conditions and they work maybe 10% of the time. If you watch the video I’m including, I walk directly up to the camera, wave my hands, and absolutely nothing happens. I have daylight videos showing the same thing but I can only post one video per review.

Another problem I noticed is that the cameras have bad WiFi antennas. I placed the cameras in the same location of the Arlo cameras I’m trying to replace and the Ring cameras are having a connection problems where the Arlo ones were perfectly fine. Yes, I could add a Chime Pro, but that’s another $50 expense that could be better spent on a more expensive Arlo camera.

The cameras fogged over completely in the morning, but I live in Washington, which is incredibly wet. The Arlo cameras fared much better but they still had some fog issues.

I did like the integration it has with my other Ring products such as the doorbell and alarm system. The video was good as well. However, with the severe motion detection and WiFi problems, I can not recommend this product. I’m going to give it another few days and probably switch back to Arlo.",positive

20,Camera & Photo Products,Kasa Smart Smart Home Security Camera with Night Vision,$34.99 - $61.99,4,"I really want to give this camera 5 stars. For the price, I probably should. However one of the features I would like to use is currently broken, and the manufacturer seems to be aware of it, but isn't fixing it. The feature in question allows you to tell the camera to ""ignore"" motion outside of a set area, so you don't get alerts for things you don't care about. I really really wish they would fix this, as it would cut down on the number of motion alerts, and make sifting through footage much easier in the event that I need to.

That said, let's move on to the good! First, this camera is extremely simple to set up. You can program it to patrol between up to four different points, and set how long it remains at each one. It also rotates almost 360 degrees, so you can get a LOT of coverage from one unit.

Another feature I like is motion tracking. If it detects motion, it can follow that motion. This is useful for me as I have it under an awning (I know, it's not an outdoor camera, but for the price I'll take the chance), and it covers my entire front yard and about a third of my back yard. If someone enters, it will follow them as long as they remain, which gives me a much better chance of identifying them!

Also, the way it follows motion is kind of nice. It doesn't center it in frame constantly, but in short little motions. From the outside, it looks a bit clumsy, which I think is a good thing. It doesn't look like some robot is following you, but some human crudely working the controls. It definitely gives the impression of being watched, and so I left the status lights on, as I'd prefer to deter any vandals instead of hoping I get a good shot of them after they spray their paint.

As others have pointed out, you can slap an SD card in, and have 24/7 recording. There is NO subscription required for this feature, which is awesome. It highlights with green on the timeline anywhere it sees motion, and purple anytime it sees what it thinks is a person. This is where I really wish the activity zone features worked, as it picks up cars driving by all the time. It also identifies them as people sometimes, but oh well. I'd prefer to only log activity in my yard, and if they ever fix that broken feature I'll edit this review with 5 stars.

Video quality is as advertised, and the pan and tilt is smooth enough that you don't get a bunch of blur when it follows people. The sound quality is mediocre, but that may be because I have it mounted so high up. Really if they ever fix the activity zones I'll probably buy another, however the one I have covers everything I need to, so I'll stay with one for now.",positive
21,Camera & Photo Products,Kasa Smart Smart Home Security Camera with Night Vision,$34.99 - $61.99,5,"Lots of choice in Wi-Fi cameras these days but all things being equal among them, this one has on-board recording to micro-SD. That in itself makes this camera the hands-down best choice. Sure, TP-Link offers a cloud recording subscription, but why pay when you have local recording?

I already own several of the earlier models and upgraded to this 2K model with impressive video quality. Since there is no zoom function make sure everything you need to see is in the frame. In that case the video is hard to beat, day or night.

The pan/tilt function is fantastic and another reason you should not consider a fixed camera. There are four presets for the camera that allow instant moves to different camera angles. You can literally do with one of these cameras what you may need 4 other fixed cameras to accomplish.

The motion detection feature allows you to draw the action area for each of the camera angles, so you minimize false triggering. Plus, it senses people and tells you so. That little bit of AI is immensely useful for security as it identifies people and not just motion that can be triggered by light shifts or passing vehicles.

My cameras are set for 24 hour recording so I can go back at any time and see what was going on. Detected events are easy to find in the timeline but you can also see what was happening long before and after the event. Brilliant.

I was tempted to knock off a star for a couple of issues. 1) The onboard recording function stopped working. I suspected an OTA firmware update broke the feature, and tech support was practically useless. Just as I prepared to send all my cameras back (after a couple of months of this) the feature started working again.

And 2) The app is slow to load the camera views sometimes for no apparent reason. Same home, same Wi-Fi, same cameras, but sometimes it can take 30+ seconds or even a reboot to get the app to display the cameras. Bit of a hassle, that may be fixable but not a deal breaker.

The best part of these cameras is that they are so inexpensive that one wouldn’t mind replacing one if it proved defective. That was my thinking when I mounted two outdoors to watch the exterior of my home. While they are sheltered from direct rain, they are fully exposed to temperatures and humidity of the environment. A year in, both are working flawlessly. Not recommended by the manufacturer but it works for me.

I forgot to mention the auto tracking feature; the camera can follow a person or vehicle (or pet) automatically. My driveway camera is set that way and automatically keeps any moving object in frame. Remember, these cameras are under forty bucks, and do all of this with onboard recording. Why buy anyone else’s camera?",positive

Sometimes when you hold the button to talk through the microphone, it doesn’t go through so you have to repeat yourself but that’s nothing to worry about. It was funny at first to see my dog get confused when he hears my voice and I’m not there.

You can use your 5G or LTE to see the camera live. One thing I noticed about this product is if you do not have wifi, you can’t rotate the camera/ move it to specific areas you want (this happened in my case). If you do however have wifi at your location you can rotate the camera, which is great. I went out of town for the weekend and was able to rotate the camera because I was able to connect to wifi. I was also able talk through the microphone easily with and without wifi (used my LTE).

You need to buy an SD and purchase a Kasa care plan to be able to save activity detection record's, personally I did not buy any of that but I recommend getting it if you are unable to check your phone a lot. It does send lots of notifications about detections so if you do not like that, there is an option to change the notifications. Highly recommended this camera, the app is easy to use. The instructions are straightforward and the product itself is not too expensive.",positive
23,Camera & Photo Products,Kasa Smart Smart Home Security Camera with Night Vision,$34.99 - $61.99,4,"I bought this to check in on my cats when I’m out for extended periods of time. It took me about 2 hours to figure out how to set it up, as I couldn’t get it to connect to my local network. This ended up being user error, not a product problem but my experience with customer support wasn’t great. Granted, it is a Sunday, I had to wait about 45 mins for someone to respond to me via chat and by that point I had finally reached someone via phone. After getting all of my personal info, she asked if this was my first time setting up a device (which it was) and proceeded to tell me she was going to send me a step-by-step instruction video. She didn’t ask any specifics and did not offer to help me any further. Total time spent with customer support was about 2 hours and I never even ended up receiving the video… or support. After some googling, I figured out what I was doing wrong and then it only took me about 10 mins to finishing setting up. Overall, I’m quite impressed with the quality of the product for its price point. I considered a Blink camera but ultimately chose this one for its ability to pan and rotate, which allows me to see different areas of my apartment. There is a talk feature as well. I’m excited to test it out when it is dark. Would recommend.",positive
24,Camera & Photo Products,Kasa Smart Smart Home Security Camera with Night Vision,$34.99 - $61.99,5,"Pleasantly surprised by this camera. The video quality is actually pretty good on 720p and amazing on 2k.
Good sound quality on the speaker. Mic works very well. Pan and tilt function works as expected. I have the camera on a shelf rather than attached to the ceiling so had to flip the view in the app in order to see right side up.
The biggest issue I had was the camera would not connect to mobile data to view remotely. Contacted technical support who steered me to the section where I could adjust the settings and it connected right afterwards. With this camera you can view live feed while away from home which is why I purchased this camera.
Definitely worth the price I paid.

Update: Uprated to 5 stars. Now that I'm familiar with the app I find that the camera is definitely worth the price I paid to be able to monitor my home while away. So much so, I purchased the 1080p model. It's not the 2k camera but it sure works well and the picture is sharp! Absolutely love these cameras! The only weird thing is, not that it affects the camera at all, when using the mic on the app, the 2K model you can press andvlet go of the mic symbol to activate the talk feature, then press and let got to deactivate the mic. On the 1080p model, you have to hold the mic button while talking. Plus, the app beeps when ever you press or let go of the button, kind of like the Roger beep on a two way radio. And there is no setting to reconfigure this function from what I can tell. It's a little annoying but I can get past it.
Overall, I am glad I purchased these cameras. They give me the comfort of being able to check up on my home while I'm away.
I'm picking up a couple more cameras so I can have full coverage of my home.
Stil highly recommend these Kasa cameras.",positive

There’s a 1 to 2 second lag between facts and the video.
Notifications can take minutes to arrive (for my tests)

As a baby monitor, I’m not convinced though: push notifications are definitively slower than a standard baby monitor would be. Also I can’t just leave my phone open at all times to just listen and be reassured … so I might still buy a baby monitor",positive

It has a 360 pan camera that can be controlled from anywhere using a smart phone.
I found the two way audio very helpful. The scheduled option you can set up a daily, weekly on & off times. It has a power button on app that allows you to drop in unexpectedly or if you forgot to set up.

The only thing is, when it is set to 2k, it takes a little longer to access on the app. But other than that, it's a 2k, pan/tilt with 360. It's got motion detection and will follow the motion. It detects people vs other things. It was very easy to set up. Easier than any other cameras I've had. I'm really impressed, especially for the price.

29,Camera & Photo Products,Kasa Smart Smart Home Security Camera with Night Vision,$34.99 - $61.99,4,"The security camera works great for the price and the app does not require you to use their cloud service to use the camera. It also lets you record in 360p, 720p, or 1080p and has different motion/audio settings for detection.

A few gripes I have of it are:
- The camera does not have a full 360 degrees of motion. So it cannot spin in circles but has to loop all the way back to get to the other side.
- There is quite a large delay (~0.5 seconds) between manually moving the camera with app controls and the camera moving.
- The night vision works and looks great, but the lights for night vision are all pretty bright. This makes the camera noticeable in the dark and any sort of reflective surface (ie windows) can become blindly bright in the video.",positive

I purchased a SD card to go with it to record any events while we were away. I like that you can use the camera without purchasing an online monthly subscription account. I dislike the fact that you can't adjust it to record longer than the set time limit without an online monthly subscription account. I like that you can set up several cameras on one account and share with family so they can also monitor them. I was not happy that the camera quit recognizing the SD card while we were away which also limited our view of the area we purchased the camera to monitor. It has done this twice
& I removed the sd card and reinserted it and it recognizes the sd card again. The picture & sound quality are good & you can set the sensitivity for movement & sound detection separately which is nice. You can view live stream online through the app and even talk through the camera to someone & hear them when they reply. It also allows you to set off an alarm sound in live view through the app if needed. You can also have it track movement or not. This can be a little glichy. I have ours installed upside down so I can see three different locations and it loses me going from one room to the next more often than not. Installing upside down was a nice feature though as you can set it to rotate the image so it appears correctly when viewing it online. You can also set it up to not record during set times. When I turn it off from the app, however, it will still push notifications to me every few hours saying it went offline which is a little confusing. I have to unplug it if I want to leave it off for any length of time in order to not continue to receive notifications. It also moves around while off (but screen stays covered) before it pushes a notification telling you it went offline when I have it turned off in the app (?). Another dislike, I have an outdoor camera by another manufacturer that I am able to format the sd card on remotely, without removing it from the camera, which this camera doesn't do. Overall, I am happy with this little camera and the piece of mind it provided while we were away. Now home, I'll be able to use it whenever I go out to keep an eye on the dogs to be sure they are watching the house. 😃",positive

The cameras are small and easy to set up. Once you get them positioned and hooked up to the wifi you simply downioad the blurams app and voila you can view whatever your camera sees! We have one camera in our living room area and one in the bedroom. The cameras generally do a pretty good job of detecting motion when the dog moves from room to room etc. The big concern I have encountered so far is that one day my husband and i both were locked out of the app, even though we had our password saved on our phones. This immediately raised a warning flag for me that someone may have hacked into the account potentially allowing them to see into our home. I changed the password immediately and have not had any further issue with the password BUT I have noticed on 2 separate occasions now that the bedroom camera will turn on (there is a light that turns on and off when the camera is/isn't in use) randomly. Again, this causes me obvious concerns about the security of a wifi camera. For now, we keep the cameras unplugged when we're home and we will be looking into another camera system as a potential replacement.",positive

It has ads unless you pay for a subscription even though you already paid for the camera, and the notifications have a delay of up to 30 seconds. Also, I frequently have to close the app and reopen when I go to view the room because otherwise it will say it's loading indefinitely. Aside from those complaints, though, it's a very functional camera at a good price.

The real test came when we went out of town and stayed at an Airbnb, I hooked it back up, connected to the Airbnb’s internet and we went out, to my horror we didn’t have reception on our phones but the unit sent me snapshots every time the puppy moved or made a noise, so we could still see what he was doing, which was sleeping, rolling over, chewing on a stuffed Kong, and sleep some more !
It gave us great peace of mind, we could safely leave him for short periods and still be able to monitor him.
So why not 5-Stars ? There’s no “off switch” so I have to unplug it when not in use which is not a big deal but a few times when plugged back in it’ll make you go through a few steps to get it up and running again, then it’ll do a room scan and you’ll have to point / adjust it into the correct position, it would be easier to be able to flip an on/off switch.
I love this monitor, the picture is clear, you could talk to your pet (which I haven’t done yet) and we take it on all our trips, no problems ever !
Would be great to watch over an elderly loved one too

She chose these as the most comfortable, the lightest, and the easiest and quickest to adjust. I tried them all and agreed that although these were a fraction of the cost, they are the most comfortable to use.

Of course, depending on where you put it, you likely won't be able to get a full image of your place, but I'm sure you could try different angles or mount it somewhere if that's what you're looking to do! I will say that there were a handful of times where it tracked shadows from my ceiling fan, but not from my cat, so that's just something to keep in mind in terms of its sensitivity.

In terms of the app usability, I didn't find it too complicated, although I never really figured out how to customize the alerts so that my phone wasn't constantly getting notifications from every detected movement. I ended up turning the notifications off since I didn't need them either way. I had the month-long trial of cam plus which was nice for keeping mini recordings of my cat throughout the day. I would advise that you do NOT buy the bundle with the cam plus code as it's not immediately clear that you need to wait to use it AFTER your trial is over, otherwise it just disappears.

• Records event clips when motion is detected, which my boyfriend is extra excited about now that he has a bunch of clips of me singing, rapping, and dancing around while cleaning
• Great quality and volume enables me to tell my dog to get off the table or yell at my boyfriend to wake up off the couch and do some laundry or something. No more avoiding my calls or texts on his day off, no mercy!
• Great customer support and warranty! When my derpy idiot dog knocked the camera down 4 days after we got it, the image turned magenta. A simple chat with support via the phone app resulted in Wyze Cam sending a new unit, free of charge!

62,Camera & Photo Products,Parent ASIN for Stick Up Cam Plug-in,$79.99 - $199.97,5,"4/8/20 Update:
This is the final update. The firmware upgrade resolved my issues. It is working fine. So I upgraded my review to 5 stars. Here is the bulleted summary. The original review, and the previous update, appear below unedited.
* Excellent support. They reached out to me to help me when they saw my original review. Had that not happened, I would have just sent this back.
* You cannot flip the video if you mount this upside down (like hanging it below a roof overhang, for example). It must be mounted right side up. I don’t know why, as the indoor cameras can be mounted either way.
* The integration with other ring cameras in the app is excellent. The upgrades to the app that occurred recently allow one to set “modes” and enable or disarm various cameras in various situations. Handy.
* Unlike the indoor cameras, this outdoor camera has limited control over motion detection zones. You can activate three different set zones, but you cannot draw a region like you can with the indoor camera. The motion detection works fine, but I’d rather be able to activate a particular area as opposed to picking from set regions.
* The firmware upgrade was problematic, and was the source of the issues I had. I don’t know why, but with the support help I got, it updated fine and resolved my issues. If you get one of these, and when you install it tells you it needs a firmware upgrade, make sure that happens. You can ensure it does by seeing the blue light on the front flash on and off after you set it up (and the update starts). Despite repeated attempts on my end, that did not happen until I was on the phone with support. The update does take a while, so be patient. But if the blue light is not flashing, try power cycling the camera until it does.

Bottom line: recommended.

4/6/20 Update: This is an update to my previous review. This is still a work in progress, but progress has been made. I increased my rating to 3 stars, but will revise it again after I am done testing. After posting my original review (below, unchanged), a Ring support person saw it and emailed me. Which I did not expect. We arranged a call, and he helped me get the software update applied (which, for some reason, was never properly applied). This appeared to clear the issues. I had moved the camera indoors (to eliminate any network issues on my end) and tested it all weekend, and had nothing but problems. I convinced myself through that testing that the camera was defective and figured I would return it for a replacement. However, now that the software update was applied, it seems to be working fine. I moved it back to its outdoor location (which weakens the wifi signal) and am testing it now. Hopefully this solved the problem. However, kudos to the Ring support to help with this. They reached out to me and the person I spoke with was quite knowledgeable. Very helpful. I am confident at this point that, if this camera does turn out to be defective, that a replacement will work fine. Hopefully this problem is solved for good, though. I will update this further after more testing.

The original review appears below, unedited.
---
This camera (the stick up outdoor camera, powered by plug in) was completely useless. I have three other indoor ring cameras which all work fine. This one was flaky from setup. Like my other cameras, it setup easily with the app. I connected it and set it up indoors initially (the installation was to be outside). Once connected, it immediately wanted to do an update. Fine. I wait. No flashing lights, nothing. I wait and wait. After a lengthy period of time, I decided it was done. I continued through the setup and did a live view. It was very sluggish, but it worked. I figured, cool, it’s ready. So I unplugged it and went outside with an extension cord, plugged it back in, and started fooling around with location while using live view. Was working fine (however, it was here where I discovered there is no video inversion for this particular model if you want to hang it upside down - this is not true for the indoor stickup cameras, so beware of that). I leave it plugged in and sitting out side, and I return indoors to get something (I actually went inside to confirm via the internet that, yes, this camera really cannot be mounted upside down). I go back outside and try to reconnect to live view and it refuses. Claims poor connection. Complains about my phone, complains about the camera. Nothing changed. Not even the location. I had just spent several minutes up and down a ladder and screwing around with placement, all with live view. No problem. I finally decide to just remove the device and re-install it. So I do (this time depressing the button inside to put the camera in setup mode). I eventually get the same message, in the same place in the installation process, about needing an update. So I do the same thing again. This time I am doing all of this outside, because that’s where everything is now. Eventually, after (I think) the update is complete (it’s not like it tells you) I try live view. Doesn’t work. Well, it sort of worked. It worked initially, then when I tried to go back to it, it would not reconnect again complaining about a poor connection. I finally decide to try this one more time. I delete it again, move it all inside to sit right next to the wifi access point. I redo the install again (delete the device, put the camera in setup mode, re-install as before). I again get the need to update message. This time I just let it sit there for a good 20 minutes so to make sure it installed the update (or thought it did). So here I am typing this, with the camera sitting on my desk. It is in live view but constantly stops, complains about a poor connection, and so on. When I pop in and out of live view, it takes quite a while to reconnect. All of my other cameras are nearly instant. But not this one. All on the same network. The upshot? I have no idea if I just happen to have a lemon here or what, but this thing is useless. It won’t even work 4 ft from the wifi access hotspot. I can literally see it from where I am sitting. Every other device I have works fine, including other devices connected and sitting outside (an older security camera, a weather station, .... - all connected to the same network, the same wifi access hotspot). I am returning this today. Very disappointed since the other indoor ring cameras work so well.",positive
63,Camera & Photo Products,Parent ASIN for Stick Up Cam Plug-in,$79.99 - $199.97,4,Installation instructions are horrible and printed in a light grey ink. Too much is overlooked/missed by an assumption that you (the self installer) knows the product fully beforehand. Not written for a first timer. Mounted this with the optional ceiling/overhead mount over a detached garage (should have been included). Too far away to get a strong enough Wi-Fi signal from the house yet. Trying to move the router closer to the camera. They don’t mention this signal distance issue nor offer any troubleshooting tip suggestions. Assumptions again that your installation scenario is based on a fully high quality techno place. Nice that it can be part of a system that can be added too simply. Not mentioned forthright though is the point that to record any images you need their subscription service which is based on each device you want to record.,positive
64,Camera & Photo Products,Parent ASIN for Stick Up Cam Plug-in,$79.99 - $199.97,4,"Seems to be a pretty nice camera with a few limitations. Motion detection is different between daytime / lighted conditions and night time with IR. The IR lit areas seem to be less motion sensitive than in the daytime. Considering this is not a professional security system camera it does fine. One thing I wish Ring would add is a time control or ""Home vs Away"" to the ""Motion Warning"" where it announces that you are being recorded. It would be nice to have the announcement at different times and situations. If I'm home or it's during the day, it's not needed, but at night or if I'm gone I would like to have it without changing it in the app for each camera each time. But I like them well enough that I have bought four of them so far. 😁",positive
65,Camera & Photo Products,Parent ASIN for Stick Up Cam Plug-in,$79.99 - $199.97,3,"I don't usually write reviews but this product could be much better and install much easier with a few tweeks.
The Cons:
1) the mount for the outside is totally useless unless you have wooden clad boards. Even then i wouldn't use it. If you are mounting to cinderblock or vinyl siding either be prepared to build something or buy a bracket. Don't put your tools or ladder away too soon ;-) You're going to need a bunch of tools.
2) if you have to turn the camera upside down to mount it the software doesn't rotate the picture for you. This problem was solved on most applications 10 yrs ago. it would have been nice if this had been mentioned in the directions. Oh wait see #4 below
3) The seal around electrical input is poor.
4) the directions were written by someone who never actually installed one outside. Read them very carefully. Read them all the way through. Shake your head in wonder and repeat. For an outdoor install, you start on the last section and work forward MOL.
5) interestingly you have to install the program, then install the cameras, then purchase the subscription. If you try to purchase the subscription first you will get stuck in an endless loop of logins if you are trying to do it from a secure connection desktop.
6) If you travel and your phone will not work in your travel destination you will need third-party authentification software. It took me 40 minutes on the phone to finally get an answer to this question.

Pros:
1) I'm impressed with the picture quality.
2) The phone app is simple to use, though the desktop browser site needs fewer ads.
3) I'm impressed with the ease of use once it is set up in both places. Note #2 in Cons.
4) 100$/yr to view my house from Honduras, Thailand, the Philippines, Mexico ... is a steal IMO compared to a security service.
5) I like the fact that you can ""blackout"" zones. My safe and computer screen are blacked out in my office. The street outside my fence is blacked out.

Lastly and this isn't Ring's fault I don't think. They sell a solar panel w/ outside camera for a discounted price. The solar panel showed up in a day. The camera won't be here until September. If i had bought them separately I'd already have both? HUH?",fair

70,Camera & Photo Products,Parent ASIN for Stick Up Cam Plug-in,$79.99 - $199.97,5,"I got a pair of cameras and mounted them in front of my garage, perhaps 25 feet from my WiFi router. Couldn't get them to connect to the router at all. I was able to put my phone near the cameras in airplane mode and then connect to the router without an issue. It even claimed to have a full three rings of signal, but I'm not sure how meaningful that is. I bought a Chime Pro repeater to help boost the signal that I originally installed about half way between the cameras and the router. That was good enough for an intermittent connection, but to get a reliable connection I had to get an extension cord and move the Chime Pro to the other side of the wall where the cameras are mounted. Now that it's only about 6 feet away from the cameras (closer than the power warts that are separated from the cameras by an 8 foot power cords, so I'm I'm sure I have the distance right) everything finally works reliably. But a WiFi range of 6 feet seems incredibly short even when that 6 feet includes an exterior wood frame wall.

The motion detection isn't remotely as nice as the Ring doorbell. The camera has three zones (left, center, right) that can be individually turned on or off, rather than the user drawn polygon of activity in the doorbell. Even with ""motion verification"" turned on, one of the cameras is constantly triggered by blowing leaves that appear in all three of the available zones. So I turned off alarms for this camera and now I get lots of nice videos of blowing leaves and the occasional car or person in that part of the driveway. Fortunately I was able to adjust the other camera so that it had a useful motion zone with many fewer leaves that only rarely trigger the camera.

After I posted the above review an agent from Ring contacted me to discuss the situation further. She asured me that an RSSI of about -60 dB is acceptable, and I don't disagree - the camera works at this signal strength. We talked about the relationship between the different components and she suggested trying other placements of the Chime Pro. After asking for permission to look at my devices she also pointed out that I have two Chime Pros and only one of them is being used as a WiFi repeater. She offered to swap the newer one (only a couple of weeks old) for a simple Chime and give me a credit for the difference. I took her up on the offer.

After the call ended, I also moved the Chime Pro to a different location. It's now further from both the access point (downstairs instead of in the next room) and the cameras (15 feet away versus 5 feet away) than it used to be, The RSSI reported by the Chime Pro is a bit worse (no surprise) but still very good. The RSSI reported by the cameras, however, improved by about 15 dB. I'm now wondering what's inside that (uninsulated) space inside the eave that separated the previous Chime Pro location and the cameras. But I'm also happy with the result.

Another update to the review. Several days ago Ring updated the firmware for plug in cameras (not battery powered cameras0 that provides the same motion zone capabilities that the Ring doorbell has. This is a big improvement over the original three zones and makes it easy to avoid motion from false triggers, such as tree leaves, that might otherwise trigger the camera. Once I pulled out a ladder so that I could reach the cameras installing the update and updating the settings to take advantage of the new capability was easy.",positive

The overall verdict: this works great.

For full disclosure, I'm a physician, but not an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist, and I am not giving a recommendation for this product as a physician, just as a regular user.

Here's the conundrum:

1. Cotton swabs, as used by most people, are not recommended by Otorhinolaryngologists (Ear, Nose, and Throat) specialists and other physicians because most people just jam cerumen (ear wax) deeper into the external auditory canal. People generally have at least one of two types of ear wax: wet and dry. The wet type gets jammed deeper into the canal by swabs, and swabs don't usually have a good enough grasp on the dry kind. The problem is with both technique and technology here.

2. When I was a child, my (Asian) parents used small metal spoons (sold for the purpose of ear cleaning) to clear out ear wax. I have no idea how they convinced me to allow them to stick a thin metal spoon into my ears, but somehow they did (at least, when I was an older child). I can't imagine doing that with my hyperkinetic, four-nager at this time. The spoons were used to gently scrape ear wax off the sides of the canal. Because they're small, they are less likely to impact/jam the ear wax deeper into the canal. However, because of the curve of the canal and high degree of sensitivity of the inner part of the external auditory canal, it's hard to clear out the wax without causing some discomfort while blindly scraping the sides. One might have a fear of accidentally pushing the spoon in too far and scraping or injuring the ear drum itself. These are available online, and I purchased some on Amazon to clean my own ears. It's a doable but challenging process. Again, this requires good fine motor skill and technique; the technology is only marginally better than cotton swabs.

This endoscopic product mimics those ear spoons, but it adds a small Bluetooth-enabled camera, allowing you to advance the spoon while watching your progress on the screen. Like with any medical procedure that can be done blind (without imaging guidance) or with imaging guidance, the task is so much easier, so much more accurate, and so much more comfortable when you can see what you are doing. The image quality, illumination, and frame rate is surprisingly good. I cannot speak to the longevity of the product yet, but I am hopefully that I will be able to use it well for years to come.",positive

Do no introduce stuff in your ear canals (including cotton swabs, aka cue tips)

That out of the way, this product is amazing and picture quality is great. I bought this because my wife is always telling me about she not hearing well from the right ear, and how it sound muffled.

My wife was checking another product worth more than a hundred dollar… do not buy another product thinking the quality will be better. THIS IS ALL YOU WILL NEED.

I was able to remove a huge chunk of ear wax debri that was stuck to my wife’s right tympanic membrane, it was painful, I had to buy debrox drops to soften it a bit, not that much, but it worked.

My hearing was 90% gone and no home remedy was helping. I had waited longer than I should’ve to do something about it and as a result may have almost required a professional. The video shown was after about a half hour after starting to excavate my ear canal and it was still very bad.

I could not see my eardrum for most all of this process, due to the extent of my blockage, which very badly concerned me having read reviews of punctured ear drums. What helped for me to feel more comfortable was using my other ear (which had no blockage) as an example of how far the tool could go in before being right at my eardrum. We used a sharpie pen and marked the point at which the tool was uncomfortably close to my eardrum and used that same marker on the other side to help me keep a safe distance while removing the wax. It was necessary to go later by layer over a 2 hour period using 3% peroxide in my ear for 5 minutes at a time and removing the softened layer after each soak. This was extremely necessary due to the wax being so dense that it was being pushed further into my ear if not softened adequately enough prior to attempting extraction. I’m an very relieved to say that ALL of the wax shown in that video was removed from my ear with this tool and I can now hear crystal clear again for the first time in around 6 months of progressive loss of hearing in the affected ear. I have attached a picture of the final product. I will be removing the remaining wax with peroxide and leaving it at that. It is necessary to have SOME wax in your head to prevent infections and keep foreign object from reaching your eardrum easily.

I cannot recommended PATIENCE enough here, this tool is very very good but also very VERY dangerous if used haphazardly. PLEASE, please be very cautious and aware of the dangers of shoving foreign object inside of your ear outside of professional supervision. There is no coming back from an injury to your eardrum to 100%, ever.

All of this to say, this tool really works! The tip is very soft so it doesn’t irritate the sensitive skin in the inner ear as much as some of these hard plastic alternatives would have. If you’re ready to take the precautionary steps to operate this tool with care, then it will pay for itself 10x in utility and quality of life improvement.",positive

I set up another small camera but the person even stole that. We are fairly certain it is the cleaning crew but I set up one to catch them as they decline to replace the janitor we have without proof.

This camera was unobtrusive enough to go unnoticed, only bad thing is I set it for motion as it is supposed to record 3 five minute videos once the camera is tripped (per instruction manual). In fact most recordings are only about 4-430 in total time and it most certainly doesn’t record more than one at a time.

Oddly enough I got the person to trip it when they came in (fairly certain it’s the cleaning crew) however since the person was more than 5 feet from the camera I could only see up to about knee/thigh height max. Then it cuts off as the person is perusing items on my desk, and only kicks on again after they are leaving and trip the motion again.

If the camera doesn’t do 3 five minute videos make sure to update your instruction manuals. As for now I bought a larger video card and will leave it on continuous loop to see if I have better luck.",positive

The description indicates a 32gb MicroSD card size, so I purchased a top of the line 32gb Sandisk high speed card to go with it initially. I was disappointed to find that the unfrosted / clear lens LED T8 conversion tube lamps and ceiling fan in the shop apparently set off the motion sensor option continuously (from what I can tell), forcing me to record in continuous / loop mode whether I wanted to or not (no matter where the little micro switch was set)(loop or motion). This initially yielded poor results, as 3 hours of video recording capacity before overwrite was woefully inadequate (missed a lot of what I needed to see). I took a chance on purchasing a higher capacity 128gb Sandisk card, and son of a gun it worked! I really expected that it would not, but was very pleasantly surprised that it did. Had I known, I would have just initially purchased the 256Gb card and been done...

The 32gb MicroSD card = 3~ hours continuous (recording before it starts overwriting the video clips)

The 128gb card I tried next = 12~ hours continuous recording before overwrite

Then moved up further still to 256gb = 24~ hours continuous recording before overwrite

From what I have observed, you must have the ability to format the higher capacity MicroSD cards using the older FAT32 format. They are usually delivered with the modern exFAT format these days (so it won't work if just put in without this step). This may not be possible for the average user, as most modern computers want to format it using the newer exFAT which did not work for me. I used the EaseUS Partition Master Program that I have to format them into FAT32 = success. The AVI video clips it creates are in 5 min sequential segments. The file size of a 5 minute clip averages a whopping 700-800mb! If this device used a MP4 video codec or similar, the compression would have saved a massive amount of memory space, but the AVI format is very universal and will play on most all computers... If you connect it to a USB cord, it plays the videos just fine on my various PC's (you must unplug it from the wall socket to view the stored videos). If you try to download all the files from the device through a USB cord connected to your PC, go mow your lawn or something, as it takes a LONG time to transfer the files this way (tested on USB 2.0 and 3.0 - no difference, so the bottleneck must be in the device itself. Pulling the MicroSD chip out and plugging it directly into the PC made transferring files a VASTLY faster task, BUT this would mean that you would have to either leave the sticker that hides the installed SD card off so that you could remove the chip constantly (risking visual detection of it not being a generic USB charger under close scrutiny), or quickly wear out the 3 stickers provided constantly trying to peel them off and putting them back on (not easy as they are inset). Only downloading one 5 minute video clip from the batch it creates onto your PC wouldn't take too long if that's all you perhaps needed. My needs require a whole day's worth of clips, so I have gone so far as to install (an expensive) 14TB hard drive into my PC to store multiple days worth of employee behaviors.

Soooo.... I accomplished my objective - I caught my employees red handed without having to install a full on CCTV system. Further Note: This gizmo has their white eagle company logo on the bottom of it that won't come off with acetone or any similar strong solvent tested. I carefully masked it off and hit it with some gloss black spray paint - no more questionable logo. The little tiny camera eye simply looks like a LED that would light up to indicate a fully charged device. To set the on screen video time stamp, you have to connect it to the PC and modify the text file to the correct time and date. The little battery inside holds this in its memory when unplugged.

Summary? It works! Installing a 256GB MicroSD card, and hitting the bottom with some black spray paint did it! Nobody can tell this thing is a hidden camera, and it is quite the adventure to see what people do when they think no one is looking. I hope my feedback helps!",positive

I have used it plugged into a 2-year-old 5200 milliamp battery pack (originally used to keep my iPhone charged), and with a full charge the camera operated for about 23 hours nonstop. I haven't tried using it as an actual USB charger so I can't talk about that function, but the video recorded by the camera is actually better than I expected -- more than clear enough to easily identify faces, items, etc. The fact that this unit (along with the separately-purchased battery pack & USB cable) is black makes it much easier to ""hide i plain sight"" than would be possible with a white or colored unit, so that's an added plus. Now for those limitations I mentioned..
1) Sometimes having no sound with a video makes it more difficult to figure out what's happening onscreen. This is unavoidable due to legal constraints, but is a fact that should be kept in mind.
2) It's almost impossible to get videos that aren't at least a little crooked; this unit is so light that even just a little twisting of its power cable means it won't lay perfectly flat while in use. Again, a minor thing but worth considering.
3) The power cord plugs in on the same side as the camera lens, so it will block a small portion of what the camera ""sees"" in a downward direction. For good room coverage, you'll want to put this well back from any areas of interest so the cord doesn't block line-of-sight in a downards direction.
4) The first time I used this camera, I had it set back about 3 inches from the edge of the furniture it was sitting on, and it was only a day and a half later that I discovered this blocked the view of anything below the shoulders of anyone in the closer half of the room. You'll need to keep this right on, or just a fraction of an inch back from, the edge of any furniture.
5) The light from a flat-screen TV in an otherwise blacked-out room will give you a so-so image of people & things within a 15-foot radius of the TV. (By ""so-so"" I mean *just* enough light to see larger movement, but you may lose things like individual hand motions to the shadows.) Any less light than that and you'll have an almost totally black frame that even image enhancement can't really save. Someone using a smartphone under such circumstances will show up as a bright spot with a ghostly face floating directly above it, with glare blocking out everything else within a 3-4 foot radius.
6) I'm using an Apple MacBook Pro running MacOS X Catalina (v10.15.7) and the video files created by this camera CANNOT be opened by QuickTime. You'll need some other video viewing software (I downloaded the Elmedia Video Player, but there are several others to choose from).",positive

It is an inexpensive camera so the video quality isn't amazing but worth the price. But certainly has facial recognition at a distance you would expect. It does poorly in low light, but without IR it performs as expected. It doesn't always get recognized as a standard USB. This can be frustrating. Another issue not necessarily a negative for the product but the experience, is that I can through a USB-C adapter and using the charger port on my Samsung S20 see the contents of any Micro-SD card. My phone using VLC for android can view the avi files generated by this camera. However, if I connect the camera to my phone using the adapter or if I remove the Micro-SD card from the camera and use the adapter, it for some reason deletes the VIDEOS folder and it's contents. I am using the safe unmount function. The interesting part is, if I remove the Micro-SD card from the camera and then install the Micro-SD card in the SD card tray in the Samsung S20, I can see and view all off the videos created. The phone does create several android necessary folders on the Micro-SD card but the camera isn't bothered by the folders and continues functioning as expected after reinstallation.

92,Camera & Photo Products,"Adasion 12x42 High Definition Binoculars for Adults with Phone Adapter and Foldable Tripod, Super Bright High Power Binoculars with Large View, Lightweight Binoculars for Bird Watching Hunting Sports",$69.88,5,"The birds, fish, frogs, and turtles in my neighborhood have become my new friends since social distancing began, and these binoculars have been spectacl-ar in helping me identify them. I’d never used binoculars before this new hobby, so here are some things I’ve learned that might be helpful to first-time users:

Binoculars always have two numbers in the spec, AxB. A represents the magnification – the bigger the number, the more zoomed-in the image looks. B represents the size of the objective lens, which is the piece of glass at the far end of the binoculars. The bigger the number, the brighter and clearer the image looks.

They also have a focus wheel that sits between the two halves, which you’ll have to rotate depending on whether you want to focus on something close or super far away. There’s also usually an additional fine tuner on the right eyepiece that will allow you to adjust for differences between your two eyes. So when using a pair of binoculars for the first time, you should close your right eye and use the focus wheel for just your left eye, and then close your left eye and use the fine tuner for your right eye. After that you can just directly use the focus wheel.

I had an old pair of Bushnell 12x25 binoculars at home before I got this Adasion 12x42 set. Here’s a comparison, with things I learned from experience:

1/ Size: The Adasion is bigger because of the larger objective lens. You can see the size difference in my first picture.

2/ Eyepiece: The Adasion has eye cups that rotate in and out, which give your eyes some breathing distance from the eyepiece lenses. You can see in the second picture the right eye cup has been extended while the left one has not. The Bushnell didn’t have this feature, so my eyelashes were always brushing against the glass, and the glass itself would frequently fog up.

3/ Straps: This seems like a trivial one, but it bothered me more than I expected. Bushnell’s straps attach at the center, while Adasion’s straps attach on each side. This results in the Bushnell hanging somewhat perpendicular to my torso, which makes it really annoying as it bounces along while I walk. The Adasion just lies comfortably flush against my torso.

4/ Protective covers: You can see these in the first picture. Each objective lens has an individual rubber cover that hangs off the end. If you don’t like them, you can remove them – they’re attached by a rubber ring that slides off easily. But I think they’re great and protect the glass from smudges. The eyepiece lenses have a joint cover that you take off completely; I only put it back on when I’m done for the day.

5/ Picture quality: The most important difference. You can see four pictures I took through both binoculars. Interestingly, I found that the Bushnell binoculars were very slightly more magnified than the Adasion. I actually prefer the wider field of view of the Adasion, which is more forgiving of unsteady hands. The Bushnell also starts to get blurry on the edges (see the fence and bench or the floating grass in the fish photo), while the Adasion is much clearer throughout. In addition, colors are a lot brighter through the Adasion, while the Bushnell is a bit faded.

This brings me to my last piece of advice: the smartphone adapter is pretty cool. I had no idea what a phone adapter was in the beginning – I assumed it was some kind of USB cable that digitally connected the binoculars to your phone, and you’d have to download an app or something to take pictures. Nope. So apparently, you can just hold up your phone camera to the eyepiece of any binoculars, have your phone “look” through the binoculars (monocular?), and you simply use the camera app to snap whatever your phone sees. It works surprisingly well as an amateur telephoto lens. That’s all I did to take the pictures from the Bushnell.

Turns out though, it’s kind of hard to hold the binoculars in one hand, your phone in the other, and both steady enough while maneuvering your thumb to snap the photo. It’s flat out impossible to take video. So the purpose of this phone adapter is to make it easier by holding your phone in place. It’s a very simple piece of hardware with a spring-loaded clamp around your phone (both an iPhone 6s and iPhone 11 fit just fine) and a round cap that attaches to either of the binoculars’ eye cups. For best results, attach your phone without the eye cups extended. Righty tighty all the way. I find that provides the optimal phone-to-eyepiece distance for the best view from the camera.

I also did some extra research on phone adapters and tried to buy one for my Bushnell. The universal circular ones have a screw cap where the attachment can be expanded or contracted in order to fit any eye cup. But I actually found that the screw mechanism made the attachment so thick that my phone camera was too far away from the eyepiece to see much through it – all I got was a small hole. In contrast, the adapter that comes with the Adasion was built to fit the Adasion eye cups perfectly. It’s a nice snug fit so your phone (even a heavy iPhone 11) will stay in place at just the right distance from the lens and without needing any hand support.

The last thing I’ll say about the phone adapter is not to be surprised that your picture is a circle in a black vignette. That makes sense, since that’s what you see when your eyes look through the binoculars too. The rectangular photos from other reviews can be produced by either zooming using the camera’s zoom function or just cropping after the fact.

Okay that’s as much as I’ve learned so far through my amateur explorations, hope you’ve found it helpful. :)",positive

Liked the idea of the tripod and being able to attach the smartphone to it. Have to save the binoculars themselves seem fine, lightweight, and easy to use. The tripod also seems quite sturdy and easy to use. Had a little problems figuring out how to attach the smartphone with the right camera, but that was more about my smartphone I think. I suspect that unless I'm going to be sitting for a long period of time, I'll end up just hanging binoculars around my neck and also hanging my camera with the long lens on it rather than trying to finagle the smartphone. Especially as, with my smartphone, which is a Samsung Galaxy S10, the picture is kind of small with just a circle and lots of black surrounding that. Of course, it maybe I just need to play around with that more. Wasn't entirely impressed with the instruction book. Particularly with the instructions on putting on the strap. I had to just kind of figure it out for myself with a tiny bit of help from the pictures. Also took me a bit to figure out how to attach the tripod, but that was because I hadn't carefully looked at the picture of all the parts of the binoculars first. So that one's on me. I think they'll be good binoculars. I just don't know that all the bells and whistles are worth it. Also, the case is kind of weird as if I don't try to stuff the tripod and the other attachments into the case the flap pulls down too far and misses the velcro closure. But if I sort of stuff the tripod in, in a not very secure way as there isn't enough room to actually put it in the bag, then the flap matches up with the velcro. Seems a bit of a weird design. I'll probably end up carrying a bag with my camera and throwing the tripod and the other attachments into there and hoping that the flap will stay down on the bag even without the velcro meeting up well. Seems a bit of a design flaw.",positive

A recommendation would be to adapt the case to also comfortably carry the smart phone/tripod adapters. The tripod itself is probably a little too large to include in the case, but perhaps a velcro strap or similar to attach it to the case? It should also be noted, not unexpectedly, that photographing from the smart phone is not something that can just be whipped out and pictures immediately snapped.

I'm lazy. I didn't want to walk all the way to the street unless the mail had arrived. I decided the simplest solution was to get an inexpensive pair of binoculars that would allow me to easily check the little flag.

I wish I could figure out a way to take a snapshot through the binoc's eyepiece so show you the improvement, but alas, I'm not coordinated enough to manage that. Suffice it to say, I'm very, very pleased.

The resolution is crisp & clear, while the color clarity is great. No odd tints or casts.

Following the advice of another reviewer I went with the 8x21 size.

Should you decide to do that please don't be dismayed when you open the package to find a box with markings indicating a 12x52 set inside. Seems like they only have the one kind of box. On one end of the box is a sticker that properly identifies the 8x21 pair inside.

You'll be astounded by how small these things really are. The case is about 1"" thick & roughly the size of a credit card in height. A simple lanyard comes attached as well so they're easy to dangle from your neck as needed.

They do have some issues though. There is noticeable refraction in certain light, but It wouldn’t be reasonable to expect coated lenses at this price. The field of view is fairly narrow, that’s due to the magnification and size of the lenses, but that means there isn’t much room for error if you want the stereoscopic view binoculars can provide. I’m not sure both sides are perfectly parallel because getting them properly adjusted is a bit tricky. I usually don’t bother because I’m just going to fold them up again.

I haven’t experienced any durability issues yet, but I didn’t pay enough to get premium materials or workmanship, so if something does come up I can’t complain.

Additionally the magnification achieved in such a compact design is pretty impressive. Basically I use these in circumstances where it's just not practical or convenient to bring larger binoculars but where I want to have binoculars with me for casual or random use, e.g. on a long hike where something interesting in the distance might be worth viewing with binoculars. Now, as mentioned in some other reviews, the focus ring is a little ""fragile"" and can break. This is where this company distinguishes themselves.

112,Camera & Photo Products,Google Nest Cameras,$98.00 - $698.00,5,"In an attempt to help prospective buyers decide whether the NEST is perfect for them or not, I am hoping to write as detailed a review as I can that addresses some of the biggest concerns about the purchase of this security camera.

Let me quickly say that I never thought of buying a security camera for my home. However, I was offered another brand (Amcrest) at a discount for review purposes. Installed it, and was immediately elated that I could check up on my elderly Mother during the day. However, that security camera was absolute garbage. It lasted a day before it stopped working. I was a bit heartbroken after realizing the benefits of having a camera in the home, and immediately sought for something better.

The Logitech Circle was one of the cameras I considered. However, there were many complaints about its performance, particularly the fact that its cloud recording doesn't particularly do a great job of reporting movement in the room. Many complained that it captured movement after it occurred instead of before, thus causing the viewer to miss the action completely.

Since I am putting the most important aspects of this camera first in my review, I want to address the biggest complaints about the NEST Security Camera: it's price and the cost of a subscription.

No doubt, something needs to be done about the costs related to this product. This is not a $200 camera. It costs NEST less than half that to manufacture. I wouldn't mind paying $200 if not for the fact that there is a $100 yearly subscription required for cloud storage on top of that. There has to be a compromise somewhere. I bought two of these Nest cameras and would have bought 2 more if not for the fact that the cost was prohibitive for me. The folks at NEST need to realize that many customers want to build a home security system with their product, but cannot, because of the combination of pricing.

Your first security camera will cost you $100 per year to monitor. Each additional camera is $50 per year. That adds up very quickly as you add on cameras.

Now mind you, I am all for cloud base subscriptions. I think they are essential. Yes, you could buy a camera with the ability to put a SD card in it and record/monitor activity. However, a smart burglar will steal that camera and the card inside of it, thus losing your ability to review the theft. A cloud service ensures that if your camera is stolen, the recorded activity is secure in the cloud. A thief cannot steal it.

NEST does provide an ample 10-day history of 24/7 recording for its basic $100 per year subscription. You can purchase 30 days of history for (I believe) $300 per year. However, I don't think most people need even 10 days worth of history at their disposal, so I have no complaints about level of storage being offered. Perhaps NEST could offer even a lower subscription price for 5 days of recorded history, which might attract more people to its brand.

Since I am still pointing out the negatives, I might as well also say that this is an indoor camera only. It cannot be placed outdoors. There are enclosure options made by companies like Dropcase (you can search them on Amazon) that allow you to place the camera outdoors. However, using this as an outdoor camera voids your warranty and there have been many reviews on Amazon that say these enclosures have damaged the camera as it tends to overheat.

I am hearing that NEST is working on an outdoor camera. This is very exciting to hear. However, ultimately, that means another $200 purchase and another $50 a year subscription to add that camera to the system. You see how easily costs add up when investing in this product?

And yes, NEST seems to answer every single one of these type of reviews citing that one does need a subscription to view live streaming. This is true. If you just want the camera to get a live view of the nursery, or check on your parents, you don't have to opt for the subscription. Just realize, if something happens in the frame while you are not viewing -- and you want to know more about it -- you are completely out of luck without the monitoring subscription. NEST offers all customers a free 30-day trial to test out the full aspects of the monitoring service so you can see if you really like it or not. Chances are, you will.

I'll talk more about the monitoring in a moment. I seem to have placed the negatives at the top of this review. Let me go into some positive aspects of this product to offer some fair balance....

This NEST camera is a solid product By that, I mean it is well built, has some nice weight to it (so no worries of tipping over), and many mounting options including a magnetized base (you can actually mount this on a refrigerator) and hardware to mount and screw it into drywall. So kudos to NEST for thinking of everything. You also get a 10' USB power cord. Wish it were black like the camera to make it less obvious, but since many walls are painted white, the cord might actually blend in.

There have been many conflicting reviews about the amount of time it takes to install this product. Certainly, your mileage will vary pending on your level of expertise and the network in your home. For me, it literally took less than 5 minutes from box to install. I took the camera out of the box, plugged it in, went to the NEST app on my iPhone and added it as a device. I simply scanned the QR code on the back of the camera and then entered my WiFi password. Within seconds, I was streaming live video to my phone.

I am also an owner of the NEST thermostat. So perhaps that helped expedite the install process as the NEST uses the same software app. As a NEST thermostat owner I appreciate the fact that I can see all the NEST products on the same app.

Video quality is exceptional. I opted to switch from the default 720p to 1080p recording. While many will not see a huge difference on their small device, it makes a bigger difference when streaming from your laptop or desktop. It also allows you to get more finite detail when reviewing recordings. Personally, I would recommend going with 1080p streaming. I was quite surprised that when I monitored my home activity over my iPhone using nothing more than a cellular connection, the video looked exceptional. I was worried that a cellular monitoring connection would be compromised. However, the video looked great on the NEST app via my iPhone via a 4G LTE connection with very little compression artifacts being introduced into the picture.

Live streaming works rather well, though be aware of the lag time. Since the video needs to be sent from camera to server to viewing device, there is at least a 2 second lag in live action vs. what you view. I suspect if you have a poor WiFi connection, this lag will increase. I tested the lag time over and over again. I would sit, view myself on the browser while raising my arm. It would take two full seconds before that action could be seen on my screen.

The camera offers a fish-eye view of the room. One of the biggest disappointments I have with the NEST over the Amcrest camera is that there is no ability to pan up and down or move the lens from side to side. This would have been an awesome feature to include. However, the amount of information included in its fish-eye view is pretty amazing. You also get a huge amount of depth. In other words, the camera has the ability to reach far back in the room. A zoom feature allows you to bring that depth up close. An enhance feature lets you zoom in and enhance any ""fuzzy"" far-off object. The enhance feature works quite well.

Night vision is simply amazing -- even better than the Amcrest camera I previously owned. NEST really did an outstanding job of putting a first-rate night vision camera into this device. In total darkness, you can monitor movement very well. I was able to capture video of my dog sneaking into the living room and grabbing tissue paper that was left on the floor and tearing it up in her mouth, leaving a mess for the morning. How did it happen? You can simply review it with your cloud monitoring software.

The talk feature is pretty neat, though there is a half second lag involved that makes 2-way communication (like a phone) a bit cumbersome. It also doesn't work on Safari browser, as others have reported. I have to use Chrome or another browser for the flash plug-in that enables this kind of communication to work properly. Still, the feature is kind of cool to use, particularly if you want to yell at your dog to get off the furniture.

Let me talk about the monitoring software and subscription service for a few moments, then I'll return to talking about the pros and cons of the camera...

As I noted at the top of this review, the subscription service is a must. It's so unfortunate that the price is exorbitant. I could have put an entire fleet of these cameras in my home if not for the price of the cameras combined with the subscriptions. Even at 50% off for each additional camera, the costs add up quickly.

However, again, the subscription service is a ""must purchase"" item and you'll quickly and out why once you start using it.

The monitoring software is really neat. First, every time the camera senses movement in the room, it sends you an email alert. Email alerts are kept to a minimum of one every 30 minutes so your mailbox is not bombarded with alerts. From your email alert, you click a VIEW NOW button and you are immediately taken to the point in history where the movement takes place. Mind you, this can be done on any device. What I really love is the fact that you are taken to a point in the recording *seconds before* the movement actually happens. This is essential, as you never miss the actual event. Reviewers that own the Logitech Circle have complained that they are taken to a point in the recording AFTER the event itself so they completely miss it.

Now, the sensitivity of the camera to detect movement is a little high. It detects every little bit of movement in the room. When you become a paid subscriber, you have the ability to set up ACTIVITY ZONES. This allows you to draw a pinpoint area in your room where you want the camera to concentrate on. Want to only detect movement in and out of a sitting chair? Want to detect movement only in a certain portion of your driveway? The software promises the ability to define hot spots within an entire captured area. However, I found this doesn't work very well. Despite setting up these activity zones, the camera still picked up and reported activity outside of these zones. This is an area that NEST really needs to improve.

A huge omission in the software that is provided is the ability to monitor several cameras on one screen. The Amcrest camera allowed a single piece of software with multiple windows that showed several camera activities in the home at once. With NEST you have to open several browsers to monitor all your cameras, or the mobile app, switch from one camera to another which takes several steps to do.

Since I know the folks from NEST are reading this review, I urge them to upgrade their software to enable multiple cameras to be monitored in a single window. According to Amazon reviews, this idea has been suggested to them several times and it seems to have fallen on deaf ears.

Now nearing the end of this review, I want to close by saying the NEST CAM is a quality product both in build and performance. By far, I think this is the security camera that you should consider.

However, that being said, the cost of the hardware combined with the monitoring service --- and considering these costs for years to come --- might drive someone to pay much more up front for a complete home security system with monitoring DVR from a professional surveillance company. Really, I have sat here time and time again justifying the costs of this product, long term, against the costs of buying a professional home surveillance package. Monitoring services with the NEST, alone, is costing me $150 per year and that is only for two cameras. In a couple years that money could have paid off a more elaborate surveillance system with DVR.

I also touched upon the fact that the NEST cannot be used as an outdoor camera, though many are using it with an outdoor enclosure. I am leaning towards trying it, though with the fear I might fry the hardware. Right now, I have the camera pointing inside out of my front bay window. It allows me to monitor the driveway and mailbox. However, it cannot be used at night. The window reflects the night vision LED sensors. To be able to truly use the NEST as an outdoor camera, it needs to be placed in an enclosure outside. That comes with risks.

Absolutely, I will purchase an outdoor camera from NEST when they finally manufacture it. However, as noted previously in the review, that's another $50 per year to monitor the feed.

So, I end this review by simply saying that the NEST CAM has become a love/hate relationship. It's a beautiful camera. It provides exceptional day and night video. It's monitoring capabilities are exceptional, particularly the ability to scrub through days of recorded history. It's email alerts when the camera detects motion and the ability to actually see that movement seconds before it happens is second to none.

However, paying $200 per camera is inane. Combine that with the price of cloud service makes this a product that too many people will either pass over, or like me, think twice about expanding in the home.

What NEST needs to do is become competitive. They either lower the price of these cameras or offer a lower-tier monitoring subscription that allows its customers to want to purchase more cameras to expand their home surveillance network.

UPDATE (August 2016): Nest app and web page now supports multiple camera viewing windows at once. Amcrest still does it slightly better, but this is a great addition for Nest.",positive
113,Camera & Photo Products,Google Nest Cameras,$98.00 - $698.00,1,"UPDATE 9/3/2019 This has to be said.

Most of the time I'm the type of person who says: ""If you can't say anything good about a product, don't say anything at all."" The problem is that there is so much wrong with this product now that I feel I'm obligated to update this review.

Google bought Nest back in 2015. Until recently, Nest customers didn't really notice this fact. I'm sure many of them didn't even realize that Nest was a Google-owned company. Google has now ""taken the reigns"" of Nest and has been systematically dismantling it. The former customers are irate (App Store rating of 1.9 currently) and Google does not seem to care.

They started off small by updating the software to no longer allow the camera LEDs to be turned off. This was an absurd ""privacy"" move. Anyone who purchased a Nest cam for discrete security purposes was very upset at this decision. I was one of these customers. I use a Nest cam for a security camera which is placed inside on a windowsill facing out to view the yard. Nest cameras formerly worked well for this purpose because you could turn off the LED and the night mode function. Now you can no longer turn off the LED and it reflects back from the glass in the image. This problem can be remedied by covering it with a small piece of electrical tape, but you should not have to do this on a $200.00 camera. I should note that the tape fix does not work if you need to use the camera's night mode function because it interferes with the light sensor.

The next genius move by Google was to remove IFTTT support. If you are not familiar with with it, IFTTT is an applet service you can use to link your smart home devices and give them autonomous functionality. This is an awesome free service that really makes smart home products ""smart."" For example, you could link your Nest cam to IFTTT and have it send an e-mail to your work e-mail address if your camera was triggered by a person entering your house. Google nixed IFTTT support on August 31, 2019.

Nest introduced the Nest Secure alarm system back in 2017. This was a nice little DIY wireless alarm system. It was attractive and discrete albeit a little pricey. They even introduced a cellular backup feature for people who wished to self-monitor their alarm systems. Even if someone cut the internet feed to your home, you would still get an alert on your phone when the alarm was triggered via the cellular service. Google has announced they will discontinue the cellular backup service in August 2020.

Therefore I cannot recommend anyone purchase Google Nest devices for their homes. Your purchase may end up being something completely different in the future. This would be like purchasing a refrigerator with an ice maker. A rep. from the company sneaks into your house in the middle of the night and removes the ice maker. The response you get is: ""Sorry we are no longer offering that feature. Your appliance has been updated to reflect this product change."" I think the only way to stop this type of business practice is in the courts. We need laws preventing companies from making feature-removing software/firmware changes to their products without owner consent.

*PREVIOUS REVIEWS*

October, 2016

So far so good for the Nest Cam. I have to admit I was a bit hesitant to purchase this cam after reading some of the negative reviews. I suspect the problems people have had are not the camera's fault because my install and first impressions are very good. I purchased the camera to keep an eye (and ear) on my home when I'm away.

The camera was a snap to install. You just plug it in, download the app to your phone or tablet, and follow the on-screen app instructions for install. I did have a failure on the very first attempt to connect to my WiFi, but the second ""retry"" attempt connected immediately and I have not experienced any other connect failures.

Before you purchase a Nest Cam, I would highly recommend downloading WiFi signal strength and speed test apps. Hold your phone in the location you intend to install the cam and run the signal strength and speed test apps. If your signal is weak, you may need to re-position your router or get a range extender. If you plan on running your Nest Cam at 1080p resolution, the cam will use up to 1.2 Mbps of bandwidth. The default quality setting is 720p. I found the default quality to be more than adequate for a security cam so I just left it alone.

One of the features I really like about the Nest Cam is the sound alert function. The camera will monitor sound in the room and send you an alert if it hears a sound that is different from the normal background noise (i.e. a smoke alarm or a breaking window). It also looks for motion and will send an alert if the camera sees someone moving in the room. You can even use the sound function to talk to anyone who happens to be in the room. ""The police have been notified. I suggest you get out of my house."" Sound alerts are disabled by default so be sure you turn it on in the settings if you want this feature.

Now for the cons. One complaint I have is with the cam response time for turning on and connecting to the app. I want my cam to be on when I'm away and off when I'm home. I've found that it takes about 30 seconds for the cam to come on-line after touching the ""Away"" button. The only other solution for me is to have the cam on all the time, but I don't have the desire for this. There is a scheduler function that you can use to turn your cam on for a defined period of time each day, but that will only be useful if your schedule is very consistent.

The best option I've found is to use the scheduler function for my work days and the ""Home/Away"" function for my days off or when my work schedule varies. This is a nuisance considering the high-tech. nature of this device. In my opinion it really shouldn't require so much manual intervention by the user. (I deducted 1 star for this.) It seems that Nest wants you to leave your camera on 24/7, but this seems really unnecessary to me. I don't want to waste bandwidth recording every minute of my life when I'm at home. A geo-fencing ability for the cam to automatically come online when it senses your mobile devices are away would be a very welcome feature.

Overall, I would say the Nest Cam is a really cool product. Its features provide a lot of versatility for use and It adds another layer of security to your home even if you already have an alarm system. I've only had it for a month so I can't comment on its long term reliability yet, but I'll update my review if I have any problems.

UPDATE 7/17/16 No Problems

The Nest Cam is still working. I'm pleased to update that they have added geo-fencing (+1 star). This resolves my biggest complaint about having to manually enable the cam if you don't want it recording 24/7. You can link the cam to one or more smartphones or tablets and have the camera automatically turn on when the camera detects that the devices are not in the area. So far, it seems to be working pretty well. Whenever I'm not at home and I check my phone, the cam is on. When I return with my phone, the cam automatically turns off.

It probably isn't the best choice for someone interested in a ultra high-security application. The cam is dependent on WiFi so if someone cuts your internet connection or jams the signal, the cam won't see a thing. However, if the cam has lost internet connectivity for at least 30 minutes, the Nest server will notify you. You can increase the security of your connection by using a cellular WiFi hotspot for the cam and a UPS for the power adapters.

If you need a cam that lets you check in on your home when you're on vacation to make sure it's not burning down, flooding or broken-into, Nest Cam does the job. I think it is a useful product and I'm eagerly awaiting the outdoor version.

UPDATE 2/26/17

The Nest cams are still working well. I added 2 additional cams for a total of 3 to monitor the interior of the house as well as the front and back yards. I decided to go with indoor cams pointed out windows instead of the outdoor cam for convenience and ease of installation. I have some high mounted sun windows in the house that are perfect for putting a camera in. As long as you have decent lighting outside, the cams work just fine even after dark. All I had to do was disable the front LEDs and turn off night vision. If you are home with the lights on, the reflection from the interior lights may make it difficult to see outside, but with the interior lights off they work really well. This is just fine for me because I wanted the cameras to monitor my house when I'm not at home. Nest also continues to improve the software. You can now view multiple cams in one window, and they've added an image quality function that automatically selects the best quality based on your connection.

I did have remove one star from my rating due to the competition that Nest Cam has now. Unfortunately, Nest continues to gouge its customers with pricey subscription fees to get cloud storage when its competitors are offering free cloud storage. Therefore, my next cam will probably not be a Nest Cam.

12/30/18

I've been living with these cameras for almost 3 yrs now. All of my cameras are still working and overall I'm pleased with this product. Nest devices are quality products and I've even added a thermostat and the Nest protect smoke/CO detectors.

I've all but eliminated the app delays by upgrading my wifi router. The cameras turn on automatically via the application's home/away feature. I even bit the bullet and subscribed to the Nest Aware service for 2 of my cameras to get full functionality. Rarely, the home/away function fails to turn on or off the cameras. This used to happen more often so they must be fixing bugs on a regular basis. Overall, the reliability for the cameras and app have been very good.

My #1 complaint with the Nest cams would be that they force you into a subscription service to obtain full camera functionality. You must have a Nest Aware subscription to create activity zones and have the person recognition feature. Personally I feel that they should give a 24hr subscription for free and charge extra if you want more storage time. If you don't subscribe, in 30 days, you will have a crippled version of the camera. It's not like Nest is some struggling startup that needs the money. Nest is owned by Google.",negative
114,Camera & Photo Products,Google Nest Cameras,$98.00 - $698.00,5,"I have three major complaints with most security cameras. First, it’s easy for hackers to attack them. Manufacturers are too busy developing new models to fix bugs in the old ones. Nest is a Google company. Google is very good with security. Of course, you must secure your Google account with a strong password and preferably with 2-factor authentication. If somebody breaks into your Google account, they can turn the camera off. Or they can turn it on, look around your home, and even talk to the babysitter. This would totally freak out any teenager I know, and rightfully so.

My second complaint is that the cameras work fine until a glitch or power failure causes the camera to drop the Wi-Fi connection. After that, they won’t work until you unplug the camera to reset it. The Nest camera is excellent hardware and very robust. After a glitch, the Nest camera reconnects to the Wi-Fi without fail. It also sends a notification so you know if the camera is disconnected from the Wi-Fi.

My third complaint is that most cameras are stupid. I had a camera send dozens of notifications a day because the answering machine light was blinking. Nest does intrusion detection on the server, not in the camera. Nest Aware is an option (with a monthly fee) that adds smart intrusion detection. “Sound” becomes “Person talking”, “Dog barking”, and “All other sounds”. “Motion” becomes “People” and “All other motion”. “People” detection works very well. If a person walks into the room, Nest servers will trigger a person event. As long as the person stays in the room, there are no more person events. If the person exits the room, then re-enters it a few seconds later, Nest triggers another person event. Nest Aware also records video and lets you make video clips.

Events don’t always trigger notifications. This drove me nuts. I was waving my arms in front of the camera and not getting notifications. The first 3 Nest support people I talked with didn’t know why. After a notification is sent, there are no additional notifications until a 10 to 15 minute “cool down” period is over. If a second event is detected halfway through the cool down, the timer starts over again. There must be no events for the entire cool down period before Nest sends another notification. Also, one can watch the video, see that events are declared, and receive no notifications (as I did). If someone is watching the video, they don’t need notifications. So says Nest.

Notifications can be sent to your smart phone as a push notification and/or sent to your Email. Email notifications come with an attached picture. If other family members install the Nest ap on their phone, they can share camera control and notifications using their Google account.

I like the privacy that Nest provides. A green light, which cannot be disabled, indicates when the camera is sending video to the server.

Here’s some things I don’t like about Nest. Because intrusion detection is done at the server, Nest continuously sends video when the camera is on. You can set “Bandwidth/Quality” to low, medium, or high. But if your internet service has restricted bandwidth or data limits, Nest may not be for you. The “pictures” attached to Email notifications are actually frame grabs from a compressed video. Even if video quality is set to High, there is not much detail in a person’s face. If you don’t use the monthly service, intrusion detection is stupid. You won’t get dozens of notifications a day from a blinking light. But you will get a notification every time the timer turns the lights on. Finally, Nest support people are friendly and helpful with normal setup options. But they don’t have good in-depth knowledge of how Nest works. (Hence this long review.)

Here’s a small nit that Google might eventually fix. My Nest ap is on my Android phone. If I turn on “Do not Disturb”, I don’t get a sound when I receive a notification. Do Not Disturb does not have a way of allowing Nest push notifications through. If I’m wrong about this, please let me know in the comments, because I would love to have this feature.

Nest is a great product. In my opinion, most of the negative reviews it has received are not warranted. Many of its important features are not appreciated. Buy the Nest and turn it on. It will do what you want it to do. But don’t try to figure out why it does what it does. It will drive you nuts.",positive

There seems to be confusion in the reviews. It appears that different generations of cameras were being reviewed (with different apps that handled the equipment).

117,Camera & Photo Products,Google Nest Cameras,$98.00 - $698.00,5,"Given how long ago this model was released, it really does still hold up and is a lot better than most newer cameras. The set up was extremely easy and straight forward (so long as you actually read the prompts and can follow simple direction :) . We use it as a baby monitor and love it especially when paired with our hub and hub max. Alerts can be customized from movement and audio to just movement or just audio.

The field of few is really nice which makes up for not having a large pan field (again, I acknowledge that this is the older model and a lot of newer stuff has this.

What I really was surprised by and actually liked, was the weight of the product. It has a little weight to it and is very solid for its design. I actually like that cause I don't feel like I am going to break it if I look at it the wrong way like some other cameras. The mounting plate is also nice and I like that the camera attaches via magnet (don't worry it is strong). But there are other mounting options out there via 3rd party.

If you are looking for simple room monitoring, I highly recommend this product. Especially since you don't need to subscribe to Nest Aware if you don't want. Be warned though you will not have active video storage if you don't have nest aware. That wasn't a huge deal for me though.

However, if you are looking for a ton of different features with the latest and greatest in video quality, sounds and feature, then I would look elsewhere. If only for the fact that this came out 7 years ago and tech has come a long way. But be warned, a lot of the other stuff out there require subscriptions to their services, in order to access all the features.",positive

The facial recognition works great, but I don't care if it sees my kids in the living room. I do care if it's see somebody it doesn't recognize. Unfortunately notifications are all or nothing. Seems to me it'd be very simple to set it to only recognize on certain people or unknown people",positive
119,Camera & Photo Products,Google Nest Cameras,$98.00 - $698.00,5,"For almost a year, the camera worked for us without fail. We started using this in lieu of a baby monitor after many fails with the  Motorola MBP36S Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor . We love being able to check in via our phones and on the web while at work, on-the-go and during dates. We signed up for the Nest Aware subscription service as well and we can watch video playback whenever we want and we can even make clips to show relatives our now toddler son's funny antics.

As we previously wrote, we use an  Apple iPod touch 16GB Blue (6th Generation)  for an iPod but we kept having playback issues. It turned out that all the issues were having with that AND the Nest Cam were due to wifi dead zones in our home. We recently upgraded our router to the  Google Wifi system (set of 3) - Router replacement for whole home coverage  and our wifi is now at lightning speed above 100 mps. I do not get this camera unless you have very good, stable wifi.

When we were just about to hit the year mark when we started to have problems with the camera going offline by itself without reason. When we tried to reset it, we'd get error C102 repeatedly which isn't mentioned on their website. It's incredibly frustrating as we depend on this camera and we paid a great deal for it (more than its now listed price). We called customer service and they were incredibly helpful. As it turns out, we needed a replacement wall power adapter and they sent a replacement out quickly.

We haven't had any problems with the Nest Cam since even when our son pushed it off the corner of his crib where we used to keep it before he learned to stand up. We now keep the Nest Cam across the room with an eye on his crib and we've set up zone alerts to tell us when there's movement in the crib specifically. We also get alerts in the Nest app and to our emails when it sees ""someone"" in the room outside of the zone we created around the crib or when someone is heard in the room.

The Nest app has improved since we first got this camera two years ago. When you log in now to the Nest app, you the video right away and you can press on it for sound and close-ups. Even though the Nest Cam doesn't pan or tilt like many baby monitors, it has captures a view of the entire room (see attached photos). The picture quality in daylight is incredible. It feels like I'm in the room with my son. As for the night vision, I think it's pretty good. The picture is clearer when I sign onto the web for night vision than on my iPhone.

I've recently started using the microphone more now that my son is getting closer to age two. If he wakes up during the night and thinks it's morning, I gently tell him to go back to sleep because it's night time and he will turn right over and do that. I don't like that you can't hear what you're saying as you talk into the microphone. You hold down the microphone on the app to speak and you're heard on the other end. I know I've been heard because I instantly get an alert that someone was heard in the room.

If I could afford it, I would put cameras up in all the rooms. And not for security. The Nest Cam has captured incredibly gorgeously rendered moments in my son's life. From the time we discovered he could (gulp) climb onto his dresser, to the time he learned to climb up onto his changing table and the play dates with his friend where they sit on the adult and toddler sized recliners in his room to read.

This wasn't offered when I first bought mine but it's very handy if you're looking to have more cameras at a discounted price:  Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera 3 Pack . I have been so impressed with this product that I have since purchased a  Nest Cam Outdoor Security Camera  because we had such a great time using the regular indoor Nest Cam as a security camera when we were away from home. The microphone sensitivity can be adjusted and we put it on high while we were on vacation and placed it in our dining room by the window. It let us know when it heard and/or saw both the mailman and handyman and we were able to communicate to the latter that we weren't home. We also plan to invest in the  Nest Learning Thermostat, 3rd Generation, Works with Amazon Alexa .",positive

122,Camera & Photo Products,"12x42 HD Binoculars for Adults with Upgraded Phone Adapter, Tripod and Tripod Adapter - Large View Binoculars with Clear Low Light Vision - Waterproof Binoculars for Bird Watching Hunting Travel",$49.86,5,"I dont know a great deal about binoculars, but decided to buy my mother a “good” set since she moved to Florida and started to casually take up bird watching. Wanting to go with a reputable brand and after a few hours of research and reading, i went with Vortex Diamondbacks and had them delivered to her home. Since i was taking a trip to visit, i found these for $25 and figured I’d buy them just to see what the extra money actually got her since the style, size, and descriptions are almost identical. There is a clear difference when you compare the imagines switching back and forth. THAT SAID - the difference the extra $225 made is not nearly as large as you’d expect. Its the Ultra fine details, the edges, and sharpness/clarity of the objects at distance that are noticeable. I honestly expected to be blown away how much better the Vortex was - but i wasnt. You’d really have to be an optics guy to appreciate the small difference in image quality. I mean the difference is there, but its a very small difference. I’m CERTAIN the Vortex is a “better” binocular, not to mention the support you get from a good brand that will stand behind a product they warranty without question. They simply feel better too as soon as you pick them up - but these two brands are extremely similar in feel, style and features. Meaning, for 90% - 95% of people these would be just as good as the Vortex unless you’re REALLY willing to spend a lot more money for not much difference. So if you are an average person thats looking to buy a set “just to have them”, to bring to a football game, to enjoy yourself outdoors, try your hand at birdwatching, ect - I wouldn’t hesitate buying these. If there is any chance of them getting lost, stolen, broken, or generally beat up - dont spend the extra money. If you decide later that you wanna buy something better, than consider these as your insurance in a backup pair, or a second set to lend to a friend. You really, really cant complain about what you get for the money. The case is garbage compared to a vortex, its just a basic pouch - but it serves its purpose. These even come with lens covers - just like the Vortex - (they dont fit as well) but buying those alone separately would probably cost $10. As far as bang for your buck - from an average guys opinion, i cant see a better option than this. If i were to try to set a scale comparing them against the Vortex Diamondbacks, if the Diamondbacks were a 10 - these would be a 8.5 in an overall comparison (not just clarity). I can only imagine the difference between these and say the Vortex Crossfire’s (one step below the Diamondbacks) would be even smaller. When it comes to things like this, just like rifle scopes, small differences come at a big expense, and I imagine a large chuck of the cost for a pair of binoculars from a place like Vortex is to cover the costs of a large company and their marketing - which these dont have to pay for. At the price, (esp at the $25 i paid) you have absolutely nothing to lose. If you already have a good set, and just want a second pair - buy these. You’ll be amazed at how good these are for the money.

Lastly - for those who dont know what the number mean - (10x40) (12x50) - the first number is the power of the magnification (10 times closer, 12 times closer) and the second is the size larger lens (how big of an area it will allow you to see when you look through). For bird watching, experts claim the ideal sizes are either 10x42 or 12x42.. you dont want something extremely powerful, but you want something with a larger lens so its easier to find what your looking for, and keep looking at it while it’s moving (like a bird, obviously, or even a football game, Anything that can be moving at speed). A size 50 lens is physically a bigger (And would give you a larger picture) but are a larger heavier set of binoculars - so the 42 lens is a great compromise. For a easy way to think of it - to give people a rough idea, say a 12x20 you would be able to see a large bird at distance, but he may take up the entire “screen” (for lack of a better word) as you looked through those binoculars - where with a 12x45 set you would see the same bird just as large - but you’d also be able to see a large area around him. So Its easier to find him, and if he moves you can easily follow him and also see whats around him. There is not a huge difference between a 10x or 12x set of binoculars, so dont go crazy like i did. (I ordered and canceled 3 times before i finally picked what size on the Vortex). But if you were on the fence trying to decide if these were worth your money - Yes, they are. You’ll be surprised and impressed what the money got you.",positive

I didn't want any subscription fees. I used a micro SD. (If you want to record without Micro SD that's a subscription).

I don't think we can download the videos for free as you use their app to download them and THAT says you need a subscription (from what I gathered).

I downloaded a screen recorder, and just record the footage I need (like the vid I posted). It's a work around that is FREE! If I couldn't get a work around, I'd have dinged them a star.

The first one I got was a dud, it was stuck pointing up, would not tilt. I got to use the Amazon return and replace option for the first time, worked great. If you get a dud, reorder it, try cam #2.

The scheduling to record certain times doesn't seem to work. What I do is this, the camera has a shielding option...when I'm home, on the app, I click camera shield (not recording/pointed up/down) and and before I leave I toggle to remove shielding.

I couldn't go back to leaving my dog alone without a cam. A+ purchase.

At only five pounds, Lily, my new (and most wonderful) friend, has had a great deal of anxiety as a consequence of these early-life experiences. When I leave my house to run errands on which she cannot accompany me, I crate her, and I have been (out of my own dog-guardian anxiety!) worried about how she handles my absence during those periods. A colleague of mine suggested Wansview, and she could not have been more correct.

Reviews of the application through which the Wansview camera works (I will discuss set-up momentarily) paint a curiously negative picture, some saying that recent changes in the application have made it difficult to sustain a connection with the camera. I downloaded the application, as the instructions requested, and I began the setup process. I thought I had done it properly and was thus surprised when the camera could not seem to establish an audiovisual connection between its recording lens and my cellphone. Here, two points must be noted, both of which will hopefully gesture toward the quality of the product and the excellent customer service Wansview offers.

First, the error on my part--the instructions say clearly that a new user must wait to hear certain phrases emitted by the camera's microphone to confirm that it is completely operational. Due to hasty reading on my part, I did not notice the final phrase for which one was supposed to wait, the content of which offered confirmation of a secure, steady Internet signal. Within about ten minutes of the camera having been installed, I received a notification to update my firmware to the latest version (this notification was not the consequence of any complaint I had registered; it was simply the application informing me that new firmware was available). I downloaded the firmware, and the feed began to work. Since then, I have never had a problem with accessing the feed, and I am able to check in on Lily while I am running errands. Never having owned a dog, I have had my fair share of first-dog anxiety, and I am now able to determine how long after my departure Lily whines (steadily decreasing and now only lasting a few minutes) and check in on her while she is in her crate to ensure that she is sleeping and safe. The relief of that knowledge alone makes the product worthwhile. The quality of the feed is also excellent, so much so that I play it in its SD variety (I haven't needed to go the HD route because everything is already clear as crystal). The application is incredibly easy to use, and since the successful installation I have not had to do anything.

Now, for the second point. Between my initial installation of the application and the ten to fifteen minutes it took for the firmwarm to update and for the camera to start working (during that time I could not maintain or open a connection between the camera's feed and my cellphone), I sent an e-mail to Wansview's customer service department. One of their agents, Melody, responded within 24 hours. Not only did she provide me with instructions on how to begin to assess what the potential issue might be and how she could help me address that, she explained that Wansview so stands by its products that if my camera proved defective I could return it at no charge or have it replaced. Because the camera was already working, I made a note to myself to reply to her e-mail later in the day.

When, due to my own error, I forgot to reply to Melody's message, confirming that the camera was indeed working, she followed up me with via e-mail to confirm that I had received her message and to ask what she could do to help ensure that the camera was working. I do not know if I have ever had a customer-service experience during which a company representative reached out to me a second time because I mistakenly failed to reply to their first message. In her second message, she reiterated her commitment to helping me ensure that the product worked properly and that Wansview's ethic was one that stood behind the quality of its products and the quality of customers' experiences with those products. I immediately replied, thanked her for her message, and explained how happy I was with the quality of the product.

In short, even if you experience any issues with this camera during setup, it seems like Wansview takes very seriously its commitment to customer service. As someone not altogether fluent in techno-gadgetry, the abundant interest in helping to ensure that I could use the camera with use certainly marks out Wansview as unique in my experience. And, the price is a terribly affordable one. All in all, I would encourage anyone to consider buying this camera, and, if they choose to do so, to buy it with the ease of knowing that there is an active customer-service team happy to interface with you and help resolve any issues.",positive

I bought an SD card for it, but there's no need for one (I don't save any videos except for the occasional screenshot/video clip). The only complaint I have is that sometimes the camera doesn't work while I'm gone and I can't reset it/fix it until I get back. That has only happened a couple times though, and hasn't been a problem in a while. Overall, good purchase for the price.",positive

It does more that you'd expect....

Long version: Like others you might have looked at the reviews and wondered about the negative ones. I did too. Well it’s worth remembering that you don’t know anything about the skill level or anything else about the person writing the review. Hey, that’s applies to me too!

Packaging: no complaints, it’s all there; power cube, cable, mounting bracket and screws.

Setup: no complaints. Just install the app, create an account and follow the instructions on the app to connect. It will ONLY work on a 2.4G WiFi connection and you’ll need the password for your 2.4G network. Frankly those having difficulty connecting this product are likely to have difficulty with ANY similar camera as they ALL follow the same connection format.

Usage: the online app provides everything that any reasonable person would need and it’s easy to use too. The desktop app isn’t anywhere near as developed as the phone app…. but the device wasn’t intended to be used from a PC.

Picture Quality.
It’s great. I can monitor my car at night without issue.

Local storage:
A (not supplied) 128G micro-sd will store about 14 days of my (fairly comprehensive) video. No issues.
Cloud Storage: VERY reasonably priced, fully integrated into the app and works very well providing the instances where motion was detected

Motion Detection.
All those complaining that “it doesn’t provide continuous monitoring” are missing the point and have unreasonable expectations. Here’s the deal; nobody wants to have a continuous recording of, say their baby sleeping, or their car parked on the street because those images aren’t interesting. What IS interesting and useful to have a recording and an alert when SOMETHING HAPPENS. Like baby moves. Or someone is close to your car. Or there is free pizza…. Now, if you really want to have as close to “continuous” recording as possible, just set the sensitivity level to max and it will record the slightest movement. You’ll probably turn the sensitivity level down when you find that recordings of “no movement” was caused by a moth flying by.

In short, I have 4 and more are on the way. It’s less than $30 so buy some already. You have just spent more than $30 of your time reading these reviews.",positive

152,Camera & Photo Products,"eufy Security Solo IndoorCam P24, 2K, Pan & Tilt, Indoor Security Camera, Wi-Fi Plug-in Camera, Human & Pet AI, Voice Assistant Compatibility, Night Vision, Motion Tracking, HomeBase not Compatible",$54.99,4,"I bought this to keep an eye on my digital printer. It works well, has a good range, it was able to connect to the wifi in the basement, 2 floors to where the modem is. Night mode is very good, better than the lights I have now.

The software needs work, I would love to be able to create zones of interest or a program but it doesn't have that. The sounds in the camera viewing are loud, but the camera itself moving, is not. There is also a loud click when the nightmode turns on, not sure if the camera makes that noise or its just on the recording. But if you are listening for sounds in the room, the camera makes it while watching.

There is no graphic on the screen showing the viewing angle or limits.

It does have a nice feature where you can hit 360 and it will spin around then go back to the original position.

There is a notification if there is someone in the room. But only when viewing the camera. If the app was open it will send the notification, but often it doesn't send me anything if it wasn't open. It seems intermittent.

Now the good and bad - I can access this camera anywhere on any network. Which is good, I can view my house from my hotel room and move it around... But that also means it has to go through their network which means:

1. If the cable is out, I can't access the camera (I haven't tried that yet but it makes sense). There is no way to switch it to just MY OWN network.

2. Because it goes to their base first, its not really protected. While they claim its encoded, they have the decryption key and anything can be hacked. So don't be naked in front of this camera.

3. Because it has to go to home base, the keys are often not all responsive. So like in the morning, I was trying to move it but couldn't because it lagged or something. But at midnight it moved around without any effort at all. So if a lot are using their system, you may not be getting a responsive touch.

I'm also not seeing where it stores the videos on the card.

And it also bugs me that there is no way to disable the very obvious light on the front of this thing. If its hidden, you can totally see that light.

The tracking works pretty well but its not smart. So like if I have it on and I put a hand in the screen, it does nothing. If there is a head, it will track it, but if I quickly jump back out of view, it stops tracking. I haven't tried the sound alert yet.

The controls are jerky, I want a smooth transition, this is more like a pump the gas, pump the breaks sort of movement. Hard to fine tune it.

Its a good camera for the price, does a lot, but has some issues.

Updated 5-6-22

a few things I learned.

1. If you lose connection to the net, you can't use this camera. If the site is down, too bad, if they go out of business, you can't use this camera. There is no option to have it on your own network only, everything has to go through them.

Which also means that if there is lag and there is a lot of lag, your camera lags. So like if there was a person in the room, and you wanted to spin the camera, it may not respond at all. I've had that issue with the night vision turning on and off.

2. The motion works but not well. Its not smart. If you quickly run under it you can move behind it fast. If you are static in the picture and move your hand, it focuses on the hand or the movement. If you are in frame and move out of frame fast, it stays in that position and then in 30 sec then it goes back. But it doesn't look in the direction you left in. I think it should rotate a bit if it lost the prey.

3. If you set motion to everything, it catches invisible dust flakes, even on the lower positions. I kept getting alerts it was annoying. And if you have a black out period on your phone, it won't show you that someone was seen unless you look at the camera in the app.

4. YOU MUST HAVE A PHONE TO USE THIS CAMERA. They don't have a PC app, only a phone.

Would I get another one of these cameras? No. I would look for something that used my own internal private network with the option of using the cloud. I don't like the thought that someone could hack the line and become an intermediate. And as much as they say they respect my privacy, the thought that my signal is traveling across to who even knows where, does bother me. And it bugs me that there is a lot of lag in the system. I won't change my rating, because the camera does work, it has a nice picture. I do wish I could turn on the night vision as an exclusive option, I can only turn it off.

I use this as a way to see my shop, printer, etc. As a security camera, I would probably choose something else. Not to mention that I think if someone were to scan the bar code on the bottom, they would probably have a feed too.",positive
153,Camera & Photo Products,"eufy Security Solo IndoorCam P24, 2K, Pan & Tilt, Indoor Security Camera, Wi-Fi Plug-in Camera, Human & Pet AI, Voice Assistant Compatibility, Night Vision, Motion Tracking, HomeBase not Compatible",$54.99,3,"This review will be for many Eufy Cameras and the system as a whole. Review done in July 2022. All Settings were set with Surveillance performance as a priority. All firmware updated to the latest versions.

Bottom line: Relatively good for a ""no subscription"" service but camera feature disparity (every camera seems to have one feature but not another, so annoying), the absolute worst cloud recording and very poor web interface makes this a NOT RECOMMEND review as a system. Individual Cameras are decent otherwise if you're doing a one camera thing.

Eufy Cloud Recording service - Does not support all (or many cameras). 2K cameras downgraded to 1080p with Cloud Recording (Seriously, WTF). Only cameras with an SD Card slot can bypass cloud recording. So non-SD Card slot cameras get forced onto 1080p recording whether you like it or not. (WTF!), Not recommended, don't even test it out. Some cameras you'll be locked into 1080p recording, Most cameras don't even support it. Waste of money.

Eufy Dual Cam Doorbell Battery - Works well enough, My 24/7 old Nestcam pointed through the window proved it misses some events. Over exposed video causing the sky to lack clarity but more importantly, poor capturing license plate info. Uses the homebase 2 which includes 8GB storage. Kinda crap. No SD Slot option. The SD slot Eufy cameras opens 24/7 recording this does not have that option. Does not work with Cloud Recording. Dual camera is a killer feature but its very Beta right now and a hose box I have is being detected as a package all the time. So many false positives. Max detection range is very short. The Ring Video Doorbell 2 this replaced would catch people who walk by. They are ignored even on the max setting. Using Alexa Show's to view on button push with this is very unreliable but so was the Ring. Still no two way talk. Using the Alexas as a doorbell works well and had no issues as of yet. Notifications are a little disappointing with this and all Eufy cameras as the three options are No pic, First empty then second with pic and with Pic but barely works. Basically if you want consistency, you're going to have to pick the second option and get two notifications for each event. Battery performance kills my former Ring Doorbell. 8 days, 214 detected events and at 83%. If you're totally against paying for a subscription cloud recording service, this isn't terrible. But if you are willing, then you should skip this.

Eufy Pro 2C Camera: Requires a homebase. No SD Card slot, no 24/7 recording option. Forced downgrade to 1080p with cloud recording subscription, no option to opt out (WTF!). Mounting options kinda suck. Screw in the back of the unit and screw in a fairly cheap plastic mount. Feels very easy to steal or vandalize, just screw it off. Can't read license plates 20ft away. Low frame rates may be part of the reason. Video quality is pretty good, lacks the resolution to capture large writing. Weak spotlight, won't even use it. Notifications have the same issue as the Dual doorbell. 3 days with many events went 100%>83% battery (Not great). Not recommended. I should return this....

Eufy SoloCam S40 Solar Battery Camera: Nice surprise. Installed in a location where there's plenty of sunlight and it seems to keep this charged at 98-100% battery, even after 7 days. Graph says 2724 mah charged, 1.9 days of solar charging but YMMV. Very Bright Spotlight. Color Night vision with spotlight is more like it doesn't need night vision because of the spotlight. No SD Card Slot, so no 24/7 recording. Has 8GB internal storage. 7 days with many events is using half that already. Might be a problem. Connects directly to your wifi and wifi signal quality will affect video quality. Doesn't support cloud recording so no issue with getting kicked down to 1080p but you'll never have the option. Video Quality is good otherwise. Needs to do better detecting humans vs dogs. Thinks my dog is human. Seems to be a keeper even with the pitfalls.

Eufy Indoor Cam C24 and Pan/Tilt P24: These two cameras seem like the same except the P24 has Pan and tilt. Picture quality is good, wired and needs power, has SD card slot for 24/7 recording. SD Card negates cloud storage so you can 2k record with the SD Card but cloud still downgrades you to 1080p. At least you can get out of cloud recording by just recording to the SD Card. Motion Tracking on the Pan/tilt camera works well when it works. Often needs calibrating. Thats bad. I wish there was a Go home after x minutes feature. It says it does but never seems to and with the need to calibrate every few days it kinda sucks. Geofencing doesn't work well. I want to turn off the camera when I'm home and turn it on but it continues to record throughout. Pan/Tilt is 360 degree so it can capture all around it. Tough to mount this to use it effectively as I don't really want it in the middle of a room. These are the cheapest cameras and they're fairly full featured. If you are only getting a camera or two for inside, this isn't bad at all.

Overall, I like many of the cameras individually but I despise the cameras as a system. It's like there's 20 departments at Eufy/Anker in competition with each other and was told to make a camera. It's all so different and even the newer cameras are missing things that the older cameras used to have and vice versa. Odd. Hard to recommend if you're looking for many cameras to secure your house. I really wish the new Nest cameras worked on the old app. That app was perfect and their cameras are outstanding but the new Google Home Nest experience is absolutely a mess now. Ring's App experience is wonderful but the camera hardware is left wanting. I haven't tried Arlo mainly because they're a bit expensive. Blink seems too low quality for my liking based on other reviews. It's really a tough time to want to upgrade your security cameras right now. I will probably live with the quirks and weaknesses that Eufy cameras have right now and hope much of it can be solved by software updates. Not holding my breath though and probably will upgrade in a few years when i see improvement in the segment.",fair

So I was looking for something to help me pet sit not bought for home security. I was originally looking at a Furbo which is $150 more than this camera. The only difference between the two (other than price) is that the Furbo allows you to give treats. Since I don’t really need that feature the Eufy was the better choice for me. I really like the alerts I get when my dog is barking or unsettled and you can turn them off if too annoying. The picture is very clear. I also like the Eufy over Furbo because it allows you to move the camera vertically as well as horizontally.
I see the other reviews on here concerning privacy issues with this unit. I feel that is not an issue for me as I only have it plugged in when I leave the house, otherwise it stays in the box. Very happy with this purchase.",positive

The motion and sound detection work very well. It also has a pet command which I use with the Pet Setting. When my cat comes into focus, she hears me call her name. The camera will follow her as she moves through the room. I love using the speaker when I find her doing something she shouldn't be. The Smart Detection is well done. Well worth the money for a security system that doesn't break the bank. You can set it up with Apple Home Kit or Google Assist. eufy Security offers Protection/Monitoring plans. You can set up cameras and sensors that will detect a critical event and notify the monitoring center. I am extremely satisfied with this product and may install an outdoor cam as well.",positive
156,Camera & Photo Products,"eufy Security Solo IndoorCam P24, 2K, Pan & Tilt, Indoor Security Camera, Wi-Fi Plug-in Camera, Human & Pet AI, Voice Assistant Compatibility, Night Vision, Motion Tracking, HomeBase not Compatible",$54.99,2,"I bought this camera to use as part of my smart home HomeKit ecosystem. This is the third camera I've purchased all from different manufacturers, and it is by far the cheapest of the 3. I wasn't expecting this to be better than the others, but to work decently as an affordable camera. Almost every problem I have with it is caused by something mentioned in the Notes section of the description.

First of all, setup is not as easy as every other HomeKit device I've installed. You cannot just scan the QR code. You MUST install the eufy security app (which requires creating an account), connect to it from there, and then add it to HomeKit from within their app. This turned what's usually a 30 second install into a 20 minute install.

Once you add it to HomeKit this immediately causes a lot of features to be disabled. Fortunately nothing I needed, but it's notable since none of the other cameras I add disable these features so I'm not sure why eufy does. I guess they would prefer you to buy into their system instead of HomeKit.

Another thing of note is that an SD card is needed for local storage, which is not included. So cloud storage is the only option. HomeKit provides this so it's not a huge deal for me, but is a notable limitation especially considering eufy charges for cloud storage. And what's also of note is that the 2K resolution will pretty much always be downgraded to 1080p when using cloud storage. Looks like local storage is the only thing that can handle the 2K resolution, which does not come in the box. But who cares about 2K, right? It's only in the name of the product.

One thing I will say is good about these security cameras is that you can pan and tilt. It must be done from within the eufy security app, but this is understandable since HomeKit does not support those features (yet)—it's still very handy to have around! Unfortunately it does not tilt downward very far, making its placement on a table or shelf rather impractical if you want to be able to see the floor. I'm using my cameras for my cats and they are on the floor a lot. This means I have to put it either lower to the ground or rig the base to tilt more downward. I feel like this device is better mounted to a wall or ceiling where its tilt and pan would give a complete view of any room. I can't comment on how difficult that is—I might do that eventually—but it was nice to see a tripod mount on the bottom of the unit, which would give me a ton of mounting options.

And now to the final issue, which in my opinion is completely unforgivable. This device only supports 2.4Ghz WiFi and DOES NOT SUPPORT 5GHZ. Which means streaming 1080p video is going to be an absolute slog. Especially if you live in an urban area, like I do. Who would design a streaming security camera without 5Ghz WiFi? Only eufy I guess. And of course while I'm watching live video over my WiFi it is ridiculously choppy, through either the eufy app or the Home app. I have another camera that streams 10x better through their app than the Home app, so I was hoping eufy might have at least built in a proprietary solution like that, but nope. And this problem doesn't only appear in live streaming—since the recordings are being sent to the cloud, they're also choppy there too. The problem only gets worse when there's actually something happening on the camera; you know, like, when it's needed the most. Faces get blurred, frames get skipped. I can't imagine anyone trying to use this for actual security, since it's liable to completely miss a burglary in action. Maybe it's better if I buy their service, but I'm not going to do that nor would I trust them very much considering the low quality of their products.

In short, this camera fails at being a decent HomeKit camera and is unreliable for security purposes, which is what it was designed for. I guess sometimes you do get what you pay for, but I should have paid even less.",negative

The camera picture quality and night vision are A++. No issues with using it and seeing the surroundings.

Setup was a bit odd, it only uses 2.4ghz Wi-Fi which I find absolutely absurd in 2022. But it does the job, also it couldn’t find my Wi-Fi connection at riders so I had to restart it and try again for initial setup but since then, no issues maintaining connection.

AI/Motion Detection works well however the camera identifies the dog as a human which I found a bit strange so as my dog was going up and down on the bed in the room, my phone was blowing up saying it’s detecting a human in the room.

162,Camera & Photo Products,"Reolink 4MP Indoor Security Camera E1 Pro, Plug-in Camera with 2.4/5 GHz WiFi, Pan&Tilt, Two Way Talk, Ideal for Baby Monitor/ Pet Camera",$42.49,2,"This is for the E1 Pro I purchased less than a week ago. I bought this camera for it's Wi-Fi capability and because it worked with USB power. My plan was to place this camera in my truck and run it off of my USB power port and send the video to Blue Iris to record. We have had an increasing number of mailbox pirates along our street and my outdoor house security cameras are not close enough to get a good image when they are on foot or get the license plate when they drive by to check the mailboxes. With my truck backed into my driveway this camera, sitting on the dash would be about 10 feet from my neighbor's and my mailboxes. Plenty close enough with existing security lights to get a good recording of the people going through the mailboxes at night.
Because the USB cable is connected to the power wall wart and not a separate cable like with phone and tablet devices, I had to order a USB to power jack that will fit the camera so I could plug it into the truck USB power port.

Initial set up was pretty strait forward and easy by using the RJ45 connection to plug right into one of my switches. From there I was able to add my Wi-Fi hot spots quick and easy without messing with the scanning that most people use if they only have Wi-Fi in their house. While I waited for the additional USB cables to be delivered I put the camera in my garage looking out through the door window to run on Wi-Fi and test out how it worked with Blue Iris (it worked great), it's night vision, PTZ controls and general quality of the video. Every thing looked good and worked the way it was suppose to... for two days.

On the 3rd morning when I checked the video I found that it had turned to a gray screen with no video. It still seemed to be connected but the video was not being sent or at least not making it to the Reolink software application I was running. The camera was connected to a hot spot that was about 50 feet away and through a couple of walls running on 2.4GHz which had a full bar signal indication on the Wi-Fi signal status of the camera. I reset the camera but it would not re-connect, it just spun it's handshake indicator. I brought the camera to my desk and connected a Cat6 cable and it connected right away and showed a good picture again. I ran it for awhile with no problems. I switched it back to Wi-Fi and it would not connect to my EnGenius hot spot. I tried both 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz and neither one would connect.

I then enabled my Fios router hot spot which sits about 4 feet from me and where I had the camera sitting. It connected to 2.4GHz right away. So I moved the camera back to the spot looking out the garage door, about 25 feet away and through one wall and it wouldn't connect. I also tried 5.0GHz and it would not connect. When I placed the camera closer to the wall and about 12 feet from the hot spot, it connected right away on both 2.4 and 5.0. If I moved it another 10 feet it would not connect.

I went back and forth trying different positions and anything beyond about 12 to 15 feet from the hot spot going through a wall it would not connect. The wall is just a regular 2x4 stud wall with sheet rock panels on both sides. I can connect to a lap top, Surface Pro, Samsung phones, and iPad with no problems from either one of my two hot spots on both 2.4 and 5.0. I can power them off and they re-connect on start up without fail. If I do manage to get the E1 Pro connected and unplug it and plug it back in, it just keeps trying to reconnect until I move it closer to the inside wall closest to my hot spot.

It appears that the E1 Pro has a very poor antenna in it for picking up Wi-Fi signals. Which line of sight or close to a hot spot it appears to work, at least in the short amount of testing I did with this. But if there is any distance, walls or anything that will attenuate the signal it either won't connect or won't stay connected. This makes this camera unacceptable for any type of security use, even if I was only going to use it in my house I'd probably have to put a hot spot in the same room for reliability and if I'm going to do that I might as well use it with a network cable connected.

Since this camera does not work as well as it is suppose to, I have turned it to Amazon. I will say that the camera appears to be well made and does have good video and audio and would get 5 stars for that. I also contacted customer support about what USB power jack I needed to fit the camera and got back a reply within a few hours over the weekend. Very satisfied with customer support and 5 stars for them. My dissatisfaction is with how poorly the Wi-Fi works. I don't think it's defective, just a poor antenna system.",negative

Grandpa has seen every old film under the sun and wants to see the new stuff. Enter in us getting him a new tv that connects to the internet and allows connections to subscription streaming services like Netflix, Amazon prime video, etc. But the problem is that it’s new technology, so he will get stuck trying to find the show he wants and won’t be able to do anything with the TV until a family member gets there.

Solution! Enter in the reolink and now family members can login and see the tv screen and him and direct him on what buttons to push to get the show(s) he wants.

Bonus points to reolink for also functioning as a way to monitor and ensure that if grandpa falls, we can see it and he can call out for help and we can talk to him through the reolink.

What is sad, and the reason why this product gets 4 stars, is that the talking that one can do through the device doesn’t always go through and is annoyingly delayed. I want to say that this is an internet issue and not a reolink issue, but the internet is otherwise secure and fast. Wish I could give it 4.5, but .5s aren’t a thing here.",positive

It has day vision and night vision and night vision without infrared. Night vision without infrared works well while behind glass. The one I got had a few flaws but Reolink has sent me a replacement. So far tech support has gone well but slow. Mostly handled by email but they did call me several times to try to resolve the flaws. Connecting to more than one network requires entering the password every time you try to switch to another network. If you do it while both networks are available (such as connecting to a hotspot) it’s easy but if they’re not available at the same time then a complete reset is necessary. The flaws and the network password issue are the only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5. If the replacement works as good as I hope then I would recommend this camera to anyone. Picture quality is definitely great.

Update: Got the replacement 2 1/2 weeks ago. All the same glitches as the 1st one. Wifi occasionally disconnects, motion videos sometimes are 0 or 2 seconds long and often not accessible. Reboots seem to help but video quality and optional functions are great. 4mp video quality option is amazing. Still give it a 4 star.",positive

Configuration on the other hand, not so much. If using the camera with default settings works for you then this should be fine. If on the other hand you want to tweak the settings for direction, sensitivity, and amotion alerting, then you might want to opt for a better camera.
I'm seeing a lack of fine movement control for precise directional aiming. Sensitivity setting seem to be more off/on than a gradient as the setting is laid out as when an alert happens there is never anything in the captured image. Seems to lack the ability to set motion detection to a specific area of the viewed frame. There isn't a zoom button per se, instead it uses the 2-finger pinch on the phone screen to zoom in so on a non-touch display what you see is what you get. May be one, but I haven't found it yet.

Unfortunately for my intended use, the glass reflects so much of the infrared light that I only get interference from the reflection, and no worthwhile night image. The camera movement control is a bit jerky and hard to pinpoint accurately. A positive is that the company does provide free cloud storage (limited), so it is easy to go back and review video capturing activity.

After finally getting it setup and screwed into light socket, the camera positioning was not centered. I had to unscrew it some out of the light socket so I could have full side to side and centered front view. Right after installing it, we had a wicked thunderstorm and lightning/rain plays havoc with the motion detector, thus amount of alerts were insane. There is a sensitivity range (L-M-H) but if set in low, then you're changing sensitivity to what you're trying to sense...visitors. Plus it kept turning itself to the rear so the view was the wall. I tried to get it to stay faced forward but every lightning strike it would turn right back to the rear. I finally had to shut the power off to it. To say the least, it's being returned.

173,Camera & Photo Products,Dome camera1,$26.99 - $33.99,5,"Just got this camera in today, so far so good it's working just as it's supposed to. I ran it indoors for it's initial setup and to test the IR functionality before mounting it outside on the front porch, it's far superior to my current 10+year old security camera setup.
It was extremely easy to get set up and the recommended app is fairly straight forward.
One thing to note is to set it's ""home"" position you need to either manually position the gimble where you want it before powering it up or use the app to position the cam where you want it then kill power to it. When power is restored, it will return to that position after scanning.
This cam comes with a mounting base as well so it's not reatricted to an existing light socket. It doesn't come with a power cord but one can be easily made from an extension cord if you have even the most basic understanding of electricity.
I have noticed there is abour 2 seconds of lag which makes moving the cam on the gimble not very precise but for the price point it's an excellent value.

*update after a few days use*

A big issue the manufacturer needs to address is fixing the ""home"" setting for the motion control feature. It's an easy firmware fix on their end, what I have found is the cam tends to eveventually lock it's self 180 degrees from the home setting after several motion alerts, doesn't return to the set ""home"" position after several motion tracking events. This issue being fixed will be what encourages or discourages me from buying more of these cams.",positive

We’d been talking about getting cameras as there are condos going up across from our home which brings lots of new faces on our street. After we were robbed, I went on a deep dive into the home cameras and ended up with 2 brands. Turns out we’re keeping both, and here’s what we loved about these:

• Night vision is crystal clear. Even after washing the carport and forgetting to clean off the lenses, you could still see perfectly.

• Installation was a breeze

• There is a circle of LED lights surrounding the cameras that can be set to strobe briefly when motion is detected. My main goal in purchasing cameras wasn’t to CATCH someone, but DETER them. (Plus it scares the vermin that mess with my plants at night 😇) .

• They also have an 🚨 alarm 🚨 sound you can manually set which is an added layer of ‘get-the-F-off-my-property-before-I release-the-sharks with-lasers-on-their-heads’.
**{you can’t set this feature for certain days/times, only manually, which is room for improvement that will surely be added at some point}**

• Multiple users in the house have access to the cameras/live feed/alerts/mic etc

🔸 things to consider 🔸
~ these aren’t wired, so eventually they will have to be charged. If you wanted cameras outside/away from electrical things that would need an electrical engineer to wire in a whole ass security system and for renters, this is actually a much easier system.

~ it uses recognition software to start detecting regular faces/vehicles. It will still alert you of their presence, but will indicate familiars with emoticons.

~ you can zoom in on the cameras but not rotate them. Mount them lower than you originally think so faces are clear even if someone is wearing a hat.

~ Like ALL of the home cameras on the market, keep in mind this is not a replacement for HOME SECURITY SYSTEMS. It’s meant to deter and be eyes/ears for your home, not partner with your local first responders/911

•• The Ring cameras have a neighborhood community that keeps you posted on break-ins etc, but here’s why I don’t care- that’s only for people with Ring Cameras, and doesn’t include all actual criminal incidents. My neighbor’s didn’t announce our break-in to the neighborhood so what’s the point other than more unnecessary anxiety. I want MY home and family safer and if you’re reading this, you do too. I already know there’s shady shitbags out there, and thanks to these cameras, they will know we can see them & will hopefully move on or get some Jesus or jail time or something.

I read lots of reviews and Most were positive so decided to give them a try. I’m glad I did. These cameras are awesome! They battery life is extremely long. I charged these to 100% before installing. I walk in and out of my front door numerous times a day (where I have one of my cameras) which makes the camera record numerous times, and is pretty active. It’s been almost a month now and it’s still at 80%. At this rate I can use this camera for 5 months straight before needing a charge. The back camera rarely gets any action (maybe one event a day) so I expect that one to last well over a year on a charge. As for the app. It is very well laid out and extremely user friendly. As for the camera. The quality when set to HD is amazing. It is crystal clear and I can even see license plates of cars in my neighbors driveway and my own. You can easily see faces of people walking up the sidewalk and such. The Audio is very crisp too. I have not tried to talk out of the camera yet so I can not speak on that feature yet. I also have not purchased any of the additional features the camera can do such as notifying your car if it’s an animal, car or person, so I also can not speak on that. My only complaint with the camera is it’s sensitivity. There are 3 levels of sensitivity (low, medium, high). At my front door I had to set my sensitivity to low because any small bug that flies anywhere in the cameras view will set it up and notify my phone. Even on the low sensitivity it still does this. The same goes for shadows. I have trees on the side of my driveway (outside of the view of the camera) and when any slight breeze picks up, the shadow of the leaves moving on the ground in the cameras view will set it off. Because of this I get about 45 notifications a day because of shadows moving and bugs…on the low sensitivity for movement. Other than this issue, the cameras are awesome and recommend to anyone who is thinking about buying them. I do plan on buying more for other angles of my house.",positive

I was also trying another very popular brand so I tested them at the same time - side by side - and these won, hands down - I sent the other cameras back. I love the 7 days of FREE cloud storage, and even if I do decide to go with the paid plan it is only like $3/month for up to 20 cameras! The competition is $3/month for ONE camera or $10/month for more than one camera. The video quality is actually better than expected. The app is easy to navigate. There are even sleep settings which allow me to have the indoor cameras sleep during the day while we are home working - you can even choose which days to use the sleep schedule. That was an unexpected bonus! You can also control which, if any, indicator lights come on with motion, so as not to alert that they are recording.
I do have a few recommendations that would make these cameras absolutely perfect, but they are so great already that I didn't deduct any stars.

1. Would be better if they could be magnetically mounted to be much quicker and easier to take down for charging.
2. Would be much better if they had a removable battery so we could have extra batteries to replace for charging so the camera isn't just out of commission during charging.
3. Would be nice if it integrated with Alexa.
4. Would love to see a doorbell version come out!

Overall, I am in love with these cameras. I originally tested 2 and already ordered 2 more. I have all of them indoors, but I will be ordering more for outside to replace the outdated cameras I currently have outside. Luckily, they also have a compatible solar panel, so that will be nice for the outdoor ones.",positive

This DZEES CG6 Security Camera product is a wireless WiFi camera that is fit for both outdoor and indoor use. It is IP65 rating, which means it gives protection against low pressure water jets from any direction. As well as condensation and water spray. It is 1080P HD and has both motion detection and night vision. It comes with two storage options, using a MicroSD Card and you can also purchase a subscription to a Cloud Service for storage. The camera also offers 2-Way Audio. The camera has an internal 5200 mAh Lithium-Ion battery that can last up to 90 days depending on usage. It also comes with an alarm option. All controllable/configurable by the app. The camera provide 110 degrees wide angle view.

I already have two DZEES Solar Powered Cameras and I love them. This camera is smaller than the solar powered version. The unit didn’t come with a charge on it. So I plugged it in and about 8 hours later it was fully charged. That was the only thing that took any time. I installed the pedestal mount and secured the camera in place. It took about 2 minutes to install. It took about 2 minutes to download the app and register. Once that occurs you can attempt to detect the camera once you turn it on. Pairing and configuration was intuitive and straight forward. I had a working camera and app in less than 5 minutes.

The camera resolution is quite nice for a wireless camera and in testing, all features and functions performed as expected. The camera will send a notification to your phone when it detects motion so you can check the app immediately and see what is going on. Also it saves the recordings or photos which are accessible from the app if you install a microSD Card. You are able to listen to an activity near the camera or talk to guests in the back yard. The volume is not very loud .. however, it is clear enough to be heard. The night vision has a 33’ range is relatively clear. The 1080P HD is also impressive for a wireless camera. The view does have a slight fish eye view to it.

If you like this camera, I definitely recommend the solar power version. There are a few things that I prefer about that model. For one, it comes with a solar panel to trickle charge the camera. It also has a slightly larger battery pack @ 6700 mAh. But my favorite feature of the solar panel version camera is that it has a magnetic mount and it has a spot light that can be configured to turn on if it detects motion. Of course, those features come at about a $30 higher asking price. But well worth it IMO.

The manufacturer offers a Lifetime Warranty on the product.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this. I received this product in exchange for an honest review. All in all, this is an amazing camera. It comes with an excellent quality picture and is absolutely wireless. One of the best remote cameras I have come across. Highly recommend this product for the price point. The Solar Panel Version is even more robust. I have not found a better camera for the money unless you require pan and tilt. This is one of my top picks for a stationary camera. All in all, Hope this information was helpful. [5 Stars]

This is my first Dzees camera, and I took more than two weeks to test it prior to this review.

The first camera I received had some problems, and wouldn’t download to my phone. Dzees support responded the following day and eventually determined that the camera was defective. They suggested I replace it through Amazon, and I did.

The camera mount is mostly plastic, but easy to adjust and lock down. It comes with a USB cord (A <=> micro) but no power brick. There are mounting holes on the bottom as well as the middle of the back to handle any mounting position.

On the bottom is a large, easy to open rubber cap. This covers the micro-USB charging connection, a reset button, a power button, and a micro SD slot for cards up to 128Gb.

There’s a QR code to the Dzees app in the manual, which is pretty well written and easy to follow. I plugged in my email address and gave the app permissions to store videos, and connect to my network. I was up and running in a few seconds.

The app is laid out well, and it’s fast. Really fast. When I click on a notification while connected to my own network, I’m watching the video in under two seconds. Some of my other brands take 8 to 10 seconds to play.

The picture is 1080P HD video, but you can set the camera for SD or HD images, or select Auto. To find that setting, go to Live view and then go fullscreen. There is a blue light that signals activity/recording, but you can turn that off in settings.

With a Subscription Pan, you can set Activity Zones to trigger, or keep the camera from triggering, notifications when motion happens. Without a Plan, you can only adjust sensitivity for the entire area. Having a Plan also allows for notifications that specify people or pets.

A 20 second video takes about 2MB which means you could store approximately 1,000 videos per Gb. Even without a plan, you can access all recorded video on the SD card from the App. I don’t know whether the camera will overwrite the oldest files, or just stop when it’s full.

The night vision function works very well, and you can adjust the light level necessary to trigger it. Battery and WiFi info including strength, MAC and IP address info is easy to find. Firmware can be updated from the app without removing the camera from it’s mount.

The mic is super sensitive, but sometimes it records ridiculously loud. A mouse fart can sound like a trumpet. I’ve recorded birds flying nearby, and they sounded like a dragon landing. Sensitive can be good, but crazy loud is annoying. Dzees could make this better.

With no plan at all, you get 7 days of free cloud storage, but no “Intelligent Notification” or “Activity Zone”. Intelligent Notification is a cloud service whereby the video is analyzed by the Dzees servers and they’ll mark your phone’s notification as a person, pet, or vehicle.

Activity Zone is the ability to customize an area for alerts. For example if a part of the lens sees road traffic but you only want to be alerted if someone is at your door, you need this service. The camera still records everything, but you’re only alerted if there is movement in the specific area you outlined.

Cloud Recording – No Plan - you get 7 days of free storage up to 1Gb. Basic – you get 15 days of storage up to 3Gb. Plus – 30 days of storage up to 5Gb. Pro – 60 days up to 10Gb. The device comes with a free 30 days of Motion Awareness, if you want it. Everything’s working perfectly, and I didn’t sign up for anything, so hopefully nothing changes at the end of 30 days.

This is currently my favorite camera. I do have others with slightly better sound quality and smoother recordings. But for the price, ease of setup, local storage, fast access, and stand-alone design (no hub needed), this is currently the one to beat.

Pros

=> Local storage using on-camera micro SD card up to 128Gb.
=> 7 Day FREE cloud storage, and other paid plans available. Plans allow for up to 20 cams.
=> Totally wireless, and no hub necessary – cameras individually connect to WiFi.
=> Excellent picture for both day and night.
=> Fast connection to video.
=> Two-way audio and siren so you can talk to or scare away visitors.

Cons

<= Battery is internal and can’t be swapped out.
<= Magnetic mounts are easier to remove and replace for battery charging.

Hope some of this helps.",positive

If you’re looking for an affordable security camera that doesn’t sacrifice quality this is the one. We bought three of them and would like to add more in the future. The camera has lots of options you can play with to how sensitive you want the motion detection to be, when you should be notified, how long would you like the video to record for. I like that it has the option to turn off the night vision if you want the camera to be more discreet in some cases. They also have excellent customer service that could help with best positions and angles or anything you may need help with. Great purchase!",positive

This company also sent me out a new camera ( at no charge )which so far has given me no issues. I also hooked up the camera to a solar panel to help with keeping the camera charged. I appreciate how this company handled my issues and you can tell they strive for great customer service.

Very disappointing purchase. From the beginning I have always had issues connecting to the internet while another camera I have in an even further location seems to always connect just fine. The battery life is incredibly fast and I couldn’t seem to keep up with charging it so I decided to purchase a solar panel. When taking the camera down to charge it ( yet again ) it no longer will connect to my internet and I cannot reset it or turn it off. This is an expensive product to just malfunction within such a short period of time. Had I known beforehand I would have returned and purchased the same kind of camera I have in my backyard that works beautifully. Waste of money!!!!!!",positive

I got these so I can move them around my property.

Customer service was needed and the problem was my Wi-Fi. A few weeks later, Stefan reached out to see if I needed any more help. I’m going to add that move to my own small business plan!

Photos, clear and crisp, show the great wide angle views. Will likely travel with one or more Dzees cameras in the future.

The instructions are written using poor grammar. You have to make sure not only are you connecting the camera to the 2.4GHz network, but your phone must be on the same network during set up. I don’t think it mentions that. My phone is typically on my 5G and my electronic wifi devices use the 2.4GHz.

If you accidentally get your wifi password or network name wrong it won’t connect and there is no prompt telling you why. It just keeps trying to connect. You have to go back and double check then go back to setup.

Overall the quality of the video is pretty good. Time will tell if this works well for me. I may come back here and update later.

Update #1 - quality is still good. The app is confusing and took trial and error to figure things out. I contacted support because my camera lost connection when I took it outside. After several hours of trial and error I got it working. I texted support but they did not respond until the next day. They were very nice and are sending me a second camera for free. I did find out you do have to set up and pay for separate cloud plans if you have multiple cameras.",positive

No issues whatsoever. Took about 2 minutes. And the picture quality is absolutely top rate- excellent! The night vision also comes in very clearly. Beautiful video quality. I had a problem getting my SD card to fit in the slot so I called the Help line. This very personable man answered right away- saw I was on an iPhone and told me to FaceTime. He was so patient with me while I ran around my house looking for where I had set down the micro sd card and he was so patient with me trying to FaceTime for him so he could see what I was doing. He was so helpful, friendly, understanding and stayed on the phone until I checked to make sure the camera could read the sd card I had installed.

I use them to check that the chickens are safe in the early evening when they should go in the coop to roost. If there is a problem I can see it on the cameras and go check on them in person. The fixed cameras are limited though because I can only see what the camera is set to see which is limiting. This camera was interesting to me because it can be controlled and moved from my phone. AND it was inexpensive. I decided to chance it and ordered one figuring I could return it if it didn't work.
Turns out it works great. Far easier to set up than my previous cameras. The camera has a speaker that gives you information as you set it up. I had just one issue but the tech support was texting me to ask if I liked the product.

I’m a little concerned it might be might be too easy for a person to unscrew it and walk away with it, but because it is inexpensive, I think it would be worth the risk. At the price, I was not expecting much but I was very surprised at how well its working. I have a few other Kasa cameras that I’ve been happy with, but I wanted something to fit a light socket. The camera itself seems of good quality and moves around fluidly and quietly, and works well. The video quality is very good and the low light images are very good, as good or maybe better than the Kasa cameras. The HoMeYe app functions OK, and because I’ve used the Kasa app and others, I was able to mostly figure it out. The apps big drawback is the English translations are not very good, and can be rather confusing. It does have some strengths over other camera apps I’ve used, my favorite thing about the camera is when using the live video viewing, there’s button that toggles between HD and “Fluent” (fluent??? I think maybe they intended it to be ‘fluid’? Anyway when the camera is in “Fluent”, the camera moves and scrolls around in a very natural and pleasing way, it makes it very easy to zip around and view everything in a 360 degree sphere. The HD mode is very slow and jerky. Other features like motion detection work more or less like other cameras.

I found this little camera on Amazon, at a great price and with good reviews. so, I went ahead and bought it.

The camera comes with a set of instructions, and a USB power adapter with approximately 6' of USB cable. To quickly test the camera operation, you will first plug in the camera and download the Osaio app as instructed in the manual. The app will take you through a registration process, and it will give you step by step instructions to add the proper camera model (P1) and then connect to your Wi-Fi network. You use the app to operate the camera using Wi-Fi, move the lens to different angles, change the motion and night vision settings, listen to the surroundings and use the microphone on your device to speak. I would recommends moving as far as possible from the camera while doing the tests to avoid hearing noisy feedback from your device's mic when it is too close to the camera speaker. Once you are comfortable with the location and operation of the camera, you have to decide whether or not you want to record any video.

The camera has several options to record video:
- Using your mobile device's video recording: You have to manually activate the recording through the mobile device using the app; the video obtained from the camera will record to your mobile device. This is not the optimal option because it has to be activated manually, and it consumes significant storage space from your device.
- Using a MicroSD card (not included): The camera has a MicroSD slot right below the lens. I would recommend placing a 64Gb or larger MicroSD storage card. With the MicroSD card inserted, you can record live video 24x7. When storage runs out, it will start overwriting on top of the oldest recordings on a continuous loop; no need to replace or add more storage.
- Using Osaio's cloud storage - This is a paid option, and it offers some additional services to the customer depending on how much you pay.

I purchased and added a MicroSD card to record video and audio. When I go out of town, I use my app with my mobile phone to watch my cat live and talk to him. I can also control the camera angle, zoom in and out and take quick snapshots or short videos from the app while I watch him. In addition, I can rewind to an earlier time to check on him at specific times, like when he's running to get his food at different times throughout the day. I can do this from anywhere at any time. Night vision works great as well. The camera detects light levels and sets the proper brightness automatically according to lighting.

I highly recommend this camera. It has all the basic features you need to view and record; it is simple to set up and use and it is quite reliable. The capability of using it from anywhere (from home or any other city) using a mobile device is one of the most useful features in my opinion.",positive

The case has a large front flap that's secured by a velcro strip.

The best thing, in my opinion, is that a loop on the back of the case lets you carry these binoculars on your belt. That makes them great to take along when hiking, backpacking, or just walking your dog around the neighborhood.

The bad...

My biggest pet peeve is you cannot turn off the camera without literally unplugging it. There is no option in thr app to do this at all. I plan on unplugging inside cams while not on vacation and leaving the ones facing outside on all the time. I find it too intrusive for a possible hacker to be looking at me in my own home.

There is no option to turn off audio. If you are recording....you must record both video and audio. My reasoning is that I have two of these facing outside but they are inside the house. Hence the audio is of us inside the.house but the video is of outside.

The pics are of right after I peeled the.sticker off the front of the camera. They are scratched. Not sure if it is just repackaged used or refurbished. One of the cameras had a previous owner nickname for the camera already on it when I linked it. Even.though it was.scratched.i didn't see any scratches on the actual lens or video output. This alone is why I gave it 4 stars.

There isn't a zoom option on the camera. You can zoom in but the camera itself is not zooming in. It just gets more pixelated. There is no movement of the camera via app. Once the cam is set that is where it is aimed until you move it again.

The cam sits on the base with a ball allowing full 360 rotation. However there is only up and down in which you can angle it. I needed to angle the cam 45° to the left AND 45° down which I had to make a custom piece of wood to acheive this.

The cam base has no screw holes for anchoring and only comes with a two sided sticky. Although the sticky tape is really good quality, it means you are permanently putting the camera in that spot allowing for a tough time installing the correct angles. After the first mishap, I ended up taping it to a small piece of wood in which I could move the wood around to get.the best angles and spots.

It isn't the greatest video.if you are pointing your cam outside a window. It has no eagle eye and only gets a good 15 feet in front of the cam. I can't even tell the license plate number from 20 feet away in front of the cam in pure daylight. But the video of 0 to 10 feet is amazing. Also if you angle the cam about 45° out a window the glare stops you from seeing anything. It has to be mostly pointing straight out the glass.

The cord is sufficient. It is long enough to place on the ceiling if it directly above an outlet. But I wanted to move the cords in a way that you didn't see them, so I bought 4 cheap extension cords at the dollar store. It would of helped if they were just a tad longer.

The motion sensor and sound sensor will take a screenshot at the moment it triggers. However to view the video of the that time I have to manually go into loop back and navigate to that timestamp. It would be nice if they had an option to go directly to the loop back time of the sensor is triggered.

The audio 2 way radio could be better. When you click to speak, you cannot hear what they are saying until you click our side off. It is NOT like zoom. You can hear but it is a little robot sounding. Fine for if your just telling an intruder that the police are on their way.

The good....

It has really good audio. You can hear eveyone in mint condition for at least 15 feet away.

Inside a building up to 10 to 15 feet it has really great video quality.

The app is pretty good. Allows pretty much everything you need to do. The only thing I wish I had the option to do is toggle.the camera on and off.

It has suburb detection for movement and sound alert. Amazing. It has levels of degree for both to adjust.

The notifications are perfect. On time.

I bought four 128 gb high write speed SanDisk SD cards and that was too much space. It appears that will last over a month of constant recording and audio. I wish I went with the 64gb. I aways go with SanDisk brand because off brand SD cards have failed a year after while I have never once ever had a SanDisk SD go bad. Usually they just get outdated by being too small of size at some point. I haven't had any issue with glitches or shudders movement on the SD card for play back.

I bought a set of 4 when it was on sale for 69.99 and I wish I bought 2 sets for 8 total cameras. I plan on buying more at some point. They are great for baby monitors, intruder securiry cams, outside cam if it is protected from rain, etc. The only thing they are not good at is if you want a cam to see far distances. This is a cam for living rooms or door fronts.

Will update as time progresses.

Edit: Not even a month after purchasing I used these cameras to give the police a timestamp for a hit and run on my parked car. This allowed them to quickly navigate with their cameras to cofirm and start the investigation at a faster rate. My camera you could not tell the license plate number, but you could tell the color of the truck, type of truck, sex of driver, ethnicity of driver, etc. all at 2:30AM. When I zoomed in on faces all I saw was a blur but I could tell that numerous people looked that direction when they heard it. So I know who are witnesses. I also was able to easily save the video, zoom in at certain times, etc. and easily put it on Facebook for sharing. The only thing I wish was it was able to read the license plate as that would of helped the investigation tremendously.",positive

Four cameras in the $100 range is incredible. The cameras are lightweight, and have decent resolution and auto-brightness functions, even in the dark. The app has basic functions like enabling motion detection and setting a timer.

A couple features not available at the time of purchase, that I know are available on a couple other higher-end cameras: motion detection thresholds (hence only 4 stars on motion detection; this is an easy fix! I hope LaView adds this in an app update), and motors to pan and tilt (just simply not available at this price range without sacrificing camera quality). I think LaView chose a good feature set overall.

Note: to connect via WiFi, click the button in the top-right that says ""QR Code"" and switch to EZ Mode. None of my cameras would connect using QR mode, but I've set up 3 with EZ Mode and assume the fourth will also work fine, but I'm keeping that as a spare. Would have been nice if this option was made clearer in the instructions, since I wasted a frustrating nearly an hour during two sessions trying to get the QR mode working.",positive

Update. I had a great experience with Customer Service. 1 camera would not power up and another had a bad microphone.

I've had them installed for about 3 months both in and outdoors.
The pros:
-You definitely get what you pay for, but they are getting the job done for the most.
-The picture quality is pretty good both day and night. Night time, it turns to black and white but in the light or daytime, the picture is in color.
-The audio is great.
-They are purposed for indoor use, I believe, however i have 2 installed outdoor and they have withstood light drizzle and frost.
-They are lightweight and I used stick strips to hold them onto the walls and they have yet to fall even the 2 outdoors (I live in an apartment).
-I think you can connect up to 6 at a time but it may be more, I can't find the manual at the moment and I dont see any info in the settings on the app.
-You can watch all views on the screen, they show up like thumbnails and it has an option to select a specific screen by tapping that screen twice, then you can switch back to multi view screens if needed.
-The LA View app was easy to connect and they connect easy to the wifi.
-They have a really good zoom feature on the screen, just enlarge the view to zoom.
-The microphone is muffled a bit but you can make out whats being said if you listen closely, its no 2 way talking, so if you speak through the phone the other person can hear you but you cannot hear them unless you release the mic.
-The audio feature also only streams the audio for whatever view/screen you're on.

The cons:
-They do not record continuously, I believe the longest recording I had was 2 hours and that sucks because I wanted to be able to record at all times if need be.
-The also do not record multiple views/screens, so you can only record 1 view at a time which also sucks.
-They often update or require an update and its random.
-There is about a 3-5 second delay in the view, so its not really real time but kinda is.
-The play back feature is useless if you don't record that view/screen, not sure why its there.
-The cameras only adjust up and down, not left to right and you can rotate the camera itself to make the picture sideways if need be.

Overall, they get the job done and add a sense of protection for me. I love being able to watch my place while I'm away. This is my first time purchasing video surveillance equipment, so I'm now understanding that I will need to spend more money if I want a better quality system. I plan to purchase 4 more so that I can install 8 of them into a property I just purchased. I wont be in the same state as my property so I need surveillance.",positive

They shipped fast, I believe I had them up for probably 2-3 days prior before we left. While we were gone the one in my basement stopped working. It was hot to the touch and I’m glad I had my brother go take a look at it for me. I just figured somehow it fell or unconnected from the wifi. I use the other two just around the house still in case we are gone and want to monitor the dogs, and the last one I use in my sons room as a baby monitor basically. He’s 5. I throw it on at night and I can hear if he’s calling for me in the middle of the night and it wakes me up. I also have weird anxiety so sometimes I put the motion sensor on because I feel like someone might try to steal my baby 🥴🥺 it also appeases my mind that I can see him shit and turn through out the night because before I was constantly making trips to his room to make sure he was still breathing… (his grandfather died in his sleep and so did one of my best friends-of course to epilepsy but my mind will never forget any sort of possibility) I also love that I can talk through it but it takes a very long time to switch between the talk and listen option due to it only having 1 mic.

I really wish the 4th camera stayed working! Definitely a bummer. I was going to message the seller when it happened, but it has since slipped my mind until now. For the price they get the job done for sure! Night vision is not perfect but satisfying. Not sure if someone entered your home at night and you would really be able to figure out who it was if you didn’t already know them.

232,Camera & Photo Products,"Nooie Baby Monitor, WiFi Pet Camera Indoor, 360-degree IP Camera, 1080P Home Security Camera, Motion Tracking, Super IR Night Vision, Compatible with Alexa, Two-Way Audio, Motion & Sound Detection",$42.49 - $94.99,5,"I have the Nooie 1080P indoor camera and I've been quite happy with it so I had to give this 360-degree model a try. It takes the features of the static camera and adds the ability to pan and tilt the camera either manually or you can enable motion tracking easily through the app. I wrote a review for the static camera and many of the features carry over including its great video quality so if you've read that review, some of this will seem familiar.

Setup -
Setup was very simple using your phone or tablet, running the free Nooie Cam app. You first need to verify that your phone is connected to the 2.4Ghz access point in your home where you will be using the camera. You then simply start the Nooie Cam app and select the +Camera button. You select the Nooie Cam 360 option and it will walk you through the remaining, simple steps. Basically, you assure the camera is on, enter the password for the wireless access point/router your phone is currently connected to (this is the same one you will be connecting the camera to), click Next, and a QR code appears on the screen of your phone. You now hold the screen of your phone in front of the Nooie camera's lens and it provides an audible tone and LED light indicator when it is finished reading the QR code. The app will now inform you that it is pairing and will begin a countdown. When complete, the app will inform you that pairing has completed. It's that simple.

Use -
Now that the camera has been added, you simply select it to view the camera. To hear audio from the camera, you select the speaker icon within the app and now you are able to see and hear what's going on around the camera. The camera also has a built-in speaker that allows you to press the microphone button within the app and then speak through it. This is very useful and/or just fun depending on where you locate the camera. For example, I have the camera in my living room where my cat typically spends a good part of her day. If you have cats, I'm guessing yours is similar where she doesn't have one place that she always lays within a room. She instead has multiple locations that she'll randomly select. With this 360 degree camera, either from home, from work, a restaurant, wherever I have WiFi or cellular access I can pan the camera from left to right and up or down. It's range is great where you can literally place the camera in the center of the room and, from the app, turn it from it's left side behind it all the way around front, through to the right side behind it just by swiping across the screen with the camera's image live the whole time. You can pan it around to see the entire room. Beyond this, you have the ability to tilt the camera up and down from the app as well by swiping up and down on the camera's image live. I can scan the room for my cat, locate her, and then touch the microphone to talk to her. Being a cat, she chooses whether she wants to respond or not. Sometimes her ears just perk up and she whines (which you can hear through the camera's built-in microphone), but other times she'll choose to walk over to the camera and give it some love. :)

If you choose to use the Motion Tracking feature, if your cat, or anything really, moves in front of the camera's lens, the camera will follow it. As the moving option moves close to the edge of the camera's current visibility, the camera will move to center the moving object within it's vew and continue doing this until the moving object either stops moving or moves behind something where the camera can no longer see it. One thing to note with automatic Motion Tracking is the camera can pan 360 degrees. If something moves and the camera ends up pointing in a different direction than the next moving object. The next moving option must move in front of the lens at some point for the camera to see it and start tracking it. Depending on where you mount the camera and your use, this may be fine or it may not. So, definitely think about this before placing the camera if you plan to enable Motion Tracking.

Video and audio can be recorded to either a microSD card or to the cloud. Cloud storage is a paid service. Given my usage, microSD recording is fine for me so I haven't tried the cloud storage option. MicroSD recordings are easily accessed through the app via a scrollable tape across the bottom of the screen. You select the day and then scroll through to the time you would like to view. If at any time you are viewing live video or recorded video from the app and you would like to save the video to your device, you simply press the camera icon on screen to set the start point, continue watching the video as it plays, and press the icon again when you'd like to stop and the video will be saved to your device. It's VERY easy!

Like other security cameras, you can also setup notifications based on sound and/or motion. This too is easy to configure by selecting None, Low, Medium, or High for each option and then selecting the timeframe that you would like to receive notifications. Note that you can enable disable notifications by day, but each day only has one start time and one end time that can be selected. Meaning, you cannot setup notifications from 8am-5pm and then again 10pm to midnight for the same day. You could do one or the other, but not both. I don't see this as a problem for me, but it's worth noting depending on your use case.

There are a few additional notable settings. First is the ability to enable/disable audio recording. I haven't done much testing with this, but I'd imagine this could save some space on your microSD card, allowing you to possibly record more video if disabled. Second is the ability to enable/disable the small LED light on the camera. If you placed the camera in a visible location in your home, you may want to disable the LED to avoid the distraction of it. Last, there is a Rotate Image option. So, if you need to mount the camera under an overhang, cabinet, etc., you can simple tap this button to flip the image for mounting the camera upside down and now viewing it live or recorded video will display right-side up.

Customer Service -
I reached out to Nooie's customer service prior to purchasing my previous camera as I had a number of questions. I received quick, thorough responses the same day, shortly after I had sent them. I worked with Julia who was great to work with. Very friendly, personable, and understanding. Julia's customer service was great and made the decision to purchase this camera a complete no-brainer. As I'm sure many of you know, when you have questions or something goes wrong you really find out what a company is made of. I'm happy to say Nooie's support is great! Regarding this camera, I had a few questions for Nooie support prior to purchasing it and received the same great, prompt responses. This proved even moreso that their support is great! It wasn't just a one time fluke with the first camera.

Summary -
This camera works great and has clear video. The two-way communication capability is an added bonus and could open up its use to more than just a security camera. It's ability to automatically track motion as well as it's ability to turn 360 degrees while automatically tracking motion and/or by manually swiping the screen coupled with it's low price point of under $40 makes this a great buy in my book! I am definitely glad that I added this camera to my home. It will work well keeping track of not only the cat, but I can see when my teenager comes and goes when I'm not home.",positive

I wanted something that was farily priced but still had the same features (if not more) as the products from the other manufacturers. This led me to one of their baby monitor cameras also known as the 360 cam. I initially purchased one to monitor my dad who was bed ridden so I could still keep an eye on him if I had to step out or leave the room for whatever. It helped tremendously and gave us such a peace of mind. In fact, I liked the 360 cam so much that I ended up buying another one so I could monitor my 3D printer. I use another ecosystem for my security concerns but I bought their outdoor Pro Cameras (I will put a review for that on a later date) to bolster my security camera setup so I am all in on the Nooie ecosystem.

Pros:
- Very easy setup. Took less than around 3 minutes to get it up and running
- Impressive range of motion, which is something even the biggest competitors don't have. Most of them don't even move so they pale in comparison to the amount of control with the Nooie 360 cam.
- The night vision is extremely quick to turn on (and off) and still maintains it's quality. The overall quality during night vision about average but that's still very good considering many camera can't get the nightvision to come out half decent.
- The price: it's very had to beat and the features make the camera ""budget"" only in price.
- The quality, fit, and finish is AMAZING. It is definitely on par with, if not better than products from those pricier companies
- The capability to mount it upside down on the ceiling makes it look very professional once installed and the ability for the camera not to move it's up and down makes it so you can mount it really anywhere from a countertop to a wall (like I did with my 3D camera) to the ceiling.
- The motion tracking is AMAZING

Cons:
- The app could use some improvement but the bigger they get and the more support they get from consumers like me will help them take their app to the next level
- Speaking of the app, the app can sometimes take a second to sync up with the cameras but this is rarely the case. It doesn't happen often but it will happen every now and then.
- The picture quality is great and more than sufficient for closer things but I noticed that the the resolution of things that are further than about 25 feet away isn't that great. However, that's why you can always upgrade to the 360 Cam 2. The original 360 cam wasn't really meant for things that are really far away.
- This is really nitpicking but I wish there were other mounting options provided from nooie like a suction cup or something to mount it on countertops or bookshelfs and things if that nature.",positive

I examined tons of different models from a variety of brands. This camera met all of my needs and is definitely the most bang for the buck. I caught a special Amazon ""Lightning Deal"" and got it for $32.99. With Dynamic Noise Reduction and Color Enhancement, the 1080p video quality is excellent. The night vision is nothing short of stunning. It uses ""Gamma Correction"", so the infrared images are not washed out or grainy and have plenty of contrast. The night vision literally looks as crisp, clear and clean as daylight, only in B&W. The camera is ridiculously easy to set up. Using a QR code was a brilliant idea. Just make sure you're on a 2.4 Ghz network for the setup and pairing process. This is only for the setup process. Once paired, you can switch your smartphone back to 5 Ghz, if you're using a dual-band router. The Nooie will remain connected to your 2.4 Ghz band. This is the #1 reason people give this camera negative reviews. They don't read the setup instructions and don't realize this. The built-in speaker is loud and clear. The microphone is sensitive enough to hear the faintest room activity through your phone. My router is about 20 ft. away from the camera, but it's on a different floor of my house. The connection is rock solid and stable. It's never lost connection. The camera will send alerts to your phone if it detects motion and/or sound. You can turn these features on/off, and even set a schedule for when to detect either. This way, the camera's not sending you alerts when you're home and within camera view. The motion tracking pan & tilt is whisper quiet, so as not to attract attention if recording a home intrusion. That, combined with the ability to deactivate the ""Status Light"" makes this unit stealthy. The app is well executed, includes all of the necessary features and yet is simplistic in design. The camera's design is inconspicuous and elegant. People have commented that it looks somewhat like an air freshener. I can see the resemblance. The entire base of the camera has a rubber ring, running the full circumference, so it stays put and won't mar your furniture. I honestly can't find one thing to complain about with this camera, and believe me, I've tried. So, if you're looking for an inexpensive, quality camera to monitor your baby, pet or house, look no further. Buy the Nooie Cam 360. You won't regret it!

Setup Tips:

If your first attempt to pair the camera with the app is unsuccessful, reset the camera first before trying again. There's a tiny pin hole on the body. Just insert a straightened paperclip into the hole and press for about two seconds.

I keep reading reviews complaining that this camera won't work on a 5GHz network. These people are obviously not very tech savvy. Otherwise, they would know the reason for this. The difference between 2.4 GHz and 5GHz is range and bandwidth. 5GHz provides a faster data transfer rate, but at a shorter distance. 2.4GHz offers a greater range, but at a slower speed. When talking about WiFi cameras, range is the primary concern, not speed. The wireless signal must penetrate through walls and/or floors. The data transfer speed (for this purpose) is irrelevant. You will not see any visible different between the two frequencies. As long as the video image is smooth and not choppy, the added speed of a 5GHz network offers no benefit. To the contrary, the decrease in range is a detriment. This is the reason every WiFi camera I've seen on Amazon, also only works on a 2.4GHz network.

Some people have stated that this camera will not connect to a dual-band router. This is NOT true. Most modern routers are dual-band. You have to know how to ""force"" your cellphone to connect (and stay connected) to only the 2.4GHz band during the pairing process. If your WiFi password for your 5GHz network is ""stored"" in your phone, you must select ""Forget Network"". This doesn't actually forget the network. It merely deletes the WiFi password for the 5GHz band. This forces the phone to only connect to the 2.4GHz band. Once camera pairing is complete, you can reverse that process if you'd like your phone to stay on the 5GHz band.

Usage Tips:

When manually panning the camera via the app, you can't touch the phone's screen and drag your finger ""in one motion"". It takes a second for the app to detect your finger. You have to touch the screen and give it a second to recognize your finger. Then, slowly drag your finger in the desired direction. Remember, this touch control command is being sent over a wireless network. It's not the same as a ""local"" touch command on a phone app, thus the added time needed.

Nooie Cam App:

I noticed a problem with the app disconnecting from the camera after being closed for several minutes. There were a few other minor bugs. I contacted Nooie Support and received a reply within hours. I was advised that they were aware of the issues and were working on fixes. There have been three updates to the app, including two beta releases, all within the last two weeks. I tested the different versions and reported back to Nooie Support. They addressed everything in a timely matter. Due to their quick reply and fixes, I didn't let this affect my rating of the camera. For anyone who isn't familiar with how beta versions work, here's the deal. Beta versions are still in the testing mode. The developers will collect input from actual users, implement fixes and test the final result. Only then, will it be released to the general public. This is a normal process with all software development. They'll likely make other tweaks and enhancements in future versions, so check Google Play and the App Store regularly.

He started falling after a recent stroke and it became necessary after a couple falls in the night to alert me if he's getting up. It's also nice to be able to keep an eye on him as I do other things around the house.

Setup for me was a snap and I had it up and running in about 5 minutes from the time I took it out of the box. The camera picture is very good during the day and decent at night. The night view is good but certainly is not as crisp as I would like it but 1080p can only do so good at night. The ability to move the camera around from the app is nice but it would be nice to be able to lock the camera in place via the app as to not move it accidentally. I accidentally move it frequently when getting texts and other notifications while in the app. Long story short the camera itself does a pretty good job of doing what it's suppose to. The cord is quite short so if your mounting high, have an outlet near or be prepared with an extension cord.

Now the app. Where do I start. It's functional but how good depends on your needs. I'll break down my issues each on it's own paragraph, app and camera.

There is no supported option to view this on the web from PC. There is however a work around. Download BlueStacks to your PC which is an Android emulator. Set it up with your Google account so you can download from the Play store. Download the Nooie app and create a NEW account with a NEW email or other email you already have. It just shouldn't be the same as the original email you have the cameras registered to. You can use the original email but you can only be logged in on 1 device at a time. A new account keeps you logged in on all devices. Follow the signup steps then invite yourself from the primary account. I know it's a pain but it works. iOS also has a emulator. I'm not familiar with those since I'm an Android user but it's an option for Apple users.

The biggest problem for me is not all motion is detected and alerted. I use the bathroom in the night and I enter the camera viewing area well inside the view area. The camera does not send a motion alert when I walk through which takes about 5 seconds from the first sign of me on the camera. This is on low and medium sensitivity but it should still detect an entire body moving. I'm not a small person. Ultimately I don't need it too right now and it still detects and alerts to my father if he gets up or even rolls over in his sleep as he is mostly centered in the camera view. My needs will eventually change what I use these cameras for so that's a negative for me.

I want it to record to SD card continuously until I stop the recording and it doesn't. Everytime I open the app it stops recording. I need to start recording again before leaving the app. Sometimes I forget and it's really annoying.

If I need to review past recordings it's a real pain. It gives a timeline by date and you have to go into the date and scroll to find what your looking for which can be a pain depending what your looking for. If your looking for something and don't know the date it recorded... May god help you in your quest to find it.

On a positive note if you get an alert you can view the alerts from WITHIN the app inbox and have it take you to what caused the alert. This is ONLY if you were recording. I suspect a lot of people don't know that from some of the bad reviews I read. I found this when I had a moth flying by the camera setting off motion alerts (even on low sensitivity). It had to fly right in front of the lense to set it off. Flying 3 feet in front of it didn't at low sensitivity. If you have alerts by sound detection then this will be more difficult for reasons mentioned below...unless the reason is a loud one.

The ability to share the camera view with others is a really nice feature. My father is getting home hospice care and it's nice to have family be able to give themselves piece of mind by checking in on him... especially the one that lives out of state and can't be here. The company states they can't adjust the camera but they definitely can move it. This is a big problem for me. They cannot adjust the settings but I have had to fix the view from them accidentally moving it many times. This would be another reason to be able to lock the position of the camera from within my app as the owner. It would also be nice for them to be able to control their own alerts with their app. Right now they are stuck with how I (as the owner) have it setup for me.

The 2 way audio is lacking for me. A family member was standing 5 feet in front of the camera and couldn't hear what I was saying to them, only that I was saying something. I don't talk softly so the built in speaker is a negative for me. The microphone is lacking as well but is more functional than the speaker. Room noise from anything more than 5 feet is not great. I was talking to a nurse 4 feet in front of the camera and my family watching could hear good but hearing the TV at 12ft is VERY faint, tinny and not distinguishable, even at a decent volume. Take that for what it's worth for your situation.

A missing feature that would be nice is being able to set a motion detection area for alerting. I was hoping this app would do that (not stated it does) but it doesn't.

I'll update as I think of other things, these were just off the top of my head. I just ordered another camera for another room even with my issues as now is not the time to reshop for a new brand of camera I would be happier with. The camera serves its primary purpose but it could do so much better with work to the app. I'll update for a 2 camera setup if needed but for now I would not recommend this camera.

UPDATE

2 camera setup has all the goods and bad mentioned for both cameras. I moved the primary camera watching my father to 5ft away from where he sleeps instead of 12ft away and false/no alerts are much better. So apparently alerts are only reliable within 5 or 6 feet of the motion.

I upgraded to the latest beta software to try and make things better and now I have connection problems. Sometimes it's slow to load video and sometimes it doesn't load at all. If your having connection problems then unsubscribe from being a beta tester in Google play and reimstall to see if it helps.

UPDATE 2

Ok I'm done. 1 of the cameras now disconnect randomly and needs to be unplugged and plugged back in to reset it to get it to work again. I wasn't wanting to find new cameras now but Nooie is just not cutting it so I will upgrade to a 2k camera from another company to provide the night details I would prefer and also get a more reliable camera.. The negatives are now drowning out the positives. Reducing to 2 stars.",negative

We set it up in our living room to test before baby comes. Images included are an evening with lights on and night time vision, which works really well. We tested sound detection, which worked right away, and motion detection. Motion detection did not pick up arm movements from me or my husband but did when I moved my leg. You can see in the image where we are sitting when we tested this. I believe when we have it pointing down into the crib and there is less in the video area, it should be better at detecting baby movement. There are different sensitivity levels to choose from and time frame you can set up to receive alerts during. You could also set the motion detection area. It is free to view live on the app but if you want recordings you will need to pay for the cloud, which there are several affordable options to choose from ranging from $1/month to $19/month (at least that's what they were when I looked). There is also a FB group where other Nooie users can discuss troubleshooting and all things Nooie that I have found helpful in setting up the camera and getting familiar with it.

After several commination via email back and forth to get it resolved, Nooie sent me the replacement cameras. I was really disappointed based on the review below because I stopped working under a year, and Nooie insisted on saying it's not compatible with my Wi-Fi which I know it's not true. It was working fine but corrupted randomly. It turned out that I received 1 in 1000 defected product.
When I received the 1st replacement, I installed and linked it immediately, and it's working perfectly and faster than the defected ones. I followed up with Nooie to let them know that is working fine so that they can send me the second replacement. I have installed both; one upstairs and one downstairs, and I also purchased their subscriptions as well.
Just FYI... if you purchase Nooie subscriptions, there are 2 types (24/7 recording or event recording). For the 24/7 recording, you don't have to turn on your Sound and Motion Detections, but with the even recording, you must turn on Sound and Motion Detections. If not, it will not pick up anything/recordings.

Bought it in Oct 2021, and 9 months later these two Nooie 360 cameras of mine is no longer working. Literally, work up this morning without knowing the cameras are not working. The camera list was gone. My babies were crying without me knowing it because the damn cameras didn’t work. Now don’t even mention my darn wifi, I have good wifi signal all around the house and I will even get wifi when I’m outside close to 100 feet away. I have tried so many times to reconnect my two cameras. I reset it multiple of times, and still not hope. I paid about $100 for these two because it was 2 for $80+ bucks.

I used to have the other types which has one monitor and two cameras, but it can’t connect with your phone and my son broke it. I wanted this because it’s “360 degrees” and you can connect to your phone so that I can access anywhere when the grandparents or anyones watching the kids. Customer service is suck to be honest. It takes them more than 24 hours to respond to you. They don’t call just messages.

I must say for the ones who purchased and still have no problem, I must say I am amazed. Again, I have tried all can of ways to resolve this on my own, but I have no hope whatsoever.",positive

After I set it up, I ordered the second one right away! I even got the third one for my parent! This is the best camera I have ever tried on and had!

It is very easy to set up and only took me like 1 or 2 minutes to do it. The app is also very simple to understand! Because I am taking care of 2 kids by myself, and since they both are very young, I need a camera that can follow them and I can watch them from far away while I do the house chores!

This camera allows me to talk to the kids, back and forth! It is very good at detecting motion and sounds! I even put the motion in low sensitivity, but it still detects very well! Also, I don’t need to move the camera angle from the app, the camera itself can detect well and help me to follow them very well! My son even found it fun and played with it! The best part is that it allows you to set the time of the notification! So I won’t get butch of notification while I am in the zone!

Tbest part of app is that I can put all the screens of my camera in one screen, so I can fully control of where my kids go!!! I really love this!

Lastly, the customer service are the best I have ever had! They replied fast and solved my concern right away! So far I really enjoy the cameras! And I won’t worry a thing about this camera, since the customer service will solve my problem fast and well!

From the start I only wanted to deal with one ‘system’ i.e. one app, one interface…. And I did consider things like the doorbell cameras but all that seemed difficult to install (besides they are really large!). And I did want to be able to get ‘alerts’ for motion or sound, as well as – for the nanny cam - the ability to remotely move it around. And I absolutely did not want to have to sign up for a subscription service / monthly fee. Hunting around and reading reviews I ran across the Nooie. Nanny and Security cams at a very reasonable price. And no mandatory subscription service. Their write up on their website and attractive price with some good reviews as well as alert & remote control led me to get the Nooie 360.
I was thoroughly impressed!

From the excellent packaging (really world class, think of Apple products), to their ease of set up (uses a Q-code), to easy to use and intuitive interface, to the clever engineering, to the smooth styling, the folks at Nooie clearly hit the mark of their “mission to simplify” using “warm tech”.
Since this I have added in their outdoor security camera. Again, what a GREAT product at a price point that makes me wonder how other folks are selling anything at all!

And their tech support is excellent. I did have an issue outside of warranty but the Nooie folks were on it and 100% resolved the situation.",positive

But, I wanted to try these out and wow, I am impressed. You can see a side by side of the Tapo camera vs. the Wyze camera (first generation).

The resolution is better on the Tapo camera, that’s a given. You can see more details so it’s especially useful when you want to Zoom in.

Interestingly enough, the Tapo camera seems a little “zoomed out” than the Wyze camera and sees a slightly wider view. I don’t think this makes a major difference though.

The color and lighting is also much more accurate than the Wyze camera. I have no idea why everything looks bright and blurry in the Wyze camera. All the shades were down and no lights were on so, that was weird to me.

The setup process was slightly quicker than the Wyze cameras. Not a huge difference, maybe one or two more steps. But, it was super easy.

252,Camera & Photo Products,Light Bulb Camera,$47.99,5,"I posted the review (see below) with my thoughts about this product. I have a lot more updated details to provide...fortunately for the positive!!

The seller contacted me directly through Amazon messaging to address my concerns.

1) The seller was extremely apologetic about the issues that I posted about the discrepancy between the manual and the online posting about what memory card is needed. To be clear...it is a MICRO SD card, not a regular SD card.

2) The micro SD card should be 64 GB to 128 GB; either will work with this camera. The manual states 64GB, but the seller has stated that the camera will support up to 128 GB (which is what I am using)...and it works perfectly!

3) The IR lens only shines for the first 2 seconds of the powering up sequence...not constantly. I was looking at the IR lens after those initial 2 seconds and did not see the stated light. It is there...you just have to look quickly after turning on the power.

4) I am a US resident. I don't know if that has any bearing on the following comments. I have installed multiple smart wifi light switches, power plugs, security cameras, etc. in our home. I have always scanned the QR code with my iPhone app scanning the QR code on the security device. I have never scanned using the security device to scan the QR code that was posted on my iPhone. That was my difference with this product. The QR code is literally on your iPhone (or Android), and you hold that phone QR code in front of the security camera...and the camera will then scan the code on your phone and set everything up immediately.

It literally took me 3 seconds to go through the setup process once I understood that the security camera needed to scan the QR code on my phone, not the other way around.

The seller has stated that they have posted an additional instructional video to help everyone with their installation. I appreciate all their efforts. I remain amazed at their reaching out to me personally via Amazon email. And I appreciate their efforts.

My cameras were literally installed within minutes once I understood the process and realized I had read the instruction manual incorrectly...the cameras work great with wonderful clarity. I can highly recommend both the cameras and the support I have received from the seller.

Original Post:

I am frustrated beyond belief and hoping that the seller will see this review and give some helpful advice.

1) The product description specifically stated micro SD card, which I bought only to discover that a standard SD card is what is needed. I have lots of those from my photography hobby.

2) The manual specifically states that the maximum capacity of the SD card is 64GB. But the seller states here in his answers to various questions that an SD card up to 128GB will work.

3) The manual states ""Power the camera, and you can see the IR Lens glowing and hear the power-on bell."" There is no glowing IR Lens on either of the 2 cameras I purchased, and there is no bell...only an annoying voice that is beyond impossible to understand.

4) The description and the manual state that 2.4ghz wifi is all that this camera will work with. I have set up a specific 2.4ghz band, logged on to that band with my iPhone, and tried to do the setup. Even though I have given the Tuya Smart app access to my camera, there is never a successful scan of the QR code of either camera...using both the front and rear cameras just to be sure I tried everything. While trying to scan the QR code, the camera repeatedly (like every 20 seconds) says something that sounds like ""Please configure your iPhone"" or something similar sounding...that has to be the most annoying thing when I'm trying to do the best I can with the instructions provided...and nothing is working...and the camera keeps telling me to configure my phone or whatever it's saying, every 20 seconds.

If I could get it to connect to the app, maybe I could forgive all the other inconsistencies...but so far, after a couple of hours of wifi setup and camera / app work, I have been completely unsuccessful. I wrote to the customer service address on the manual only to have them promptly reply with a bunch of online support links that I had already researched and read.

One more day...a few more tries because I'm stubborn...and if I'm still unsuccessful, these 2 cameras and the wrong microSD cards are going back to Amazon.",positive
253,Camera & Photo Products,Light Bulb Camera,$47.99,4,"Great security for the price and ease of use. It is much nicer to just screw this in and go through the couple extra steps to have a security camera rather than having to wire security cameras. Only thing that i am not impressed with is the motion tracking and motion detection alerts. If you have this next to any window it for some reason cannot stop from turning to look at it, it probably sees reflections from the window and thinks it’s movement possibly? The window has blinds on the other side so don’t worry it’s not trying to spy in the house. Also if you want this to be able to turn on when you go out in front of it it’ll usually work but getting it to automatically turn off is troublesome. Im not sure if it keeps detecting more motion or if the bugs being attracted to the light and flying in front of it is causing it to still detect motion. And the actual motion tracking is pretty lack luster, if you go slightly faster than a fast walk and it will lose you. It being able to take a micro sd for storage is nice but you should probably pay the extra $5 or so a month for video cloud saves incase somebody steals the camera. And it’s $5 per camera a month. But the option for 24/7 recording is VERY nice.

The guy at the call center hung up on me because I asked him to phonetically spell the website he wanted me to go to, I couldn’t understand a word he was saying due to his accent so it was hard to hear the name of the website he wanted me to go to, I asked him if he could spell the sites name and he did. But then I couldn’t audibly decipher which letters he was saying. I kindly asked him if he could spell it phonetically, but he got frustrated with my request. I explained that over the phone it’s hard to decipher if someone is saying E, T, or D so I asked again if he could spell it phonetically and I gave an example “A as in apple, B as in ball” he got frustrated again and hung up. So I emailed the company asking for help and they gave me a tip to try and when it didn’t work they recommended I return the device.

255,Camera & Photo Products,Light Bulb Camera,$47.99,3,"First things first, make sure you have 2.4 Wi-Fi or else it won’t connect to your network. That also means the device being used to control the camera has to be on the same 2.4 network. At times I have issues with signal strength and disconnections to other devices so I only use this setting when I need it. The sound quality is spectacular. The app takes a little getting use to but once set up I was impressed. I’ve had other cameras but this little bulb picks up everything around you, possibly a little too much though. I was surprised to see better, clearer and more detailed pictures than ADT. There aren’t any glitches or delays unless you live beside a very busy highway, with active train tracks. The night vision is just as good. I see everything just as clear as I saw it during the day. This is worth the money as long as you’re okay without automatic live recording. You are given options in the app to get notifications if it detects any motion, sound and human body but it will not record the activity as it’s happening. That was an issue for me. Fortunately, there are multiple pictures captured of incidents. It is very sensitive to sounds and motion. Overall this camera is very detailed. Zoom in and out has never been this good with other cameras I’ve had. If you live in the country on a long back road with distance from your neighbors this is the perfect camera for you. I love it!

Cons: Software App does not correspond to manual or video entirely.
When you hit record icon, camera will not record continuously and to SD Card. If you leave record on and hit the icon, it only records short video clips to your gallery. Useless for 24 hour video playback. Live only viewing. Software is glitchy. The feature button does not work and other icons aren't responsive. to get back into features like color mode etc, I have to go back to the phone Tuya App and restart the App again for the feature page to appear. The manual isn't that great. On the App Camera and Lock is the category you need for set up. It's about half way down the page which is stupid. The manual and video use a different category. The manual says to go to dual bad wave and you need to go to camera and use the reset pin Then hold the QRS code to activate it after it loads the signal beep ad install accept beep. Had to keep entering wifi password every time till it took. You have to hit the carry on button. I find my self constantly hitting the back button to the Camera App because the screen likes to freeze. If you go to your phone menu to do something else the phone app shuts the recording off. Its only good for live viewing if you want to stare at a camera all day. Forget eve buying a Micro SD card. I use a Samsung Pro Endurance Card made for Cameras and it is a waste of a good card. Luckily, I only use it for my garage door to see if it opens or closes from another room and see through the garage widows if there is a car in the drive. The camera is at the top of my steps to the house and I can view the whole garage. If I wrote the manual you could understand it . After Installing the camera and the app it had an Update and it wipes the camera clean and you have to do the Install all over again! If you can avoid light bulb cameras , do it. This will only work with a cloud service! Hopefully!",negative
257,Camera & Photo Products,Light Bulb Camera,$47.99,3,"I bought 2 of these bulb cameras but returned them because I could not turn off the camera light on one of the units. I tried every solution that had previously been posted by the seller but none of them worked. I could not find any way to contact the seller.
The installation instructions are very poor. The seller must have recognized this and produced an installation video. The video is too casual and poorly presented. This is the first product I have purchased that is run by a phone app that has the QR Code displayed on the phone screen captured by the camera lens for pairing.The seller does not emphasize this clearly in either the installation booklet or video.",fair
258,Camera & Photo Products,Light Bulb Camera,$47.99,5,"I give the camera 5 stars, but the app you have to use only 3 stars.

The camera is easy to set up and install. The pictures are very clear. I’ve put them in my front porch and garage light sockets. Much easier than the old Nest cameras I had. Much less expensive too.

Since I had the dedicated Nest app prior, the Tuya app isn’t as user friendly. It is used for a multitude of products. The picture just shows one page of one example, electric. You basically have to use trial and error to set up for recorded use. I’m still working on it. I do like that you use your finger on the app picture to move the camera in 4 directions.",positive

262,Camera & Photo Products,"Gskyer Telescope, 70mm Aperture 400mm AZ Mount Astronomical Refracting Telescope for Kids Beginners - Travel Telescope with Carry Bag, Phone Adapter and Wireless Remote",$89.99,5,"I bought this knowing nothing about telescopes and not knowing what I could expect to see through this thing.

Now I know more, I think this is a decent value, but it comes with A LOT of cons.

In telescopes, the aperture size matters much more than magnification. The bigger the aperture, the better the image will be. This is a 70mm aperture (2.75 inches), which is about as small as you can get. It's typical for an ""entry-level"" telescope, and a decent value for the money if you want to get into stargazing without dropping 500 bucks or more on a bigger scope.

However, if I could do it over again, I would've spent more and gone with a better one.

First, as with all beginner telescopes, it is actually much harder to use than a more intermediate level one. This is something well-known in the amateur astronomy group I've joined, and they never, EVER recommend buying a beginner telescope, ESPECIALLY for kids.

Because most kids like looking AT stuff more than looking FOR it. And with this telescope, far more time is spent hunting for objects than actually looking at them.

My kid doesn't have the patience or attention span for that, but I rather enjoy the challenge, so I do it. Which brings me to the next problem.

This is made for kids. As such, the stand is very short. Which means that all the time you spend hunting for things, you'll having to be hunched over, crouched down, or kneeling on the ground.

And if you live in a place with a lot of light pollution, you won't be able to see much more than stars, the Moon, or the brightest planets. Even Mars is difficult to see through this telescope, and you can't make out any detail whatsoever on the surface.

You can make out SOME faint detail on Jupiter, especially if you go away from light pollution on a clear, moonless night. And you can just make out Saturn's rings.

Venus, on the other hand, is very easy to see. Especially now, near the end of April 2020, it is the brightest it'll be all year, so we've been looking at it every night. It's too bright, even at its dimmest, to make out any detail, but you can see what phase it's in.

Galaxies, most nebulas, and many star clusters are beyond the ability of this telescope, but that being said, I was able to see a planetary nebula called The Ghost of Jupiter last night.

For perspective, I've had a few weeks of use and practice, and feel comfortable with the telescope, and have a number of apps, charts, and star maps to help me find things, and it STILL took over an hour for me to finally find it, put it close enough to the center of my field of view to use with max magnification, and put it in focus.

And even then, it looked like a hazy, bluish star. We couldn't make out any detail or the distinctive eye-shape that can be seen with even slightly larger scopes.

Still, it was cool and the kid loved it. I consider it worth the effort, but my back is killing me today.

Don't get me wrong, for an entry-level telescope, this is good. It'll serve our needs while we save up for an upgrade. But, like all entry-level telescopes, this is harder to use and not powerful enough to see much.

All the time required to hunt for things, for what many may consider a disappointing result, could potentially end up killing a kid's enthusiasm.

If you absolutely MUST get an entry-level telescope, this is a good choice. But if at all possible, save up and get a larger aperture.",positive

It is constantly readjusting focus and seems to never get that, I have only been out at night a few times with the camera and it works well but there is quite a lot of adjusting necessary to get a good picture.

The plan was to capture the event nightly from December 19 through December 22.

Receiving and unboxing the telescope was pretty straightforward. The instructions were somewhat trying, but given that there were only a few ""moving parts"" it was easy enough to figure out. The only problem we encountered was that the adapter for allowing the telescope to connect to a smartphone was missing half of the adapter and we could not connect a phone to the telescope. No idea why the part was missing. We unboxed the telescope on our dining room table and when we discovered the part was missing we had no less than 5 adults searching for it, to no avail. We didn't lose the part, we just never had it. That was disappointing when you consider that being able to attach a phone was one of the primary reasons for selecting Gysker and we lost our opportunity for the grandkids to record their witness of the grand event.

Setting that bit aside, the telescope worked wonderfully. It was easy to set up, with all of the [available] parts fitting nicely into the supplied carrying case. We transported the telescope to our observation area and the telescope set up easily. The 'spotter' scope allowed us to get on target quickly and the aperture and zoom features allowed for a spectacular view, including many of the moons surrounding the planets. We even used the spotting scope and a smartphone app to align the telescope with other stars for equally breathtaking views and we spent about 2.5 hours searching out various objects in the night sky each time we went out. (From dark until bedtime).

The grandkids (10, 9 and 7) really took to the telescope, learning how to use the various parts and functions rather quickly, even to the point that they could select and observe a star on their own. The tripod was solid and held a stable image and everything, sans phone adapter, worked very well.

If I was rating just the telescope on cost to function-ability, I would rate the Gysker telescope 10 stars. It is a very good telescope for the money and since we wanted the kids to get excited about the night sky, this was a great purchase. The ONLY disappointment was because I specifically chose this telescope because we could attach a smartphone to record an event that only happens every 800 years and then was unable to do exactly that, well, it was a real letdown.

Even at that, I would tell anyone wanting to start amateur exploration of the sky that this is still a great telescope for the money.",positive
