0,Apps & Games,Minecraft,$6.99,4,"I have been play Minecraft since the beginning of 2022 I luv this game! I stared out as a slow gamer. Small houses and dying multiple times. But now I'm building big houses surviving. Fighting mobs. Finding diamonds. And very soon I'm going to get Java on my laptop. I have learned so much! Thank for being a awesome game.
Here are some updates I want badly.
1. Sharks whales jellyfish. And more sea creatures.
2. Make villagers look boys and girls.
3. make girl zombies
4. Add fireflies
5. Make it so on bedrock edition you can hold torch and other stuff in off hand
6. Make more skins free.
7. Make it so you can search the skin you want.
8. Make shaders free and already In game.
9. Add more animals. Like Jaguar and tigers and lions and bears OH MY!
10. On Character customization make more clothes free.
That's really it! Hope you enjoy the game as much as I do!

1,Apps & Games,Minecraft,$6.99,5,"hardlyre probably reading this because you heard rumors about this super awesome game called Minecraft, and you want to check it out yourself. Well if you do spend it the $7.99 to buy this game then that will be the best $7.99 spent in your entire life. If you search google for what are most popular games on the planet then Minecraft would be on that list. It's basically you're in a world and you're surrounded by blocks and pixels. And you have to try to survive by getting materials and stuff. But when the sun sets monsters come out and try to kill you. You can also go to the End and the Nether and fight bosses and stuff. There is also creative mode where you can fly around and build whatever you want. Your friends can join you too if they have Minecraft and you can all build together!!! Minecraft can be played on: Computer, IPad, IPhone, Kindlefire, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo DS, Xbox, And PS.
There are also mods created by other Minecraft players that can make the game more interesting. The only thing I would change about Minecraft Is that they'd add Hardcore mode to bedrock edition. 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000/5 Stars!",positive
2,Apps & Games,Minecraft,$6.99,4,Online doesn't work because my fire tablet can't handle it but still I like it. I have a TNT mod and it works but I need to not through to much dnt or it will turn of and some of the other mods I downloaded don't work and because I said some of them don't work you might think the rest of them do but the rest of them don't becase the rest of them are for Minecraft PE and I don't have that so you might think why did I download it if it's for Minecraft PE but when I downloaded it I did not know it was for Minecraft PE I knew when I started playing it.,positive
3,Apps & Games,Minecraft,$6.99,4,"I love this game and everything about it and ive been playing sence 2016. But there's one thing, i can NOT update it.

9,Apps & Games,Minecraft,$6.99,5,"Minecraft is an extremely fun game to play with friends and family, its sparks creativity and I have been plays by it for years. Just $20 has changed my entire life, for the better. Here are reasons why you should download:
1.) Minecraft is a fun interactive game that is constantly changing, he w updates add more features and generally make the game more interesting and exciting, as of now (1.17) the added plenty of new features with huge plans in advance, I rate this feature 10/10.
2.) Minecraft is easy to play and connect with freinds, There is servers and every seed (world generation code thingy) changes the generation creating a unique experience for every server. I rate this 10/10
3.) Minecraft have many exciting mobs (or animals/monsters) to battle, farm, care for, etc. The vast majority of the game has exciting animals that each serve a purpose, weather it's trapping a friend or making new ones, the mobs play a role in an exciting experience. I rate this 9/10.
4.) Minecraft has several different blocks that serve not only an aesthetic pupose, but an important purpose in making a dream come true! I rate this 10/10.
5.) Minecraft has several different modes that your character can be on, these include, survival, creative, and adventure. Each of these creates an entirely different experience for the player and I will list each one of these below.
Creative: creative mode is a mode that makes you indestructible, and allows you to fly around, you have every block in the game accessible to you and you can spawn every animal/monster. You can also build as much as you want as you are not constrained by material limits. I rate this feature 10/10
Survival: this is the main game mode were you have health hunger and limited resources, this is best for survivalist and for people looking for an adventure! This is the main way to beat the game and gives you plenty of access to unlimited amounts of fun! I rate this feature 10/10.
Adventure: this is a masochistics dream, you can't build (unless on a special block called an allow block) or break anything, its perfect for playing maps (e.g. cube craft, mineplex, etc. etc...) You can make it so that people cannot destroy your builds and so you can make fun and interesting games. I rate this feature 9/10.
6.) Commands, Minecraft has a special block that allows you to write in a form of code and allows you to do stuff you normally wouldn't be able to do. I love using command blocks to make interesting features and there is SO much potential once you learn the fundamentals. To use command your going to need to go into the chat, and type / this will give you access to most of the commands, one command allows you to do all of the commands, type in the chat /give @s command_block 1. This will give you a command block giving you access to every single command.
7.) Preformance, Minecraft's performance is decent as long as you have a good device and internet, however there is one block that crashes your game when you have to much, that's tnt, you light it and you may not only blow up the area but your device. I rate the preformance 7/10.

Key: 1 updates, 2 world generation, 3 mobs, 4 blocks, 5 game modes, 6 commands, 7 performance. In total I rate this game 90 Kjillion Out of 10",positive

33,Apps & Games,Scary Teacher 3D,$0.99,4,I love this game but there are bugs like when you are going upstairs from the basement your head pops out and when you are in a specific room you can parlour your way up and stick your head through the ceiling. Also it would be cool if you could explore the neighborhood more. Miss t can't see you through glass. I also think they should be able for to play everything without spending anything except for the game itself. And sometimes miss t can see you through walls. Needs more chapters too. And the pranks are a little hard sometimes too as they give you so little direction on what your supposed to do. Good game overall the design needs tweaking too needs better graphics.

92,Apps & Games,Five Nights at Freddy's,$2.99,5,"I actually liked this and found it to be an entertaining, well-spent game. However, if you do NOT enjoy scary games, or find discomfort whilst playing them, I do not recommend you buy this unless you are up to the challenge. For those of you posting reviews that this game is overly scary, you shouldn't have bought it despite the warnings, as this game was specifically designed to be scary. For those of you saying it's boring or not scary, you need to learn to appreciate a good game, as I've seen ones worse than this. As for the crashing, I'm not sure, but I haven't really had any problems with it so far, well, for me. This game could be easy or very difficult, depending on you. If it is easy, you can always do night 6 or see if you can do the custom night with all on extreme. If it's too hard, I recommend reading some of these tips.
TIPS: (If you don't want help, just ignore this..)
Bonnie The Rabbit-Night 1+: She/he?... is the most active animatronic of the game, mostly for earlier nights but throughout the entire game. (At least for me.) Bonnie can also disable the camera, during which can teleport, but Foxy can also move during this. Bonnie can only enter through your left door, so it's good to regularly check your left light. For me, cameras weren't that useful, as all I needed to check was my left light, but it's still good to know where they are. Bonnie can appear on any left-side camera except Foxy's one. Upon discovering Bonnie while checking your light, don't panic and immediately close your door. Bonnie has a longer reaction time and is generally quick to leave. If you see a shadow, Bonnie is still there. If you don't, I would open my door to conserve energy, but keep in mind Bonnie can show up anywhere at anytime.
Chica The Chicken-Night 1+: She is similar to Bonnie, but is still different. She isn't very active, more common on later nights. I don't often see her on Night 1, but it is still quite possible. Despite being less active, she commonly lingers by your door longer, draining your power. You can also check for her using your light, but if you see her and close your door, instead of a shadow you can see her through the window. She will enter through your right door instead of left. Her route she will follow will go from Show Stage Cam 1A to Dining Area Cam 1B to Restrooms Cam 7 to Kitchen Cam 6 to East Hall cameras 4A-4B, since only Bonnie can teleport. If you hear banging pots and pans in the kitchen, it's a sign Chica is there. She has a shorter reaction time than Bonnie, so be sure close the door quicker.
Foxy The Pirate-Night 2+: He is more unique from the others. He may seem inactive, but is a great threat. He is located in camera 1C, and starts out behind the curtains, but, with your camera, if you check him too little, he'll slowly come out. However, on later nights, if you check him too much, he will also start to come out. Perhaps check on him about every once every 3 times you open your camera. Well, it depends on how often you open your camera. This coming out has four stages. He begins with closed curtains, then peeks his head out, then appears to have his whole body out, then is completely gone, which is when the sign may change to ""IT'S ME"". Be more cautious after each stage, as it means he is closer to coming out. Should you check up on him and find the last stage, as fast as you can, DO NOT change cameras, close your camera and shut your left door, that's where he always enters from. Wait until you hear three knocks and three footsteps and open it. He has just sprinted through the hallway and took some of your power. The amount taken starts at 1% and increases by 5% each time, so try not to check him too much or little. He can also barge through your left door on Night 1 if you stand idle for a while or never check your camera. Otherwise, it's really rare.
Freddy the Bear-Night 4+: The main animatronic and a strong threat. On the first 2 nights, he will stay in the Show Stage, Cam 1A. On the 3rd night, he will wander. You may hear laughter and music from the kitchen, but he doesn't attack until night 4. He follows the same route Chica does, but rarely backtracks or wanders, unlike Chica or Bonnie. When you run out of power, Freddy will peek at you from the left door. You then have anywhere from about 15-50 seconds before death. Average is 32. There's nothing you can do during this but wait, but try not to move, as it may speed it up. Freddy enters from the right door, but like Foxy, checking your light won't help. Freddy also likes the dark, so he is hard to spot, but you may see white eyes. In the dining room, check for white eyes in the back. In the kitchen, listen for his music. (Not Foxy's singing, real music.) If you hear it, he's in the kitchen. He will laugh every time he moves. If he laughs and there is no music in the kitchen, check East Hall Corner. If he is there, immediately close your camera and shut the right door, and wait for two more laughs until you hear him retreating. It's good to keep an eye on him if you want to survive him. If you close both doors when not necessary, he can get you.
Golden Freddy: Like an Easter Egg of the game. In West Hall Corner, you may see him on any night, but most commonly the 1st or 3rd nights. Try to avoid checking this unless you really want to see him. If you do see him and close your camera, he will be in your room. After a few seconds, he will kill you and most likely crash your game. If you see him in your room, just put up your camera and he will disappear.
Just try to remain cool throughout gameplay, check your cameras, check your
lights, and only close your door if needed, opening up as soon as safe. I would only keep my cameras up a few seconds at a time, same with lights. Also, it helps to close your right door every time before checking your camera. (Freddy.) I myself use lights for Chica and Bonnie and cameras for Foxy and Freddy. If Chica or Bonnie sneak in, you will either die or they will disable the right or left doors and lights. It is worth the money if you enjoy it like I do. (Meh I write wayyyyy too much)",positive
93,Apps & Games,Five Nights at Freddy's,$2.99,5,"Bonnie the Bunny- Bonnie comes out on all of the nights, including the first night. On the first night, the animatronics give you some time to get used to the game. Bonnie comes out from 2-4 in the morning. On later nights, 12 in the morning. He can disable the camera if you check it too much. Bonnie can also teleport, and can appear on any left-sided camera except Foxy's camera. If you searched every camera and Bonnie isn't there, check the left light. If he is there, do NOT hesitate, and immediately close the door. If you turn on the light, you can see a shadow through the door. If you turn on the light and you don't see a shadow, open the door to conserve energy.
Chica the Chicken- Chica can come out on any night at 4 in the morning, to 1 in the morning on later nights. She can appear on any right-sided camera except Foxy's camera. She will enter through the right door. If you turn on the right light and see her, close the door. She will take quicker to kill you, but lingers by the door longer, draining you power.
Foxy the Pirate- Foxy doesn't come out on the first night. He comes out only depending on how much you check your camera. On early nights (like the 2nd and 3rd), he comes out the less you check your camera. On later nights (like the 4th and 5th nights), he comes out the MORE you check your cameras. Here are the stages to avoid:
He starts out behind the curtains, then sticks his whole head out, then his whole body, and finally is gone, and the sign says, &#34;IT'S ME!&#34; When you see that, slam the left door down.
Freddy Fazbear- Freddy wanders on the third night, but doesn't attack until the fourth night. He likes the dark, so he will be hard to see. Also, listen for his music. Not Foxy. He also laughs every time he moves. If you see him in the East Hall, close the camera immediately and shut the right door.
Golden Freddy- Golden Freddy is also known as Yellow Bear. He is located in West Hall, and he spawns on the fifth night.",positive

95,Apps & Games,Five Nights at Freddy's,$2.99,5,"I know the truth. All from the bite of 87 to who is purple guys real identity... (All credit goes to gametheory) But first this is a reveiw not a gametheory episode so firstly Great game! üòÇ secondly THE TRUTH... Mangle probobaly caused the bite of 87 because 1. She attacks you RIGHT where your frontal lobe is. 2. The paycheck shows that the year is 1992 because its the 22nd of november and the mangle must have been used as the. ite long before. secondly fnaf 1-3 is a DREAM because those animatronics in fnaf 2 are inspired by the plushies and TOYs in the Fnaf 4 minigame. anybody notice the Toy animitronics in fnaf 2 are inspired by the plastic toys in fnaf 2. Not convinced? Notice how toy chica llses her beak every time she leaves the show stage? And do you notic how the Toy Chica toy in fnaf 4 has no beak?üòà The original fnaf modules were inspired by the plushies in the crying childs room and foxy is out of order in fnaf 1 because foxys head is missing in the crying childs room. Spring trap was inspired by the finger trap from the little girl in fnaf 4. and william afton is the crying childs father. the evidence is that ugly lamp william (the player in Fnaf Sister location) has in his house matches the lamp from the hallway to the crying childs room. now remember pig tail girl from fnaf4 in that minigame? she was turned into and possesed BABY. Notice in the fnaf 4 trailer how baby says don't hold it against us over and over? and remember that faint You don't know what we've been through at the end of the trailer? well that references to fnaf4 because pigtail girl goes to possess baby but pigtail girl is the crying childs brother... The evidence is when we can explore the house in the fnaf4 minigames. She knows what the child has been through in those nights so she tells him what happens if he's caught. and the child is the victim of the bite of 83 (the year is 1983 because you can turn on the tv and it says fredbear and freinds 1983) he was bitten by fredbear and he died in the hospital (you can brighten the room to find a iv drip bag.) that child is moarning the loss of her brother and she betrays her father later in sister location (sister'S location?) by going to see baby then dying in the metal grip if babys uh... Stomach claw thingy. she whats to Avenge her brother. now william afton moarned over the lose of his son too. so he tries the unthinkable. he kidnaps children then test them with robots in a rage to bring back his child. he knows these robots come to life at night. the evidence is in the blue brints of the animatronics which the stomach of funtime freddy is a body shaped stomach. Conincidence? I don't shink so. dozens opon dozens of children were tested on robots . no wonder these robots want to kill william afton so much! any ways these robots want to get out of sister location. and remember the secret private room from night 5 in sister location? well if you type in 1983 it shows security of the crying childs house. and remember night 2 and the breaker room? the map shows grey areas that will look very vamiliar to fnaf fans... plushtrap hall way andthe crying childs bedroom. and those security cameras geuss who has the remote to them? none othed then sycic freind fredbear. and just so you know the normal fred bear caused the bite of 83. those animstronics want out of sister location. and luckily for them they're way out walks so willingly into his death spot. and remember those blue prints? baby and ballora have voice mimicing and evasion. it says so in the blue prints. and remember the fnaf sister location teaser theres a little bit of me in everyone? it shows ennard. and My hunch is the animatronics build ennard with there parts to escape. ennard uses the voice replication to replicate baby's voice and uses ballora's evasion technology to evade you while talking to you. he tricks you right into the scooping room, holows out your body, and puts him self inside you. poor william. or acctually I don't know if I should be sorry because william afton is purple guy. the book fnaf: silver eyes reveals that willaim afton is purple guy. But thats just a theory. a GAME theory! wait! game theory has a copy right!?! oh ok. remember theory is not fact. you can beleive what you want but we think this explains the most and makes the most sense.‚ò∫üòÅ I hope you found this help full!",positive

224,Apps & Games,Toca Life: Neighborhood,$3.99,4,"Welcome to PeytonPlays guys! I got this game three days ago. It looked really really fun! It was. But then I was looking behind all the paintings and I found a Quija board. Those really scare me.üò¨ and those boards are evil. They are bad. Like really bad!! Toca boca, what were you thinking? Little kids could see that and think it's ok. Toca boca, I'm dead serious. You better get rid of this. I mean, I know that you use that board and the crystal ball to Summon a sloth ghost (which I absolutely love!!!) But can't you just do the crystal ball and that little pink crystal instead???? Please?? It makes me really uncomfortable. I tried to throw it away but always, it came back. I wish when you throw away something it would stay there and if you want to bring some thing back from the trash, there should be a button to do that. But, back to the game, I love it. I think there should be more stuff but it's fun! (By the way, to get into the club part of the robot cafe is to open that big metal thing at the back of the cafe and put all of the things on purple triangle. I know it sounds confusing but, just do it and you'll understand.) This game is a lot more fun on toca boca life world. So, yeah! Also toca boca, you should make a toca boca life mall (a bunch of things you find in a mall) toca life space station (first you can be on earth with your family, then at NASA, then you get in the rocket and go to another planet and you find aliens etc.) To a life creation (you make your own world and toca people and let's etc.) Toca life conection ( you go online with other people and you can chat and play toca life games.) And toca life America. (You can like move all over the country with your toca person family and there will be stuff that the state's actually have like the white house etc.) Thanks for reading guys.

284,Apps & Games,Toca Life: Vacation,$3.99,5,"My daughter and I love this! The game is super cute, fun, and age appropriate (my daughter is 4 years old).

This game really gets my daughter's imagination churning. There are many different rooms/scenarios for her to play in and a wide variety of characters to role play with.

My daughter and I love being able to pretend and interact with each other, since two people can play this together (on one device). We like how the food and drinks seem to refill within a few minutes of being used. Sometimes we do have to exit the room, go to the main screen/map, and then enter the room again to get more food/drinks for our characters. If that doesn't work or we want to clean up/restore the game, we just press and hold down the circular/round arrow button at the top, right hand side of the screen. Pushing that button restores everything to the way it was when we originally installed and played the game for the first time.

My daughter really enjoys pretending to take a flight at the airport, staying at the hotel, and swimming at the beach.

This game installed smoothly and works well on our android device.

I hope everyone enjoys this game as much as we do. :)",positive

A weird part about the app is inside the airport there for some reason is a bag of poop and it makes a little trail of it I also love that cute little park with like a money thing a little shop with like hats and jewelry it's just so cute that they're actually pretty cool if they had like a hotel with the swimming pool but it doesn't because that beach is pretty cool anyway,positive

You can create different characters and adjust each and every thing about them. You can change their height, clothes, and features. And don't think its one of those little kid dress up games. There's more to it and the animation is super cool. This game is for most ages. There are some clothes that show more, so probably not for like, a really little kid, but they don't show anything bad.

While the real game is like a 10/10 in Android or Apple, I'll list the things I hated in the fire edition:
1. This version costs money.
2. While I made OC's, the game would crash. Therefore, not saving my OC's
3. The Pop-up Ads. Another annoying thing I get while I try making OC's is weird FNF ads. Luckily you can exit out, but its so annoying since it fills the entire screen.

321,Apps & Games,PJ Masks‚Ñ¢: Moonlight Heroes,$6.49,5,"Cute little game. Very easy for young ones to figure out and master. Very simple ""controls."" You just tap or release (do nothing) to get each character to do what they need to. Theres only a few levels for each character and the goal is to catch as many orbs as possible. More orbs, more points. There really aren't many obstacles, so this adds to the simplicity and ease of the game and makes it good for toddlers.

Owlette flies her way through her levels to collect the orbs. I'd say of all 3, she is the hardest character to control or maneuver... not that she's even hard, but just in comparison to the other two, and it's only because you tap, but not hold, to make her fly. Tap more rapidly to make her go higher and then do nothing to let her down a little and so on. There are buildings, so you have to get up over them and then down. Orbs can be up or down as well. She takes a little more time to master, as she requires several taps whereas the other two only need a single tap for them to do what they need to, to navigate and collect orbs.

Catboy runs through his levels and must jump over things, jump over gaps between buildings, jump over what looks to me like exhaust units on top of the buildings, and jump for orbs, of course. When you get the logo orb you have super speed for a while and this is with all 3 characters.

Gecko jumps and sticks to the walls. Tap to jump up and stick upside down and crawl and then when you have an obstacle you simply tap once again to jump down and stick to the ground and crawl. So, essentially you just need to tap once when you have an obstacle and he will go up or down and that's that. The orbs are in between and so sometimes you tap once just to drop and collect, or go up and collect. Easy.

The only obstacles for all the characters are the buildings themselves which you jump or fly over, the exhaust units (or whatever they are?) And then there are like fireball type things that come at you every now and then and they just push you back a little or slow you down.. they don't make you lose a life/turn.

You pass each level no matter what and advance to the next. Your goal is simply your best score.

The graphics are great and it's a great quality app. It is an official app and not something a random person created, so it is as good as it can get as far as graphics and audio.

It's a really cute game. If you have a PJ MASKS fan, you need this game. The 3 yr old here loves it. He plays it and doesnt get frustrated with it. It's easy for the toddlers but fun for the older ones too. I played through each level of each character, as well. I suppose I am a Masks fan myself. Cute little trio, they are, but I must admit that, that little Romeo cracks me up with his giggly snide-ness and silly names for his inventions... tracker whacker, sniffer whiffer... just cracks me up, along with his voice in general. Doesn't take much to amuse me, I guess. He is not in the game though, and neither is Luna.

Now, we need the toys to be released!! Creating a high demand for the holiday season, it seems.",positive

Speaking of the artwork, as the title suggests, I thought it was so adorable that it actually hurt a little. It was a nice distraction while it lasted and I especially liked the baby snake and the strange little spider. Having said that though, if you have a child that is highly sensitive to emotional reactions - like, say, the kind that might start crying if they hear a soft lullaby or is particularly effected by facial expressions, this app might disturb them, as all of the animals make such faces of adoration when you tend to them that it might effect their sensitivities. I am aware this is not a common trait among kids, but having known kids like this and having been one myself, I have no trouble imagining those images might impact a small child like this in a more drastic way than is common.

413,Apps & Games,Toca Pet Doctor,$3.99,5,"This is another great app from Toca Boca. Everything this developer has put out is cute, easy and fun.
Don't get me wrong, these are all very simple apps, they are designed for young children. They help children develop fine motor skills, and learn to use apps.

I love them for my daughter with special needs. There are fun sounds which engage her. She gets visual and auditory feedback for playing with the app.

I've mainly had these apps on the ipad my daughter uses, but whenever Amazon has had one as the FAOTD I make sure to snag a copy.

From just the few minutes I looked at this app with her it does require a bit more interaction that the original Toca Doctor app (this I guess could be considered a sequel ?).
the little egg you have to help the animal hatch from required quite a few taps (almost like a jigsaw puzzle).

I look forward to more from this developer. (and despite my kissing their butt, I can assure you I'm just a regular user - they are just one of a very small handful of developers that are pure gold in my book)",positive

You choose an animal, cure them they way it tells you to, feed them exactly what it tells you to, then it falls asleep and you pick another animal until you've cured them all.

It could have been so much more interactive! It would be nice if there was something more interactive about determining what is wrong with an animal, a choice of cures, or even a choice of food to feed them.

A younger child or toddler could probably play this for hours, but for an older child, expect them to think it's cute at first, but expect boredom later on!",fair

I really like Toca Boca games. They are extremely kid friendly, and while this game is for younger kids, my 8-year-old is still excited to play this game occasionally.

The thing with this game is, you go through the same waiting room full of pets with the same set of problems over and over if you play more than once. That CAN get boring. But, this game did hold the interest of my kids for a long time.",positive

442,Apps & Games,Sonic The Hedgehog 2,$2.99,4,"Dear Sega, this remastered game for people and mobile is really good! But you need to make it so that the last boss is easier for Knuckles because he jumps 1 block lower than Sonic and Miles/Tails do, and I don't have a strategy other than measuring my jumps. But guess what, I can't because of Knuckles not being able to jump high enough! So change this feature, please and thank you!",positive
443,Apps & Games,Sonic The Hedgehog 2,$2.99,5,"Now it's worth mentioning that, while Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a nigh-undisputed classic as it stands (enemy placement issues in Metropolis Zone aside, because those badniks can seriously get bent), this mobile version was rebuilt from the ground up by the same Christian Whitehead and collaborators that were responsible for the fantastic rebuild of Sonic CD that was released on PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, and Steam. Unfortunately, at the time of this review, Whitehead's rebuilds of Sonic 1 and Sonic 2 are mobile-exclusive, having been developed at a time when SEGA was still under a timed exclusivity agreement with Nintendo as far as the Sonic the Hedgehog series went--an agreement that produced Sonic Lost World for the Wii U and moved Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric away from the more powerful consoles it was originally being designed for (which is part of the reason it's such a technical mess).

Sonic 2 in particular is notable in its rebuilt form for more than just the absolutely flawless recreation of the original gameplay, but also for the much smoother-animated Special Stages (a trait Sonic CD shared as well) and for the inclusion of an extra level, Hidden Palace Zone. This zone, featuring a wholly original layout and a new boss fight against Dr. Eggman, is accessed by intentionally jumping down what is infamously known by Sonic fans as ""The Pit"" in Mystic Cave Zone, a deep, deep deathtrap which in the original game had spikes at the bottom instead of an actual bottomless pit, meaning if you jumped down in Super Sonic form, you'd be trapped there until your rings drained away and then you would die. The spikes have been removed and the pit now acts as a secret transition to Hidden Palace, the most well-known of the stages that were cut from Sonic 2 during development. Also hidden within the game is Proto Palace Zone, a technically ""finished"" recreation of the original Hidden Palace Zone contained in Sonic 2's beta version.

This is a really cool extra and for long-time Sonic fans especially, a very charming addition to the rebuild.

There is only one drawback to this title and that is the platform on which you must play it. Touch-screen control for Sonic the Hedgehog games very hit-or-miss depending upon the player; I myself have difficulty playing any kind of game without tactile feedback. I haven't been able to test Sonic 2 with a gamepad-grip mobile accessory attachment, and can't confirm whether or not that's a viable alternative to touch play. If you're used to touch-screen control, you probably won't have a problem getting used to it, but even then your fingers inevitably obscure a portion of the screen. This doesn't really hurt the overall product--and I'm not a fan of docking points for an inevitable aspect of playing a game on a given platform. But I felt this was worth an advisory note at the least.

If this version of the game were every to be released on consoles or PC, however, it would be hands-down the definitive way to experience the 90s classic, something that can be said for the other Christian Whitehead rebuilds as well. I seriously hope they make a similar rebuild of Sonic 3 & Knuckles to complete the classic series. That would just make my millennium.",positive
