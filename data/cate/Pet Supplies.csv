0,Pet Supplies,Dr. Elsey's Cat Litter,$10.99 - $65.93,5,"Cat litter.

It's dusty. Dusty and gray. Also, granular. Decidedly less so upon being used, it forms a foul smelling hillock that waits for the low-man-on-the-totem-pole of the household to reluctantly scoop it. It smells of...cat litter? What else does cat litter smell like? I dunno. It's the medium in which we expect our pet cats to expel their waste.

That's it.

That's about as much brain real estate each of us has devoted to the rousing topic of ""Cat litter"" and deservedly so. Cat litter is one of those things that is so inconsequential in our lives, so banal of a product, that any amount of conversational effort devoted to it is too much. That is, when it works.

And yet...here I am reviewing it on Amazon.

In addition to having a decent (boring?) enough of a life that I can devote time to reviewing cat litter on Amazon, I have two cats. One is a white flame-point ragdoll cat that is the reincarnation of Steve McQueen that'll befriend a Rottweiler within minutes of meeting (Tucker) and the other is a painfully shy siamese that closely resembles a raccoon that swallowed a medicine ball - we call her ""the basement troll"" for her penchant for cool, dark spaces and cardboard boxes. Formally, however, she is known as ""Bailey"".

While Bailey is extremely sweet, she's very nervous and scares extremely easily. She hides in the basement whenever anyone comes to the house and hates being carried. While Tucker is as cool as Billy Dee Williams and makes the Dos Equis guy look like Don Knotts, Bailey is more sensitive than an open cavity. As a result, she's suffered from chronic bladder infections for years.

While both of these cats are polar opposites of each other, both had one thing in common - they both had a penchant for leaving tootsie rolls just outside of their litterbox. In addition, because Bailey suffered from routine bladder infections, we were starting to see rust-colored spots in not-so-inconspicous places around the house (essentially every carpeted corner in the house). While I certainly don't condone the tendency for families to throw their hands up in the air in exasperation and send their pet cat straight to the kennel when this happens, I can understand how it happens.

If only there was some sort of miracle product that keeps such tragedies from happening...

Yes, Precious Cat Ultra Premium Clumping Cat Litter is that product. How incredible is this stuff you ask? I'll tell you: it's so damned good that here I am, semi-supine in my cozy bed on the last Tuesday before Christmas and instead of figuring out how I'm going to get every last gift that I'm obligated to buy, I'm reviewing this cat litter. That's how f---ing great this stuff is. It's simply sublime - transcendent even. In a world where every product is so over-hyped, brightly packaged, and intrusively advertised on every screen in your house and yet is woefully and ultimately ineffectual, here's a product that's the equivalent of a circa 1974 George Foreman right cross packaged in a manila envelope.

Before I continue, I would just like to say that this isn't one of those inane, dipsh-t ""ironic"" reviews that self-entertained hipsters write in the hopes that they get recognized by Buzzfeed - I'm as sincere as I can be - this is the Alpha and Omega of cat litter.

With that out of the way, the first thing that comes to mind about this litter is that it saved our carpets, piles of dirty laundry and sanity from Bailey's sketchy bladder. Cynical as I am, I was fully expecting the worst for Bailey - her bladder infections were a more consistent recidivist than Tyron Biggums and there was no end in sight. Like seemingly all pet ailments, I was fully expecting Bailey's treatment to be outrageously expensive.

Thankfully, we're blessed with a vet that had long since paid off her exorbitant student loans and rather than recommend more ""tests"" (i.e. $$$$), she recommended Precious Cat Litter. Always in favor of the cheapest, easiest, and simplest answer, I happily ordered it from Amazon. I replaced all the litter in the house (Tidy Cat) with the Precious Cat stuff and was ill prepared with how fast I saw results. Literally minutes later, there were fresh clumps in one of the litter boxes. Both cats took to this stuff like a fish to water. No longer do we find ""surprises"" propped up against the litter box when it comes time to clean them out and that's pretty damned nice.

So, I give this stuff an easy 5 stars right off the bat due to its ability to coax Bailey to start using the litter box again, and thereby curing her bladder infections for good. That alone makes this a 5 star product. It fully exceeded my expectations. What really makes this stuff special is the comorbidity of the following:

1.) Cost - This litter is significantly cheaper than the major brands you see in large jugs at just about every supermarket in the country. For the longest time I couldn't understand why cat litter was so expensive - I mean it's not like clay and ""proprietary scent crystals"" are rare earth metals. Precious Cat Litter brings sanity back to cat litter pricing. It's also pretty sweet that a 40lb. bag of this stuff ships with free 2 day shipping with an Amazon Prime subscription. Thus, the value proposition is off the charts with this litter.

2.) Scent - There is none.

No, I'm not just talking about the actual scent of the litter - I'm talking about after it's been used. Bullsh-t you say? I can't blame you - every friggin' litter I've ever used that advertised such a claim has failed miserably. Cat urine is so putrid and so powerful that it causes many landlords to refuse cats to be present on their premises. I wish I had known about this product years ago because it effectively renders this objection null and void. The way this stuff absolutely smothers cat urine smells is positively game-changing. We have four cat litter boxes in our house - one is in the upstairs laundry room right at the top of the stairs. Normal cat litters would assault the olfactory senses of any poor soul unfortunate enough to walk upstairs in our house. Not so with this litter.

It's ability to c-o-m-p-l-e-t-e-l-y void the stench of cat urine is truly other-worldly, maybe even a little bit spooky. Absolutely nothing should work this well at canceling out one of the worst smells known to the human race. Thus, I have no other choice than to conclude that simple logic dictates that Beelzebub himself MUST be involved somewhere in the supply chain of this product - there's no way humans alone have unlocked the superpower of neutering cat urine funk. However, this raises a philosophical question unto itself - how bad could the devil really be if he/she/it is involved with such a flawless product? Eh? Think about it.

So, Precious Cat litter is not only super good at eliminating cat urine stench, but it also forces consumers to deeply ponder some of life's most mysterious philosophical questions. Tidy Cat don't do that, jus sayin'...

3.) Clumping performance - To me, next to the puke-inducing smell of cat urine, scooping soggy piles of cat mess is the absolute worst part of changing the litter box. With the mainstream brands, I've noticed there's about a 50:50 chance that the litter will clump. When it does, things are a-okay. When it doesn't, you might as well don a painter's mask and goggles to deal with the resulting acrid fumes. Once again, Precious Cat punches far above its weight here. This stuff clumps so consistently and so tightly that Detroit should consider using this stuff to fill potholes. Cleaning the litter box with Precious Cat is a much faster, much easier, and much less painful experience than ever.

So, I conclude my review. Is Precious Cat a fantastic cat litter? Indeed. However, it's something better than that - it's a product that transcends its meager goals, which is to merely be a substance that cats crap into. For one, it's absolutely unmatched in its ability to do what no other cat litter can do, namely ""leave no trace"" that a cat resides in your house, a ""silent warrior"" if you will. Yes, I said it - it's essentially the Navy SeALs of cat litter. It's also cheaper than its inept competitors. Perhaps most importantly, it can be the difference between a cat being happy and comfortable in a loving home and a cat finding itself in a shelter. Lastly, it's so outstanding that after witnessing its perfection, you'll be highly motivated to write paragraphs about it on Amazon.

1,Pet Supplies,Dr. Elsey's Cat Litter,$10.99 - $65.93,5,"This product is unscented, but completely masks scent. Even the waste bin I fill after scooping the litter box doesn’t stink as bad as the last litter I used. Very fast clumping. Very low dust. I use this stuff with confidence in the litter box in my kitchen, without fear of contaminating all my surfaces with litter dust.

Almost no tracking. I would wager the only tracking that happens is when I accidentally step on the stuff with my bare feet as I’m cleaning up after they kick it out of the box. My cats are champion kickers, so they do still manage to kick it outside the box a little, but not much, and it doesn’t fly far. I use a litter mat under one of my boxes and it keeps it almost completely contained (have I mentioned my cats being strong kickers?).

Half the cost of the “no dust” clay litter from Arm & Hammer, but works MUCH better. Does not stick to the walls of the litter box! This is really important because my kitty tends to urinate down the wall of her box all the time. Other litters would clump and harden on the box wall and stick there. Couldn’t scrape them completely off if I tried. Not so with this. It just comes completely away from the sides, even though my litter box is old and scratched up.

This stuff is amazing. Hands down the best litter I’ve used, and I’ve used some of the pricier ones. I would not want to use another litter even if I could easily afford it.

While in the process of switching to this from the high-cost, lightweight, all-natural, no-dust litter I’d been using previously, I had one box of this stuff and the rest of the old stuff. The cats completely ignored the old stuff. They would only use this stuff. They would rather use a very used box whole I was out all day at work, than use the “better” brand which was sitting untouched in the other box.

I’ve scooped immediately after liquid waste and it barely sticks to the scoop. Certainly much less than anything else I’ve used. Still, maybe let it sit it one minute before scooping. Solid waste? You can scoop it right away, as long as it’s been covered (mine doesn’t tend to cover his so I cover it for him). If it’s been sitting there for a minute or two you wouldn’t even have to cover it before scooping. This stuff is quick at desiccating all the waste very quickly.

Be warned. This litter is heavy. Not a good choice if you or your cats are weak or have pain issues, but if you’re strong enough, or have someone else who can help you with those things, it is totally worth it.

You might even try having a strong, wheeled bin for your litter, and standing at the door scooping the litter out into the bin at the door where your Amazon driver drops it, if your arms, wrists, and hands are reasonably functional but your spine or legs give you grief. I already have distant future mobility issue workarounds planned out, because as long as they make this stuff, as long as I have cats, and as long as I am able to, I intend to keep using this.",positive
2,Pet Supplies,Dr. Elsey's Cat Litter,$10.99 - $65.93,5,"Living in the country and being a total sucker, I have more than a few cats. They find me. Even living 40 miles out in the country, further than anyone will drive to dump animals, they still find me. Seriously. I wake up in bed with cats I don't know. I come home to find cats I don't know partying in the living room, napping on my bed and helping themselves to chow in the kitchen. Last year a feral had kittens under my kitchen sink. Three cats I had just met, in my house, had litters of kittens in bed next to me while I was sleeping.

So I'm not kidding when I tell you I need good litter.

None of my cats have had any of the cement clumps some people talked about. I guess that could eventually happen if the boxes aren't cleaned out in a timely manner. I'm not willing to check that out though.

I put this litter in what I call ""The Popular Box"", the one they all seem to prefer. I used my regular litter in the back room with the other boxes that get a lot less use. Just for giggles, I skipped a day of cleaning the box with THIS litter, but did clean the ones with the other litter.

Even though the box with Dr Elsey's litter missed a day of cleaning, even though that box get about 3 times as much use as the other boxes, it didn't smell. At all. The others did.

What dust? Very minimal. I especially noticed the difference when I added old litter in the back boxes. There is almost no dust with this stuff.

And the clumping? WOW! You could hurt someone with those clumps! Seriously! If you find a stranger in your house, just grab one of these to throw. They'll be in some serious pain!

I barely noticed any odor when I was cleaning out the ""Popular Box"". The far less used boxes with the old litter seemed overwhelming after using Dr Elsey's.

One thing to note is that although this is a forty pound bag of litter, the bag it comes in is not much bigger that the 20 lb bags I usually buy. This stuff is HEAVY! I had to drag the litter over to the box and scoop it out with a cup!

I also noticed that there is a lot less tracking of litter. I wasn't expecting that.

Needless to say, I'm beyond pleased with this litter. It's a little more expensive, more so for me because I have so many ""Guest Boxes"", but I'm definitely not going back to that other stuff.

Now, if they could make a litter that will scatter itself over the poo when my cats can't be bothered. Is it so much to ask at least that much after everything I do for them???

I guess they want to make sure I don't forget who's really the boss around here.",positive
3,Pet Supplies,Dr. Elsey's Cat Litter,$10.99 - $65.93,5,"Ok I used to be a A&H snob because I thought baking soda was the almighty of odor eliminators but I'm sold on this litter. I like this litter a lot and don't mind it is unscented. I usually opt for a scent of some kind however the scented bag would have taken another week so I took a leap and tried the unscented ultra. Clumps don't fall apart while scooping, however it does stick to the bottom if your cats likes to dig but most litter does that even A&H slide if your cats dig enough. It does a good job of absorbing liquids and odor control has been great so far. It does start to get a slight smell after 3-4 days but this is an improvement by far from other brands. I scoop often 1-2 times a day for 3 cats with 3 litter boxes and if I get lazy and skip a day this litter doesn't punish me with nasty smells or small peices of clumps all over the box.. I do use a odor eliminator after I scoop by about the 3rd day or so when the slight smell starts to happen and it works well to extend the freshness. Overall I think their are better litter brands out there but not at this price point especially if you have multiple cats.",positive
4,Pet Supplies,Dr. Elsey's Cat Litter,$10.99 - $65.93,5,"I am a new pet owner and I have been exploring different litters. My roommate (at the time) was using a litter that had so much dust, the cats would come out smelling like litter and anytime I went to empty it out, the pee clumps would just fall apart. On top of that it had a scent that not only was a bad scent, but then it would be mixed with cate feces. Gross.

I grew up with cats so I have experience and have tried a few since adopting my cat. I recently moved out on my own and tried the pellets and HATED them which shocked me. I came across this litter on Amazon and honestly thought I would try it but ultimately have to continue my search. I am converted! It's got a heavier consistency so there is literally no dust. The pee balls are covered and stick together literally 9x out of ten. Poop is easy enough with any litter. I smell literally nothing, not even when I'm changing her box.

I think I will stick with this litter. I think the bad reviews, something else is going on. This is a very good product and very well executed. I have been telling all my cat mom friends to try it because I love it that much.",positive
5,Pet Supplies,Dr. Elsey's Cat Litter,$10.99 - $65.93,5,"I am very impressed with this litter so far. When I first received it and added it to my cats' litter box, I was pleasantly surprised not to be able to smell anything at all from the box. Normally, there's always a little bit of odor when I walk past the laundry room, no matter how often I scoop. This litter completely smothers any odor when the litterbox has been scooped, and I can still barely smell anything when walking past the laundry room even if the box needs to be scooped. It's important to note, however, that I have a hooded litterbox with a flap over the entrance, and I scoop the box usually every other day. I have two cats, and they fill a litterbox quickly. However, keeping 4 or so inches in the box allows them to bury things better and means I can scoop the box less and smell odors less. I haven't kept 3-4 inches in the box in the past because it takes so much litter that I would have to buy two pails just to fill it to 3-4 and then have clean to add to it as I scoop it. However, this litter's granules are larger than most others', and the 40 lb. bag is excellent for the price. After adding 3-4 inches of litter to my cats' XL size hooded box, there's still at least 2/3 of a bag left. After scooping, the litter left in the box looks clean and doesn't get discolored and wet like other litters I've used. So far, I haven't added any extra litter to the box. With other litters I've used, I usually feel the need to add some on top often after scooping because the litter in the box gets stinky really fast. With this litter, I can see myself only adding more when the level in the box gets lower, and that's what I want. I originally searched for another type of litter because one of my cats has a coughing problem, and I wanted to see if switching to an unscented, dust free litter would help. I wish it was completely dust free, but 0.1% dust isn't much to complain about. I haven't noticed any dust at all, and my cat rarely coughs any more. One thing of note about this litter is that it is EXTREMELY heavy. I say this as a man who regularly lifts upwards of 100 lbs. at work. This stuff feels like it's made of lead. I think the fact that it comes in a bag, without many places to gain purchase, makes it harder to lift. I recommend lifting it up and hugging it with both hands on the bag when pouring instead of trying to hold one corner of the bag, as this makes the litter pour out very slowly. That being said, it's also best to support the ""spout"" (or the corner you cut open) with one hand. Otherwise, the top part of the bag is going to go limp and dump a ton of litter into the box. The weight of the bag does make it cumbersome, but I'm willing to deal with the logistics of it for the quality of the litter. However, I do recommend getting a metal litter scoop. The plastic one I have bends unless I'm careful about how fast and at what angle I scoop. It makes getting into the corners difficult, and I expect the plastic scoop to break soon. I'll definitely be getting a metal scoop when that happens. Despite the heaviness of the litter, it's very easy to scoop. My cats love to dig in the corner of the box and pee, which makes the pee get stuck on the side of the box. This litter is very easy to scrape off the sides, however. It also clumps very tightly, and even weaker clumps, like those formed by the urine scraped off the side of the box, have the consistency of a thick, sandy paste and are very scoopable. I haven't had any clumps fall apart on me. Also, an unforseen benefit of the heaviness and coarseness of this litter is that my litter mat can catch tracked litter a lot better. Since switching to this litter, there have been a lot less stray granules all over the laundry room floor, and I haven't seen any litter clumped in the fur on the bottoms of my long-haired cat's paws, which is what happened with the last litter I was using. Overall, I'm very pleased with this litter, especially considering it's about $17 for a 40 lb. bag. I could easily see one bag of this litter lasting me two months, even with two cats. That being said, I'm concerned about the price fluctuations and discrepancies in quality noted by other reviewers. If the price does go up beyond how much I'm willing to pay, I will probably search for another site to order this litter from or just look for another brand. The value of this litter is a huge factor of how much I like it, so taking that away would definitely turn me away from buying this litter regularly and exclusively, which is what I plan to do if everything remains the same as with this first order. If I receive a bag of product with bad quality, I won't be ordering this litter from Amazon again and will try to find somewhere else to order it from instead. But that being said, I'm very pleased with the product that I have received for this first order, and I will definitely be purchasing this product again.",positive
6,Pet Supplies,Dr. Elsey's Cat Litter,$10.99 - $65.93,5,"I love this specific dr. Elsey litter. The clumps don't fall apart. They stay solid which helps keep the litter less crumbly and in return makes the litter last longer unlike other brands. Another positive aspect of the solid clumps is that though the clumps stay solid, it is also not wasteful. Other clumping litter brands use a lot of litter to form a clump which causes the litter to finish much faster. Not this one. The litter lasts much longer than other brands.

8,Pet Supplies,Dr. Elsey's Cat Litter,$10.99 - $65.93,4,"People write some curious things about this product.

Cat owners GM can get nose blind to it but when I’m gone for a couple of days snd come back it’s noticeable. This product performs well but not perfectly as nothing will.it clumps well but the cat digging around can mess up a few clumps and even though I fill the box deep her digging sometimes can lead to adherence to the bottom of the box.

It clumps very well and there is virtually no dust (this is a big plus for me!). I did appreciate that it was on the cheaper side too. The only thing I think they need to work on is covering up the odor a bit better. I am a twice a day scooper and I still had odor problems. After awhile I did add a freshener to the box then and it took care of the problem. Other than the slight smell issue, this is a great litter and I would definitely recommend.",positive

Everything was good until I noticed the bags were breaking down a lot sooner than garbage pick up day, which was the reason to double bag. That is my only complaint about this product.
The pros about these bags were that they are large enough to fit my dogs dinosaur sized dung in one scoop and still had enough extra to knot.
Another pro was the quantity that was offered in a box, and that I only had a finger break through once. That was because of my nails.

When he passed away, I continued using it when I got two kittens. I’ve tried many, MANY other litters, but I keep coming back to this one because it works so well. It clumps extremely well, making scooping much easier. I’ve learned over the years that as much as I hate litter box maintenance, the best thing to do is to scoop often and use this litter as it makes the scooping take up just a few seconds of my time. With other litters, clumping doesn’t happen every time, so then it takes me a long time to properly get every bit of unclumped nastiness out, sometimes to the point where the whole box would be mixing with unclumped nastiness, and I would need to replace all the litter.

Because of my stubbornness I’ve tried every brand & formula I could get my hands on. Tiddy Cats, Arm & Hammer, Store brands, expensive brands from chewy, the bulk bag, clumping & non clumping.
You name it, I tried it.
Fast forward to last December when my husband & I had to go out of town for a medical appointment & my mom came to stay with my kids while we were gone.

By the end of second day she had gone to Walmart & bought a box of this, had my daughter throughly clean out the box with bleach & fill it with this litter.
When we came home a few days later the house didn’t smell of cat pee/poop like it did before with the tiddy cats litter we were using.
Needless to say we switched to this litter and haven’t looked back.
Yes it’s a little more pricey and you get a little less than you would from another brand at the same price point, but holy freaking cow, not having a house smell of cat piss is worth a few extra bucks imo.

Also the scent is not just a pleasant aroma, but it is P&G's Febreze molecules that do encapsulate odors, not just cover them up. So if you're away over a weekend, or less-than-punctual on changing your cat box (no judgment!) then this will be far better than cheap store brand litter or some of the other brands of clumping clay litter.

It's not magic though! Clean our boxes regularly, fellow cat-staff members. And I really doubt the ""controls odor up to 10 days"" claim.

I don't particularly recommend buying it here, though I just did again this week. At least not in the 14 or 28 pound individual box variants. Amazon packs them in an outer box with nothing but a basically-for-show strip of airpack (large bubble plastic) that does nothing against a heavy box of non-hermetically-sealed cat litter. Thus, some, or at times a lot of cat litter comes out, sloshing around the bottom of the box or coming out of it entirely through the corners and loosely-taped shipping box. That's what happened to me on my latest shipment. I can't blame the Amazon delivery people nor really the hardworking Amazon fulfillment center workers either - those packaging materials are what they are given to work with, and work reasonably well when there are lighter items or less room to shift around during the many stages of transport.

If you are going to buy it from Amazon, I suggest getting the 38 (or 42) pound package of 4 plastic bags of 9.5 or 10.5 pounds. That's both fully sealed and more convenient, because you can take out and use only one bag at a time, or bring just one each over to each catbox for multi-cat households. I used to get that on Amazon Subscibe-and-Save but it regularly would go out of stock.

Loose stool, blood in stool, so off he went to the vet.

He got a couple of meds I had to give him with a syringe (NO parasites, vet gave meds basically to CALM any inflammation, soothe tummy).

Days after finishing meds, basically more of the same, but no blood. Just loose stools.

The lady that is head of the rescue I got him from suggested this product.

It's been about a week and now almost totally normal stools! It was better after about four or five days, now no more piles of poo!

I thought it would be difficult getting him to eat it as I just sprinkle on wet canned food. NOPE, HE LIKES IT! A LOT!

I started out just giving him half a packet because he's just about six pounds, to see how he would do on it. After about 3-4 days, I started giving him a whole packet, half on wet food he got in the morning, half on wet food in evening.

Only con is I wish wasn't so expensive! BUT it's working where the prescription meds didn't.

SO IF YOU HAVE a SMALL kitten or cat, you may want to START with half. I use a clippie to just fold over the top and give him the rest the next day.

50,Pet Supplies,ARM & HAMMER Clump & Seal Platinum Cat Litter,$39.99 - $62.99,5,"I have 3 cats & I have always struggled with little box odor. It doesn't matter how many times I scoop the boxes it always has the pungent urine odor. I have tried pretty much every ""basic"" litter and they are all worthless. I moved in to a rental that was... Um... Not animal friendly 🥴 to put it nicely. I stressed myself sick over their boxes and went overboard with lining the wall and floor with black plastic. I scooped those boxes like every hour on the hour. It was that or risk losing the house and I tell ya even scooping that frantically it still smelled. I was using Tidy Cat Multi Cat Household and it didn't mask anything. I went to Chewy (sorry Amazon) and they had a buy 2 get 1 free special so I took the plunge on Arm & Hammer Clump and Slide and Seal litters. I tell you what I was absolutely blown away. Now I need to add that regular arm & hammer litter in the yellow box is like all the other ""basic"" litters, doesn't work. I don't know what they did or added to this line but it is off the charts AMAZING! The slide version is awesome, it's slightly more expensive but the litter absolutely does not stick on the sides or bottom of the box. It's not one of those ""doesn't stick bad"" but it straight up will NOT stick to the box! The Seal version is like regular litters and does cake on the sides but nowhere near as bad as the other litters on the market. The BIGGEST AND BEST thing is the odor control. The entire time I used this litter I had ZERO litterbox scent whatsoever. I scooped them once a day and actually got lazy a few times and scooped every other day. My son and husband came downstairs shortly after I switched and both of them commented on how there was no smell whatsoever. I cannot rate this high enough. The clumping on both kinds is also next level! It scoops solid, it doesn't crumble and leave the little bits of wet litter like the others either. For that reason your litter will last longer. Even though the price is higher when you take in to consideration the zero odor and amazing scoop-ability you are actually spending less on litter than you would be with the other brands. I can go through a whole 38 pound box and not need to do a complete box change. Please, try this! I swear on it! It makes my stomach turn to drop $50 plus on litter at a time but in the long run like I said it's actually cheaper. I have a Sphynx and he is incredibly picky with litter, he's totally naked and doesn't have a single hair anywhere. His feet tend to trap litter and tidy cat is the worst for him. It's coarse & chunky. The Slide & Seal litter is very fine, almost like it's been ground so it's doesn't stick to his pads or get stuck in between his adorable toes. Lol. If you can't already tell I am all about this litter! It sincerely has saved me. I couldn't stomach the thought of having to re-home my babies when we had to move, I could not find a pet friendly house to save my life! It was imperative that I completely eliminate the litterbox smell. I took a leap, bought 3 boxes, and said a zillion prayers! YAY YAY YAY!

That's the main problem with the other brands, these granules become exhausted and detach from the waste. There is no ""exhausted"" state here where you have to dump the box and start over because it just isn't working anymore. Scoop, add more as needed, rinse, repeat. It's a beautiful thing!

60,Pet Supplies,"Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, motion detection, Works with Alexa",$34.99 - $49.99,4,"UPDATED: When I saw these smaller cameras announced I was excited and looked forward to adding them to my existing 5 camera Blink system. I figured these would be a great replacement for the XT/XT2 cameras that I had inside my house so I could then re-purpose those for additional outdoor locations. I thought this was a brilliant addition to the Blink camera ecosystem, adding a lower cost camera for indoor applications like mine where the benefits of the battery power and weather-proofness would be overkill. Soon as they were released I ordered up a two-pack to add to my system. I installed one of the them and found that the picture quality right out of the box wasn’t the best but once you change the video quality setting to “Enhanced” it’s right up there with the XT2 quality. The motion detection is a little spotty, as they use a new digital method of detecting motion (AI compares one frame to the next to check for changes). Some very subtle movement will show up, like a shadow moving across the viewing area, but then actually walking across it won’t (sometimes). A rep I spoke with said that they are working on an update to improve the consistency of that feature, which will be available as an over-the-air update since it is a digital-based feature, which I think is pretty cool. So originally my poor review was based around the cloud storage feature on these cameras. After I purchased these cameras I looked into the cloud storage feature as all of the literature I found on them stated that a subscription would be required. Since this is different than the previous XT & XT2 systems I was not pleased about this. After I posted my original review a rep from Blink reached out to clarify the cloud storage situation. So here is what I learned: If you already have an XT or XT2 system, then you can add these cameras to it without having to get a paid subscription. If you do not have a Blink system at all, and these cameras are the first ones you get, then you get a free subscription until December 31st, 2020; then you will pay $3/month per camera after that. By then though, they plan to have released a new sync module with an SD card slot so that you can locally store video clips without having to pay for a subscription at all. Personally I don’t think they intend to have too many people on the subscription plan, I think they see the SD card functionality being more of a selling point but they had to piggy-back the first adopters of these Mini cameras onto the cloud storage until the new sync module gets released. Maybe they had delays in getting the new sync module released at the same time as the Mini due to factory closings around the world right now. I am much happier after this getting cleared up, but hope that they update the cloud storage & subscription info on the product pages to make it much clearer how this all works. Had I looked at all of the available info before buying these, then I probably would not have purchased them based on the unclear info that’s out there. In the end, the savior of the situation was the rep that contacted me from Blink. He clarified all of my concerns, gave me a great amount of info on the product, and answered all of my questions (I had lot of them). To be clear, the rep did not once ask me to change my review, take it down, or in any way artificially influence me to do any of those things. The great job he did led to me to change this of my own accord, as they really took care of my concerns. One star deducted for the confusion but three added back in for the great CS experience. Good product can get you a buyer, but good service gets you a customer for life. Blink has done a fantastic job turning a disappointed (and misinformed) buyer into a satisfied customer. So to recap, if you have an existing Blink system, buy these and use ‘em where you don’t need the wireless ones. If you are looking to get these as your first Blink setup, get them knowing you will have the option of paying for a subscription starting in 2021 or a one-time purchase of a sync module with SD card slot to store your video clips.",positive
61,Pet Supplies,"Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, motion detection, Works with Alexa",$34.99 - $49.99,2,"I bought this to use as a baby monitor, thinking if the quality was good I would end up purchasing an outdoor set as well. I got it in this afternoon, and set up was super easy. The picture quality is excellent for the price point.

The main issue for me is that there is no option for continuous viewing. The live view from the app will automatically shut off after 30 seconds if you don't tap the ""continue?"" prompt. If I had known this ahead of time, I would have never purchased a Blink camera. I watch my daughter on a Fire tablet while I work at night, and it's really not feasible to stop typing every 30 seconds to press a button.

Maybe it's my fault for not realizing it, but I don't remember reading any information about the length of viewing time, so I assumed it would be like the Foscam I had sought to replace. If Blink ever adds an update for continuous viewing, I would repurchase in a heartbeat, but for now, I'm sending it back.",negative
62,Pet Supplies,"Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, motion detection, Works with Alexa",$34.99 - $49.99,3,"I pre-ordered 4 cameras without any reviews having been posted, so I hope that this helps someone. First off, the cameras are pretty nice, very easy to setup and get connected and the price is just about perfect. The app is where things start to fall apart. It clearly was created for the other Blink cameras that are battery dependent, so most of the quirks/problems I found are probably necessary for battery savings on the other Blink cameras. I have had cameras for well over ten years and have gone through several different apps/programs to access and store the video but I have never had an app that did NOT allow me to view all of my cameras at the same time. This one requires you to select a single camera and activate it individually to view real time video. I assume that this was designed for battery savings, but since these cameras are always on, it now serves no purpose. Additionally, not having the ability to view all of my cameras, while activated in a single 4 pane window seems a step in the wrong direction. For years I have been able to see live feeds in a multi-pane format and select the camera I want to zoom in on that one, not with this app.

Second, tech support is, at best, not good. I contacted them regarding the IR light that apparently can NOT be turned off (although you can turn it off via the app for the other Blink cameras?!) and the support tech actually stated that he did not know anything about these cameras and had to ask someone else. That was a first for me. The IR light is probably not a big deal for most, but I have for years had an indoor camera pointed out a window since my front yard is pretty well lit at night and the IR light stuck in the ON position make that impossible.

I never review anything, but I wanted to get the word out on this. I suspect that these cameras were kind of rushed and the app just re-purposed, so it my sincere hope that they will address the live view concerns in future app updates specific to Blink Mini owners. Soon I hope!!!! Here's to hoping!

Update: I was contacted by Blink following regarding my review. They indicated that multiple people had voiced similar concerns about the apps real-time capabilities and they made it sound like they were developing an update to the app to address this. They also offered to send me an additional camera (an older model) that does allow you to turn off the IR at no charge. I asked directly if this would be in exchange for changing my review and they specifically did NOT ask me to amend this review. If nothing else, that is GREAT customer service.",fair
63,Pet Supplies,"Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, motion detection, Works with Alexa",$34.99 - $49.99,5,"We purchased our first Blink Home Security Camera July of 2018. We were going out of the country and wanted to make sure our 18 year old son closed the garage door and locked the house. It did the job and we felt better knowing while on the other side of the world we could monitor our home.
The following Summer we were so happy with our indoor system, we decided to purchase 2 outdoor cameras with the 2 way audio, and were so happy with the video and audio quality, we bought another add on outdoor camera, the next month.
A year later we found the mini indoor cameras. We have one for a child's bedroom and one for the playroom. The video and audio quality is great.
A year after that we bought another 3 outdoor Cameras, again video and audio quality is great.
Just before Christmas 2021 Blink came out with the doorbell camera, and we purchased it. One, because it was blink and 1/2 the price of a ring doorbell camera. Two, because the doorbell that came with our new build home was so quiet, we couldn't ever hear the bell ring.
In total we now have...
3 Indoor battery powered
2 Indoor mini corded power
6 Outdoor battery powered
1 doorbell wired to exciting doorbell.

Blink offers two subscription plans.

1 Blink device
$3 per month or $30 annually

Unlimited Blink devices
$10 per month or $100 annually

You do not have to have a Blink Subscription if you do not choose to, but you won't be able to store videos.

With the subscription you are even able to share your videos by text, or email. To neighbors, Friends, Family, and even the police department.

Cons/irritations
When an outdoor camera faces the sun at any point of the day, the motion detection will go off, until you adjust the motion activity spots in the camera settings. This can take a few days to work out the kinks.
Indoor mini cameras the motion activity spots don't always work. Sometimes it will go off when there is motion in the grayed out zones, and sometimes not go off in the non-greyed out zones. This maybe human error on our part. We are looking for a longer cord for the mini's to mount on the wall or ceiling. The are options to rotate the camera view, so that you are able to mount the camera wherever you need.

Overall we are happy with our Blink system and hope the company continues to grow and come out with new products.

Compared to my parents very very expensive Arlo system, Blink is more reliable, and is more cost-effective. So much so, my parents have ditched the Arlo camera system and have purchased a new Blink system.

We highly recommend Blink to anyone who would like to have a home video camera system that works, and won't break the bank.
We love that you can start out small and work your way in to as much as you want/need.",positive
64,Pet Supplies,"Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, motion detection, Works with Alexa",$34.99 - $49.99,4,"I have several of both the Minis and the outdoor models, and this Mini is almost identical to the outdoor and indoor models in terms of quality and features. The only real difference between them is the Mini isn't weather-proof, cannot handle the extreme temperatures of the outdoor models (-4 to 113 F), has a better mount, can be image-flipped, and runs solely on a power adapter instead of batteries.

* Not Weather-proof: DO NOT use this mini camera outdoors or in an uninsulated building. It is not water-proof and will likely be damaged by humidity and high or low temperatures.

* Mount & Image Flipping: this mount is great and allows easier installation locations than the indoor and outdoor cameras, because it's mounted from the bottom/top instead of the back. Since this Mini can be mounted from the bottom or top, this means it can be turned at many more angles on all 3 axes than the Indoor/Outdoor. If you have to mount it upside-down, such as from a ceiling, the app simply allows you to flip the image vertically. The problem with the indoor/outdoor models is the mounting is on the back, which means you can't ""hang"" it from a ceiling and point it in any direction. Instead, if you want to mount the Indoor/Outdoor on a ceiling or near the ceiling, you have a very small angle to point it. This makes the Indoor/Outdoor cameras inconvenient to install from above in most situations because you'll end up having to point the camera directly outward from your mounting surface. If from a ceiling, it'll face down. If from the top of a wall, it'll face outward along the ceiling. The Mini's mount is much better.

CONS:

* The ""Talk"" feature is totally useless. Regardless of bandwidth or proximity to the router or a sync module (purchased separately), the Talk feature produces broken sound that is impossible to understand. Plus there's a long delay of 3-6 seconds, making this feature useless for conversations, even if the other person understood anything you were saying. Over several tests with all of our different Blink cameras, none of them produce clear enough speech that someone can understand you, no matter where the cameras are located.

* No wired Ethernet option. This camera can only be used with a wireless router and Internet connection. There are no other options.

* Cannot be used as a USB web cam

* Cannot be used for continuous live feeds. The live feed only allows up to 30 seconds of viewing, and you must hit a Continue button every 30 seconds to keep it going. So if need a camera to leave running for frequent live video, Blink isn't what you're looking for.

* Cloud Storage Subscription semi-requirement: the Blink Home Monitor App's features become limited if you don't purchase a cloud storage subscription. If you stick with the Sync Module for local storage and do not purchase any of the cloud storage plans, VIDEO CLIPS CANNOT BE VIEWED THROUGH THE APP. The app will only allow you to view the live feed, adjust camera settings, and use the Talk feature. Without a cloud storage subscription, the only way to view your camera's video clips is by physically taking your USB storage device (purchased separately) out of the Sync Module (purchased separately) and placed in a USB port on a computer (purchased separately).

To be very clear here, if you do not purchase a cloud storage subscription, you will not be able to view any of the stored video clips (including motion-activated clips) from your phone. Period. This point has not been made clearly anywhere in the advertisements, support screens, Amazon product pages, or Blink Web site, but it's a crucial piece of information that the company is being very ambiguous about.

To repeat, IF YOU DON'T PURCHASE A CLOUD STORAGE SUBSCRIPTION, YOU CANNOT VIEW YOUR VIDEO CLIPS THROUGH YOUR PHONE. I have seen some reviewers assert that this isn't technically possible, but as a software engineer I know this isn't true. The Blink developers clearly focused on developing the cloud storage and subscriptions, using the mobile app as the user's ""portal"" app to access and view the cloud-stored video clips, and have simply decided not to develop a mechanism for the mobile app to access the video clips stored in your Sync Module. I want to be very clear here....this IS POSSIBLE and would require a lot of development to accomplish, but Blink just doesn't provide this functionality (yet). Whether they are working on this feature and plan to add it in the future is unknown. But the lack of direct integration between the mobile app and the Sync Module's local storage (over the local network, especially) is a significant shortcoming in the entire Blink system. This also means that if your camera loses its internet connection, it will not capture video, you can't view the live feed, the Talk feature won't work, and you can't change the camera's settings.. The Blink system simply does not allow the mobile app to connect directly to a camera or Sync Module on your local network. It is designed to use the Internet only. This is a very important point that customers must understand. Both the camera and the Sync Module require an active Internet connection to function. They will not work independently or with just a wifi router. Internet is required.",positive
65,Pet Supplies,"Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, motion detection, Works with Alexa",$34.99 - $49.99,4,"I already have three blink outdoor cameras which I purchased over 2 years ago. I've had no problems with them and I've never had to sign up for a subscription.
I wanted to add this camera as an indoor camera to keep an eye on my pets during the day. As soon as I hooked it up and synced it with my app and module a pop-up came up about a free trial. I decided that I did not want the free trial and the pop-up ad never went away on my usual viewing of my cameras on my app. After the supposed trial was up I lost all motion detecting and live viewing from my new mini blink indoor camera. I was under the impression when I purchased it that I could still get motion detect and live view when I requested, just not live recording. Nothing that I did seemed to matter. I absolutely couldn't even use the camera anymore for anything not even motion detect. It's amazing to me how that as soon that trial (that I did not want to take a part of ended) so did the use of my camera. So I unplugged it and I sent it back. Now the advertisement about the free trial will not come off of my screen when I open my app. I'm not sure if this is their way of forcing me to use the paid subscription. It's a shame because I really did like my indoor blink camera but I'm not going to be forced into a subscription. I only needed it for motion detecting which it did just fine until that trial ended. In my book that's a scam. I suggest you try to do better Blink. I guess I'll be purchasing some rogue indoor camera. I would have loved to have stuck with Blink.",positive
66,Pet Supplies,"Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, motion detection, Works with Alexa",$34.99 - $49.99,5,"I’ve been reading a lot of reviews on google and other places on these mini cameras and a lot of people said they were crap and others said they were amazing. All I’m going to say is that it’s a great deal! Probably spend $50 tops for a camera that can pretty much sit anywhere as long as you can plug it in and it comes with a free month subscription to test! It’s absolutely amazing. I armed mine at night and went to take a picture in the Amazon app and as you can see I got notified immediately! The picture wasn’t even uploaded yet 🤣. It’s an amazing deal. You can pay $10 a month for the subscription after you use the free trial ($120yr) or you can pay $100 for a year up front which is to add multiple cameras. If you only need one it’s cheaper like I think $3 or $6 or something like that. Very easy on the wallet lol. I think it’s probably going to be the very cheapest security system that has that many perks. I can record live or it records for me if someone steps in my yard! It’s got great camera quality for the price. I thought it was going to be like crappy slightly pixelated but no it’s really decent actually. I’m really happy with my purchase and I plan on getting more cameras and adding them to the $100 a year plan.

P.S. Instal and setup connection only took about 10 minutes after I figured out where I wanted it!! Also very small, discreet, and hidden! Totally recommend!!",positive
67,Pet Supplies,"Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, motion detection, Works with Alexa",$34.99 - $49.99,4,"I bought three of these for security for my house. They worked well for the price with a few drawbacks.

I knew it would require a subscription after 30 days. I still bought them and I can’t say I’m happy I did but I’m also not sad about it. I decided not to subscribe and they still work, but with no features.

The night vision doesn’t work great if you are pointing these out a window to view outdoors. It shines on the glass making a very bright reflection so you that you cannot see outside. This would happen with any camera though so I’m not sure it’s really a big negative. If you use it as intended (not pointed at a reflective surface) it works great! You can adjust the brightness in camera settings.

The way you run the cord through the base and then clip it together is the worst design. I hope whoever designed it has to install 1000 of these every day for the rest of their life… it comes apart constantly even without touching it… be prepared to swear if you need to try and perch this somewhere difficult to reach.

I’m annoyed with paying subscription fees to use basic features. *This is the biggest drawback in my opinion, but I obviously knew about it when I purchased the product so…🤷🏻‍♀️

Positives
I stuck it outside my window all winter through negative temps (I’m in the Rocky Mountains and it gets COLD) and it still worked perfectly!

Basically you plug it in, point it _(fight with the base for 10 minutes) and connect with the app. It’s very simple to use.

Without a subscription, you can still use it to check the live view and you can screen record if you wanted too (no sound though with the screen record).

To be honest I never check the cameras anymore, and without alerts about motion detection, it’s not really good for security.
That being said, I moved one of mine to my bird cage so I can check in on my lil guy during the day while I’m away.💖🦜it works great for this odd purpose so that’s an unexpected bonus!

I probably wouldn’t buy again because I want to be able to save my clips without a subscription fee, and I’d rather have like a “personal system” that isn’t collecting my data and that I could control access too. But I’ll take what I can get because I don’t have much money and these were very cheap when I bought them.",positive
68,Pet Supplies,"Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, motion detection, Works with Alexa",$34.99 - $49.99,4,"Ok, I've given these things a shot, and I finally decided to write a review. I have two of these outside of my house with a ring doorbell. The motion detection is a joke... I have it set up to trigger within certain zones, because literally the wind blowing the trees will set it off... but apparently cars driving down my driveway to my house, coming IN MY HOUSE, and delivery drivers pulling up to the house do not set off the motion detection. Make sure to turn them off at night because bugs will fly in front of them and wig out the cameras setting off the motion detection. I have had them go off a dozen times at 3 am. Will definitely be shopping for something else.

UPDATE:
Matthew from Blink reached out to me about my concerns. I showed him a screenshot of what my cameras were seeing and the type of cameras I was using. He explained that the cameras I bought, were more designed for inside use. This was more than likely causing them to just not function the way I was expecting.

For my sake and my cat's, I went on the hunt for something that wouldn't make me cough every time I did the deed.

One cat pees an unimaginable amount, which can leave a puddle if the level of litter is low, or if it's in a corner where it cannot spread out. I have 6 cats that use mainly 4 boxes. There's no sifting; the litter drops easily through the scoop. If you start with a clean box, the litter doesn't stick at all. If you're human, the litter can get like clay. It still hardly sticks, especially if you can let what's sticking dry out again.
Yes, it can track outside of the boxes, and is not lightweight, but it's 99.99% dustless and I rarely smell anything of the dirty litter, and nothing of the clean.
All litters depend on preference, but after trying dozens over the decades, this one truly changed my life. I can keep the cat areas cleaner with less effort.

100,Pet Supplies,Purina Friskies Canned Wet Cat Food 40 ct. Variety Packs,$28.48 - $65.00,5,"I’m not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn’t eat it. We have had as many as 9 here in our rural home, several were strays that stop by for a meal and one stays inside in poor or cold weather, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they’re hungry. They get canned food in the morning meal and various types of grain free dry food (based on price) the rest of the day. We had one cat that was about 17 years old who passed away not too long ago and all she could eat was canned food. I can’t say how good it is but the price is still acceptable with Subscribe & Save it’s a deal for us and not available locally which is 45 miles away… as is the Vet. The problem is the strays want the better stuff rather than the Purina Seafood Sensations we try to keep them on. Hiding the food dishes or pushing some cats outside while others eat is hard so now we mix this with it and they seem to be happy… the other cats seem to be liking it also though we prefer to keep them on the Taste of the Wild. We have a few acres that are total fenced so the cats seem to feel pretty safe from all the dogs that run loose. I guess they’re not really strays because they rarely stray more than a 100-yards from the house and can hear a cat food can pop from the other side of the field.

We had a cat develop some urinary problems a few years ago: bladder stones which restricted her ability to urinate and caused some bleeding and she was trying to urinate all day long to help relieve the irritation. The Vet claimed it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food that causes the stones because the cat can’t process enough liquid to handle the food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet dry special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit and chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn’t have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meat varieties in pâté or gravy form. That’s what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is more, but urinates fewer times, now because they don’t have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they’re eating. We feed them Friskies or 9-Lives in the cans and started with Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae, Natural Balance Pea or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it’s more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can’t say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food. In general, the cats prefer a dry food that’s fish flavored.

What we’re doing is based on the information provided by Lisa A. Pierson, DVM on Making Cat Food (catinfo.org) and she is of the opinion that cats need the bones which makes the grinding process more difficult so the canned foods do have the bones. We tried grinding our own mix of chicken & rabbit but that wore thin fast and I can’t raise either with the intention of killing them to feed cats. We still feed them some kibble because feeding all these cats gets pretty expensive. It’s a shame packaging is getting smaller and prices do nothing but remain the same or go up. We purchased the Merrick and Wild Buffalo grain free dry foods and the bags are now down to 11 lbs. each. However, when doing the math the canned food is still less expensive per serving.

As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we’ll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that’s worth 5 stars… in my opinion. We had Subscribe & Save on some other brands but they disappear soon since it’s heavy to ship and it’s recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly. I’m posting this review slightly modified for every cat food we purchase rather than writing a new one for a particular brand. As an example, if it continues… and the price continues to rise we’ll stop buying them and even with 15% off (now reduced to 5% off on most items and it’s a rare to see 15% anymore) and free shipping they cost more than at the food store… end of price increase rant! I find micromanaging my subscriptions to be a real pain but if I don’t I’ll either pay too much or miss out on a deal with it in some other size bag. Our cats have several acres of fenced property so who knows what they eat out there but once inside we’re determined not to give them anything that might cause them discomfort or us a Vet bill and listening to one of them whine for what would be a 90-mile round trip to that Vet. We’ve been using this for about 3-years and it’s one of the few that are still available to us with a discount. The cat with the issue that started all this is still going strong and she seems to have more than one life since I found her lying in a roadway on a cold rainy day about 15-years ago.

The upside to purchasing the wet food here is the delivery and it comes in a wrapped case lot. Going to the local stores (which are 40-miles away) means buying it by the can or, if lucky, getting an open flat of it. Either way, it’s a bunch of loose cans that and a lot of bags to haul home, sort them out and then put them away. Now I can get over 100-cans at once and it only takes a few minutes to open a box at my door and put them away so that convenience is a real plus. Since the cans are not all that sturdy a few bent ones are to be expected and I’ve even had a few split open that had to be discarded but that’s not a problem with the product so I don’t knock off stars for it. The last order of this one had come open, was repacked and then taped up but the number of cans of each selection was off but the total was correct. I received fewer of the Salmon and more of the others but I get the Salmon in other packaging so that’s OK.",positive

Cat owners know they can be picky and demanding, but even more so these days between supply chain issues and rising costs it can sometimes be tricky to balance their wants to our challenges. Having this product available to keep stocked is a great option. I have to trust my cat’s on the issues of taste. They eat it and stop staring at me. That being said, the condition of the cans in these multipacks can often be concerning. If you are buying in bulk to stay stocked, check the condition of the actual cans right away.

I like how it is opaque. I don't get those see through bags because I don't want to see the contents! As for smell containment, it's pretty good once tied up.

I thought that by having my traditional scooping litter delivered right to my door that my litter box struggle would be considerably less. I was wrong. I could just barely manage getting down on my knees in order to scoop the box, but what I could not do was carry out the heavy bag of scooped clumps and remaining dirty litter in the box or lift the heavy bag up over the side of the dumpster to dispose of it. I also could not manage to wash and sanitize the box every 7 or 9 days as I always have. I was becoming very concerned about the health and happiness of my pets and myself. I worried about the bacteria that was multiplying at an incredible speed, the odor, and more than anything that the cats would either hold their urine or attempt to find alternative places to eliminate because I was unable to properly dispose of their obviously filthy and smelly waste or keep their litter and box as fresh as possible. Enter the fresh scoop box, and WOW has it changed my life and my cats lives! Now when it comes to the litter box, essentially it scoops itself. After 12-14 days I lift the very light housing up away from the disposable litter tray, take the litter tray box top out from under the litter tray which now contains the dirty litter and cover the used litter tray with the clean box top. I then take 4 pieces of inexpensive packing tape or two of giant rubber bands and tightly secure each side of the box. It is amazing to me that approx 14 days of used odor free litter ( produced by 2 cats) is contained in a (after taping it closed) compact, clean, approx size is 25""x15 and approx 2-3"" thick (deep),extremely light weight, and in white unmarked box. I can carry the box outside under my arm and can with absolutely no effort at all drop it right into the dumpster. I used to have layer 3 new stretch scented trash bags inside of each other to make a reinforced bag that was certain not to tear with the weight of the used litter, get on my knees next to box and try scoop the very thick, sludgy, wet, and heavy globs of used litter twice a day. The trash pick up is three times a week, because the urine odor attracts rats, I would have wait with an extremely heavy stinking garbage bag with 2-3 days worth of dirty litter until just before the garbage pick occurred to throw out the dirty litter. I would always panic when I had to rush around after hearing the dump truck coming down the street trying to get the very heavy garbage bag outside and in the dumpster before the truck arrived. Many times, even if I could use a small cart to carry the bag out, I just could not lift the bag up into the dumpster. The whole issue was just becoming a HUGE problem and worry for me. I am so relieved and happy to say, that thanks to the technology of scoop free litter box and efficiency that Amazon offers concerning shipping and delivery, I am no longer worrying or struggling just trying to take care of my pets. It is really awesome!! The only downside and I hate to point out any negatives with this lifesaver, is the price. It is really expensive for me now that I am on a fixed income due to my health. I worry about the price continuing to escalate at a rapid rate over time. As for the product 5 stars as for the price I wish that there was a better lower price offered for buying the 6 pack of refills or a refill program or club that the company-not Amazon- offered for a significant savings for consistent consumers. I will say that the best and cutest added bonus of the scoop free litter box system is that the cats LOVE ❤️ to race over to the box after they hear the ""arm"" mechanism engage, and they wait crouching down until the ""show"" starts. My smarty pants bengal has figured out how the whole thing works. She will round up her trusty, but less smart partner in crime, step halfway inside of the box and with over exaggerated scratching movements attempting to ""set off"" the cleaning mechanism. After a few seconds of wild movement, she quickly backs up and out of the box then crouches down with her buddy on the mat waiting for the show to start. Hilarious! I highly and definitely recommend this litter box. This box especially addresses concerns for anyone who struggles daily ( due to health, mobility, age, living arrangements, etc) or simply really dislikes the whole process of lugging home crazy heavy boxes of dusty litter, scooping the box religiously, disposing of the dirty litter, the odor produced from the litter box, and suffering from allergies as well as extra dusting/sweeping around the home due to the dust processed from even the newest scoopable litter.",positive

I am diagnosing myself as CP phobic (cat pee phobic). This is not yet an official disease but I am working on a patent. The roots of my CP phobia come from my childhood days as does everything else that is wrong with my life but I will skip the details for a book I will later write and discuss with Dr. Oz. Cats were around me in my childhood days and due to absent parents, they peed everywhere and little was done to clean it up. Therefore, the smell of cat pee brings severe anxiety, anger, and anything else that is related to a negative feeling. In 2002, a small kitten followed me into a 7-11. She was friendly but obviously abandoned and probably had her days limited if left in the busy parking lot of this convenience store. So on this wonderful day in the winter, I walked out with a Diet Coke, a pack of Marlboro lights, and a kitten. All three items were destined to deteriorate my health.

Fast forward to 2017 and this same cat is still with me. I am almost certain this cat will outlive me and I am only 34. This is the last cat I will ever own. Due to her age, attitude, and possibly her political views, she decided to start peeing on the carpet. I immediately google ""life span of indoor cats."" I realized I have at least 2 years left but maybe 5 years. I then take this 11 pound ball of fur to the vet to pay a lot of money for a diagnosis that my cat is healthy and a brat. Both of us come home hating each other. The peeing continues. Below is how I handled the situation in which she is still alive and I am slightly more unhinged than before. Several products will be mentioned as I am copying and pasting this review to all the companies who are responsible in allowing this cat to currently live through her natural life with me.

I spent a HUGE chunk of money on the litter robot. I recommend going to the litter robot website and researching this expensive toilet for cats. They have great customer service too. The litter robot is life changing for anyone who actually plans on owning cats for fun and for cats who refuse to use a dirty litter box. Due to my CP phobia, I plunked down the money. Everything worked great until my cat saw me enjoying life. The peeing began again. I put down a plain old square litter box and added ""Cat Attract"" litter. The peeing stopped. My adorable ball of high maintenance fur now uses the litter robot to go number two and the plain square box to go number one. The ""Cat Genie"" trash can is a must with anyone who has CP phobia. It keeps the smell down to a minimum and saves on trash bags.

Now that my 15 year old queen is satisfied with her restroom, I am now left to attack the cat pee smell. Putting Febreeze on a cat pee spot is like putting a cute SuperMan band aid on an 8 inch deep gash; it's super adorable but we all know I am going to pass out from the blood loss. Attacking cat pee is serious business and requires hours of work, determination, and money. Did I state how I will never own a cat again?

First you will need Rocco and Roxie pet stain remover. Just buy the jug if you are battling cat pee. The spray bottle will not be used. Pour Rocco and Roxie on the cat pee. It needs to be a puddle that soaks in through the carpet and into the carpet pad. We are not using a band aid, we are going in and sanitizing this dire situation. As you get the spots you can see, grab a UV light, turn off the lights, and prepare for night battle. Find all the illuminating spots and pour that Rocco and Roxie on all spots. Cat pee is no laughing matter to people like me. After all the spots are drenched, wait it out for a few hours and soak as much up with paper towels. If you use a towel, I feel you are transferring cat pee from one spot to the next. There will be a slight chemical smell. Again, cat pee is not like spilling your tumbler of vodka and soda water because the cat trips you up on purpose. Cat pee is anger and anxiety wrapped into one huge ball which needs strong chemicals to destroy.

If you are satisfied with Rocco and Roxie, and no odor of cat pee is present, then continue on with your life. If you are CP phobic and can detect a small whiff of cat pee, proceed to step 2.

Step two requires buying Angry Orange. Angry Orange is a smell that cats hate and is actually pretty pleasant to others. It smells like straight oranges. I bought the spray bottle and the concentrated refill bottle. Because I am CP phobic, I put a lot of the concentrated angry orange in a spray bottle and a little bit of water. I grabbed my UV light and went after the spots like the crazy, mad woman I have become. I sprayed all the spots only to have the entire house overwhelmed with the smell of orange. I am pretty sure my neighbors think I have opened a juicing station in the middle of my kitchen. I highly recommend following the directions of using the correct ratio of water to Angry Orange. If you do not follow the directions, not only will you think about writing a book called ""James and the Giant Orange"" but there will be slight orange spots on your carpet. Which now we can go to step 3.

Rocco and Roxie has an OxyClean product. This carpet cleaner gets out the toughest stains including my error of Angry Orange stains. Spray the product on any stain, let it sit for 5 minutes, and then start working on it with paper towels.

At this point, I am satisfied I have fought a good battle but I am still wary. I have an oreck orbiter to clean my travertine floors. I bought the attachments for cleaning the carpet and also Oreck Dry Carpet Cleaner. I spray the Rocco and Roxie OxyClean product as a mist on a 6 by 6 foot spot and then sprinkle the dry carpet cleaner all over. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. I rub the cleaner into the carpet with my oreck orbiter. Wait 45 minutes to 2 hours and vacuum. The Dry Carpet Cleaner gets out stains but it also gets out all the allergens and cat litter smell. I am not a fan of steam cleaning carpets. I have never had success. The Dry Carpet Cleaner is great for spring cleaning carpets or being completely unhinged by cat pee and needing to verify, the carpet is indeed clean.

Finally, after a week, I spray the areas in where I want my cat to never pee on, walk on, and or let alone even look at with the Natural Lemon Aerosol spray. Cats hate the smell of lemons and oranges.

I am now 90 percent satisfied I have won the battle of cat pee. I will not be 100 percent satisfied until I replace all the carpet but that will not happen until my cat crosses the rainbow in which she will probably pee on because that is how she rolls.

My cat has cost me a lot of money and time but I hope when I am old and peeing everywhere, that someone will take care of me and I will have two toilets in the same room. Did I state I will never own a cat again?

I hope this helps with anyone who has CP phobia and is willing to go above and beyond of getting rid of any trace of cat pee. I wish you well in your battle.

UPDATE AUGUST 27, 2017

Hello All,

Thank you for all the kind comments. I am thrilled my mania puts a smile on so many faces.

I received a personal email from the founder and CEO of this company thanking me for the review and offering a free bottle on the house. This is a small, family run business and I can not express how important it is to support these types of companies.

Since posting this review, I actually convinced a man to marry me. I clearly missed my chance as a saleswoman because I can sell anything, even a life attached to me and the feline. My cat is going strong and still a narcissistic princess with a special place in my heart and hell.

I want to add a few other recommendations to some of the qualms I have read in other reviews. As you may infer with my post, I am borderline OCD with cleanliness. I do squats at the gym just to master the hover technique over a public toilet. My advice is over the top but it works.

With any problem in life, you have to attack the source before treating the symptoms. Your decision to own this type of animal is the main source, the actual cat being second with their toilet being the third main source. After having a lot of self reflection on why you chose to own an animal that stalks you as if you were a gazelle and inevitably will latch onto the back of your leg while going for the achilles tendon to bring you down is the first step to solving cat pee problem. Then we move on to see if said cat is healthy and using the litter box. Finally we have to attack the actual cat toilet. Even when litter is scooped, it still holds the smell of cat pee. I change out my cat litter every 2 weeks and sometimes more. This means dumping the entire cat box into a black trash bag and then taking lysol to wipe the interior and exterior. This will help substantially in getting rid of cat pee smell. Again, attack the source, not just the symptoms.

Many have stated they are not fond the Rocco and Roxie cleaning smell. Cat Pee Smell is at the top of my offensive list which also includes items such as robot phone calls to my cell, McDonald's no longer frying their apple pies, hair in the shower drain, and taxes. When attacking cat pee, you have to neutralize the chemical composition of this awful smell. The enzymes in Rocco and Roxie deliver this result as best as I have seen. The after smell does not sit well with all. I use Rocco and Roxie with Oreck dry carpet cleaner every two months to clean my rugs and carpets. I admit I tire of the cleaning smell but have found a solution many may want to try.

After cleaning the pee and other items out of carpet, grab baking soda and some natural essential oils. I found a box of oils on amazon. Add tea tree oil and lavender to the baking soda. In fact, add whatever smell you would like for the olfactory. Add lots of drops to the baking soda and mix well. Shake this mixture all over the carpet. It needs to look like it just snowed. Get a brush, preferably with a long handle to protect your back, and agitate the baking soda into your carpet. Leave it on over night for best results and then vacuum. If you can't wait that long, at least let it sit two hours. Baking soda and the oils are all natural so safe for humans and animals. This step has helped in creating a more earthy and pleasant smell in my home when I do the manic bi-monthly cleaning.

Thank you again for all the responses and I hope one day to get a book published. As of now, I just update a file with favorite pics of myself and a pre-written obituary for my husband to publish in case my cat does accomplish her life long goal. Within the three column long obituary, I added few lines about being an ""expert Amazon Reviewer"". Sounds morbid, I know, but I can't trust my other half to use a decent picture of my face or remind the public why they will miss the Unhinged Crazy Cat Lay Who Is Not Fond Of Cats.

Kindest Regards,

It saved me and I seriously can't say enough good things about it!

I wanted something that was safe enough to spray indoors that wouldn't hurt my cats with chemicals, yet something that was going to be powerful to eliminate the spraying that some of them had randomly (after many years of living together already) decided they would start doing around my house. Being that I had more than one cat it was hard to detect which one the culprit was, and which of the exact areas of my house that they were ""competing for"" - all I knew is that I could smell it all of a sudden so it must be happening that one of them (or more of them) were mad at or with something - for reasons that I had tried everything to fix and figure out prior, to no avail. After a month or so - there were a few areas in my house that were clear that one or more of the cats had sprayed - I would clean the area's that were clearly used as a ""marking battleground"" with soap, vinegar, cleaning products - you name it, I tried it...literally nothing worked - the smell was ALWAYS still kind of there after I deep cleaned, and I swear my cats would watch me clean it and think ""yeah right, that's not going to work."" Sure enough, after spending hours cleaning, they would go back to that same spot the next day to continue competing.
It got to the point that no matter how hard I cleaned the smell just wouldn't go away no matter what I did, and I was starting to feel uncomfortable about finally being able to have people over to my house again since the pandemic...it was beyond frustrating.

I stumbled upon the Rocco & Roxie cleaner on Amazon (after spending hours over many days scrolling through options and reviews of other cleaners that claimed to do the same things that this cleaner does - none of the others that I had look at on Amazon seemed like they were going to be a good fit.) Then - thank GOODNESS, the fates led me to this cleaner - I read the reviews for Rocco and Roxie and all of the descriptions seemed to fit what I also needed it for, and seemed to have very satisfied customers after using it. I bought the small bottle and anxiously waited for it to come in the mail, (I really couldn't wait - hoping beyond hope that this worked...but not wanting to get my hopes up too high.) As soon as it was delivered to my house I seriously ripped open the box and tested it out....and folks it was seriously like someone waved a magic wand in my house - I went around the house spraying their ""usual spots"" that I had figured out, and it was like they were never there - the smell was gone (the few stains that were there - poof - GONE!) Thinking it was too good to be true, I waited for the spots that I used it on to dry to see if the smell was still gone and - it was that good - the smell in any part of the house that used to smell was GONE! I was so amazed that I started spraying some other spots in the house that I suspected but wasn't sure about. I went through the entire bottle in less than a day - spraying various spots in my house. Almost instantly the smell of pee and cat spray went away! All of my hours upon hours of cleaning over the last months hadn't even touched these spots from a smell standpoint and with one spray of this cleaner the smell in each part of my house - was gone - it was THAT easy!

Just as amazing, if not more - none of my cats are not in any way interested in going back to those spots any longer - and I haven't had an issue with them spraying or competing for ""their"" spots in the house since I sprayed it the first time - this cleaner also really does completely take out the scent that only cats can smell too, which make them go back to re-mark an area that they already marked to continue to assert that the area is theirs - none of them have gone back to any of the areas since I used this cleaner!

I have also used it on just about every type of material; hardwood, wooden chests, carpet, clothing, couch fabric, cabinets, outside - none of the areas that I have used this cleaner on have stained or look any different condition wise than they looked before I used it! I think that says a lot about the harmful chemicals that aren't in this spray and more to what has been scientifically put together in this spray to work against the science that creates any kind of smell in the first place.

The day that I received the small bottle in the mail, after going through more than half the bottle of it it so quickly - I immediately jumped on Amazon and bought the big gallon option. In the same order, I also bought a small, cheap funnel on Amazon. Whenever I need to fill the small bottle (which isn't often at all now, because it's gotten rid of the smell and my problem of my cats even trying to re-mark,) I use the funnel and put it at the top of the small bottle and pour the contents of the gallon jug of this cleaner into the small bottle so that I have the option of the spray bottle to ""arm"" myself with when I need it.

Whatever the makers of this amazing cleaner have created to fight the enzymes that the description explains that this cleaner fights (like others don't) really truly works - they have created something that they have truly tested and worked the Science of because - it WORKS!

I really don't need to use it at all much any longer (every once in a while one of the cats will try again in a new spot not used before and as soon as I find the spot - or smell it and seek it out - I arm myself with the spray bottle and douse the spot in this miracle cleaner and that spot in the house isn't even a thought to them any longer, or a smelling nuisance to me any longer.)

The cost might be a bit more than most of the cleaners out there but TRUST ME, if you're going through the same thing I did - or just need to get rid of any kind of smell (not just pet smells - though those are the worst - but this will work on ANY smell you have in your house) - Rocco & Roxie is WORTH it's weight in gold and then some - it's priceless! It does something that no other cleaner can do! It really does act tough on stains and odors and gets down deep to never make the offending smell a problem again.
I have even used it on my garbage can when it started to smell a little strange - I poured some of this cleaner in the bottom of the can, added a bit of hot water - scrubbed it a bit and voila - smelled as fresh and new as if I had just bought it!

The smell of the spray itself isn't offending at all either, (I actually think that it has a bit of a a floral smell,) it doesn't smell like chemicals at all and after a few hours you don't even notice that you even sprayed it - it just smells like your house again. It can be used on literally ANYTHING that has a smell and it will fight against whatever the smell is and whatever that smell has left behind to make that smell, as if it was never there to begin with after you spray this cleaner on whatever it is!

The piece of mind in knowing that I have this close at hand whenever I need it for anything, is SUCH a relief - it has saved me - my house smells like my own again and I can have people over without worrying that my house smells. If there is any kind of odor in my house caused by anything I know that this spray is just a few steps away to be able to solve it! It really is THAT GOOD!

And the makers of this cleaner are private sellers that aren't a big corporation - which I love even more - supporting a small business that is doing amazing things! You can tell they take pride in their product (I received an email after I placed both orders of this asking me to please let them know if I had any problems and to send any feedback if I had any because they take customer satisfaction very seriously - I don't doubt that for a second! )

Do yourself a favor and don't look further than this cleaner, spend a little more to get something that truly, truly works! You won't regret it and I can bet that you will be buying more of it like I did after using it for the first time, just so that you have it on hand! Bravo Rocco & Roxie Bravo!",positive

I rescued 4 beautiful stray kittens about 10 years ago and hand fed these beautiful little creatures round the clock. While they were the cutest little balls of fur you ever did see, they grew up to be the naughtiest cats with the worst habits. As they grew up, I don't know if they plotted behind my back to see who could make the messiest of messes, but they definitely won that battle hands down. We moved into a house that had prior chaotic cats because they would congregate to certain rooms and reek havoc. They took "" Tea Time "" to PEE TIME. I have searched the market, the same way they searched for a pee place like a pilot looking for the perfect place to land a 747! It was to the point where I considered starting a new career in sewing and fashion and make the ultimate cat designer line of leak proof, pee proof and shred proof undergarments, just for the murder mitten mafia squads with four legs running throughout our homes acting like fools, that act all sweet and innocent, but the brief moment our backs are turned, so are theirs, right up against the walls, with their tails flailing in the air and then we take off like were doing the 50 yard dash to catch them in the act and as usual, they've already ran under every piece of furniture at least twice, gone through 2 rooms and are hiding under something that we haven't seen the under side of since the day we bought it. So like me, you parade (up and down & repeat) the pet isle and the cleaning isle for what seems like an eternity because somehow you think there has to be something that you overlooked the last time you went through there, ( the day before ) and as usual, it's the same stuff that you've tried at least a half dozen times with zero success and why you ask, it's because there is nothing in those cleaners that deters them and if anything, it attracts them right back to every single mark they left behind and then after you have scrubbed and scrubbed your entire day away on your hands and knees reminding yourself how much you love them and have gone through more paper towels than a retirement home, your wonderful little furball comes in to inspect your hard work, goes over to their favorite spot, waves their magic wand and poof, you now have a sprinkler system...AGAIN! So you now find yourself right back to where you started from, at the store parading the same 2 isles and the cycle continues.. I did what most other pet moms did, I jumped online for products to resolve this issue once and for all and I began to read the reviews and listened to other pet parents stories and the more I read about this product, I asked myself #1- Is this stuff really going to work? and #2- Is it worth the cost? I figured that with all the positive reviews, what's the worst that happens, it's just like every other product that we tried at $5-$10 per bottle about 20 times.. So I bit my tongue and I thought go big or become the next top garment designer for cats, so I bought the gallon and I waited for it to arrive and that it did and on time and let me tell you, I was never so excited for a cleaner to arrive. I unearthed my shampooer from the closet, poured in the cleaner and away I went. I was skeptical at first as with every cleaner but that day, I became the latest and greatest magician because it all, DISAPPEARED! Everything that comes from a pet whether it be the smell and odor or discoloration of them marking that area, the pee in general.. It cleans it all, including the walls,
( just incase they waved their magic wands on them too.)
The strength of the cleaner is strong so open a window and maybe use a fan to air the room, but if you wet the area first with water and then go back over it with the cleaner, it breaks down the stain better and you save more cleaner by doing that so you don't waste any. I bought it and used it about a month ago or a little longer and there is no residual smell of the fur babies past bad habits, no lingering smell from the cleaner, it just smells fresh & clean. I am so glad that I took the chance on this company and their product because it is AMAZING. It also works on anything that can be laundered. Put some in a spray bottle, spray the mysterious area well let it sit for a few minutes and throw it in the wash and whatever it was will be just a thing of the past. If you have some naughty fur babies that forget their manners, this is one product you will be happy you bought. It saved my carpets, money down the road and definitely my peace of mind .. Happy pet parenting..",positive

Odor elimination? Absolutely. My family and I went on vacation for a week. We had a friend coming in feeding our cats but she wasn’t scooping the litter box, I didn’t really think anything of it because we have 3 cats each with their own litter box so I wouldn’t have expected them to fill them up so much. Boy was I wrong. What I wasn’t considering was that during that entire week, they were kept only inside (they are indoor/outdoor pets) and so the boxes filled rather quickly. One of my cats, the only male cat… is rather picky with litter. If his box is full, he will find other places to pee and that is exactly what happened. He went rogue on our couches with peeing. The house smelled awful because we all know there’s few things more potent than cat urine. I used hot water and soap and scrubbed the couches, nothing. We carpet cleaned the couches twice… nothing. I was desperate. I found this on Amazon and am so glad I did. This stuff is a miracle worker. We soaked the couches with it, let it sit for an hour as suggested, and then carpet cleaned it. The smell? GONE. I couldn’t believe it. And that was only with one cleaning with this stuff.

The other great part about this stuff? It tackles stains really well. I tried to attach some pictures for reference. Maybe you can see in these pictures, we first tested this product on just a part of the couch (the seat) and the next day… that one part of the couch stood out completely from the rest of it. Like night and day. These are beige couches and I have 2 kids, a dog, and 3 cats… imagine the stains they have. We didn’t even expect this to be so helpful with appearance too, just was looking for an odor eliminator but got a two in one with this product!

I can’t speak for if it’s helpful with potty training as my cats do not usually have any problems with not using the litter box except in situations as mentioned above. I can say that they haven’t peed there since spraying this on the couch, so maybe that means it’s also useful for future prevention, who knows.

So… the only bad thing I can say about this product and the ONLY reason I chose 4 stars out of 5 stars was the smell. I had to open all my doors and windows trying to air out my living room. I was actually worried for my kids to breathe this stuff in as the smell was so incredibly strong. I literally had to wear an N95 mask I had at the house to apply this stuff and it was so strong that I could still smell it through the mask, and N95 masks are pretty darn thick… if that tells you anything. The smell isn’t necessarily bad, it smells fine… but it’s just strong, way too much strong. So there’s the only downside I’ve found with this product, and ya know… I’d still recommend this to anyone and I’d absolutely buy again if needed.",positive

They didn’t follow the steps, obviously. I have a worse cat pee problem than all of you combined and this was the only- the ONLY - product that worked. Just listen. We just moved into this new house with plenty of space for our three cats. The two females and one male are treated with premium respect- each has its own covered litter box in its own location, each receives two healthy portions of raw food daily and at least 4 hours outside. They return eagerly when called. They are seemingly happy and content with our situation. The male cat is not ours, it’s my mothers, and we’ve been watching him for 6 months. When we moved, he began lining one particular wall in my office with urine. Upon further inspection with black lights, there seems to be a size able 1-2 ft wide strip of urine lining the 20 foot wall. There is so much that I am forced to conclude that he couldn’t have done it alone. We learned the previous tenants had cats, and we believe our male is lining this wall to mark over pre-existing urine. This is the only explanation I have, hence the pretext about how we treat the cats, and as a graduate of animal behavioral science I think I’m right on this one. So for the last month I’ve been coming home, sniffing the air at the front door (20 to 30 feet from the urine wall) and dawning my gloves angrily as I get down and clean the urine wall and underlying carpet with every cleaner known to man. I’ve used three bottles of urine gone, Resolve, natures miracle (cat and dog), water and vinegar, just vinegar, just water...I’ve tried scrubbing, stamping, vacuuming, blotting- all to come home to the smell that lingers. I’ve heard cat pee can end marriages and I see why now. Once I read that lady’s review for Rocco and Roxie, I said screw it and ordered a 32 oz bottle, hoping that the combination of enzymes and bacteria could make a difference. Let me tell you, IT DID. I thought the man vs cat pee war was lost, and I had almost given up hope. Problem is the volume. I used the entire 32 oz, let it sit for three or four hours, blotted thoroughly and then vacuumed with our specialized pet accident vacuum cleaner that has claws on one of the heads to penetrate deep into the shallow carpet. The smell is about 90 percent gone. So I begged my mom to buy the gallon for me, (it’s her cat after all) and we’re waiting for it eagerly in the mail. We run an air bnb in the house and we had a poor review because of the odor which was made one day before the original 32 oz bottle of Rocco and Roxie came. I’m hoping that a full gallon will be able to get rid of this. Thank you for making the only product that works.

And since these reviews are a good place for stories, I will tell mine. To explain.

Our cat arrived around a year and a half ago. For some reason, people tend to dump cats/litters of kittens off at my house. I live near open fields, maybe they think we're a farm, idk. Usually I'll just rehome them. One particular cat I took a real liking too. Very chill, easy going. Not needy. I took the usual steps to make sure no one was missing him. No chip. No claims to him on social media posts.
He was social, litter trained, stays off my counters, very tolerant of my little one. Probably dumped, like many others. I liked him so talked my husband in to letting me keep this one.
Soon I started to see exactly why he was was dumped. I have never known such a fussy cat in all my life. O.m.g.
First of all his stomach is incredibly sensitive. Every time he would eat, puke everywhere. Every single time. Ok. I did a bit of research and started buying a VERY expensive brand of cat food. Seemed to work. Cut the puking down by 95%. Ok.
After a while, he started climbing into the bathtub and kitchen sink. He would sit there and beg to be given a drink straight from the faucet. Would not touch the water bowl, no matter how often I changed the water. Just beg for faucet water CONSTANTLY. Drove me insane. The puking and the cat constantly sitting under faucets, incessantly meowing, was getting old. But by this time one of my older kids had fallen completely in love with this cat. I didn't want to break my sons heart and I didn't want him ending up at the pound or dumped somewhere else. So I problem solved by buying him a cat water fountain. Probably the most ridiculous thing I've ever purchased, but it worked. No more begging in the sink. Ok.
Moving forward, and the reason for me buying this product, his highness decided he was going to get fussy about cat litter. Every time I would replace litter with new, he would turn his nose up at the litter box and pee on the floor. Directly in front of the litter box. If I even added fresh litter on top of the old, pee on the floor. I started buying unscented cat litter. That did seem to make a lot of difference, but now I had an awful smell in my house. I tried every home made concoction the internet could come up with , every product Walmart offered, to no avail. The smell always returned. Nothing like waking up in the morning, walking out into the hallway only to be hit in the face by the smell of cat pee. Dont get me wrong, I like the cat. He is cute and fluffy and nice. But the puking, pet fountain, peeing in front of the litter box, stink was wearing on me.
Once again I took to the internet. I found a product called Angry Orange. Got good reviews. Seemed kind of potent. In those reviews I saw many people mention this product as well. Not wanting to deal with the smell any longer, I ordered both products. So if one didn't work, I could try another right away. I was desperate.
I decided to try this spray first. And then try the orange stuff if this didn't work. I haven't even tried the orange stuff.

This spray took care of it the first time used. Like, completely gone. Like it was never there. And since purchasing this product my cat has gone on the floor a couple of times (bc I had the nerve to scrub out the box and put all new litter, pshh). I've used this product right away, every time, and there is never a smell after. Some people complain about the smell of this stuff. But I honestly dont mind it. It smells like cleaner. Which is 100x better than the smell of cat pee, imo. And it doesn't linger. Once its dry, the cleaner smell is gone. Afterward there is no stain on the carpet. Absolutely nothing to indicate an incident.
Thanks to this product my son gets to keep his precious floof ball, (who I've named His Imperial Majesty, Mr. Swiffer the Fat. ) and I dont have to deal with that awful smell ever again. I will be buying a gallon of this stuff to keep on hand. It is expensive but its completely worth it.",positive

Growing up with an anxious cat who licked off all his fur on his torso and legs after my moving out, I would have never had to also throw away so many of my clothes had this existed.

My cat not only did anxious licking, he would spite urinate in my dirty clothes basket to the point my parents no longer let him enter that room.

My mother is extremely OCD about cleaning (who hires a maid weekly but insists on cleaning with them?), and always told me when it has been urinated on by a cat, it’s basically not salvageable.

Cut to after moving out….a roommate had a very neurotic female cat, and a stray, non feral cat adopted me and my then-boyfriend.

Mind you, this cat was neurotic from the day I met her in a one-pet household - for example, unprovoked, she bit the ex boyfriends thumb through his fingernail, so it wasn’t just the introduction of our lovely addition.

We noticed that awful ammonia smell near the tv - one of those 5 feet tall Boxy big screens - and proceeded to just clean it as normal, including renting a steam cleaner, etc.

The smell seemed to be getting worse, and as one roommate had a black light we started looking around the room in said area near TV.

We were petrified and in awe of what this cat was capable of. There were streaks of urine actually visible to naked eye but we hadn’t thought to check….all the way up the wall, above the tv and then some. She had to have parkoured up there and have some epic spraying power.

Obviously I bought all pheromone and enzyme products I could find, but there truly was no escaping it.

Current day: moved in with boyfriend not knowing one has a serious marking issue - and he’s neutered. There is another who is not *yet* neutered, but he’s the little guy and will be soon, along with a chill older female cat who is not the culprit.

Based on reviews (I didn’t even read the OCD cleaners review until after purchase), I ordered this and a few other products to deter this bane of my existence.

To make matters worse, I was blaming the little guy as he isn’t yet neutered. My apologies, little guy.

So imagine standing in the mirror in a robe and something wet on your bare leg. The middle one had been the culprit all along and decided he wanted to mark….me. Later, he proceeded to mark my boyfriend while we were all chilling on the couch.

The vet chalked it up to me moving in and stress, along with that he can urinate properly again, he’s makin his mark. shortly after moving in, he received a 2k price tag after I noticed he was behaving like my old cat when crystals in his urine caused bladder rupture & emergency surgery - worth it; he stayed with us many more years.

This guy doesn’t have that excuse as he’s been peeing on things for a loooong time it seems.

Enter this Rocco & Roxie stuff, holy wow. I threw a bunch of clothes in the tub, tossed a liberal amount in with warm water and let their grimy, oily, cat urine selves hangout awhile. Afterwards, I did a pre wash with a bit more and a long wash with a bit more product.

Not all the lingering urine smell left a few items, but if a cat pees on something you love, just try, try again. Miraculously ammonia-free clean stuff. I have yet to try it on carpet, and if a body spray for humans is ever available- sign me up.

Also, the smell of the product is truly not so bad. It does have a minty smell, but it’s not really too strong and much more pleasant than the overpowering, once invincible foe that is cat urine.

Now that I’m laundering everything like a madwoman I’ve had to purchase another gallon - it’s pricey for a reason and worth putting aside any unnecessary luxury purchases.

As the epic OCD reviewer says, you do need to reach the root of the issue as well - this alone will probably not stop the marking or random acts of urination outside the box until you know why. In tandem with other products, this is necessary to actually banish the scent.

Update: not only is the product amazing, the service matches the quality. I had a few delivery issues, and they were kind enough to send a little dog treat gift which my parent’s dog apparently loves. Thanks so much for giving me back my sanity one gallon at a time!",positive

Yes... BUT that's because there is nothing ""LIKE"" THIS STUFF!! I have 5 kids, 3 dogs and 2 cats so our carpet and furniture takes a beating. Decided to try this stuff after one of our cats urinated on our couch. SIDE STORY, for anyone without cats... Our old cat urinated on our couch and it had to be thrown out. It was that bad! Cat urine does not come out, that is until now. After our newer cat urinated on our couch this time I was desperate, I couldn't afford to throw out another couch. After receiving this product, days after the urine set in the couch. I sprayed it on, let it set, then used the house function of our carpet cleaner and BAM!!!! The smell was GONE!!!! It did smell like the spray itself (which isn't bad, just different) for a few days, but since then it has disappeared and you'd never know anything ever happened.

After it worked so well on the couch I decided to try it on the carpet. We had some stains that had been there for well over a year. Even after multiple carpet cleanings and using different stain removers (which didn't work). So I again, sprayed, let it sit, then used the carpet cleaner and WALLAH the stains were gone!!!

I hate the price tag, and honestly, if you're dealing with set-in stains (I was dealing with my cat pissing in one room in protest of me studying abroad for a month) you might want to just bite the bullet and get the gallon size. I know its painful. But you're underestimating how much they piss.

To those reading the reviews and feeling uncertain about the strong scent of the cleaner, listen to me. You want that smell. I've used an enzyme cleaner before and while it did alright, it actively made the place smell 10x worse before it got better due to the process of enzymes breaking everything down. I bet the strong minty smell is to cover that process up, and if you're using a gallon of the stuff in a small room on a month's worth of cat pee, please trust me, you'd rather it be mint than even worse cat pee smell. Additionally, I was using a black light to find the exact spots and treat them, and I found that it did actually remove the black light stains if an area was soaked thoroughly enough and I really did everything I could to soak it back up after letting it do its thing. Many towels were sacrificed, but it was worth it, and when I vacuumed everything later, the stains were gone. Note that this was a dry vac, I don't have a wet one. I think a wet one would probably work better, but mine absolutely did work too it just took a lot of manual effort to soak up the liquid first.

My bottle was defective and had a bad spray cap, every time I would spray it, rivulets of liquid would come streaming out of the cap. This led to my hands being coated in the stuff, and they got red and itchy for a little while and it took 3 thorough hand washes with soap to get the weird feeling off of them. I contacted the seller's website and they were responsive and immediately helped fix the situation, and even asked for the lot number to make sure it didn't happen to anyone else. 10/10 customer service.

Anyways, my wallet hurts but my room is piss free; I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.",positive

Not when they pee all over your house!!! I acquired the yorkie when my mom passed away 9 years ago. The yorkie is neurotic and despite getting trainers and literally spending almost a year taking the fur ball out 8-10 times a day, she would still pee on the floor. After years of this, I finally gave up and resorted to pee pads. This worked until she developed kidney disease and now drinks more than her body weight in water only to have it promptly come out the other end. She no longer seems to care whether she hits the pad and I literally spend my days cleaning up urine, fecal matter and barf from this animal. Despite people raving about Natures miracle... I discovered immediately that it did nothing to rid the smell deposited by this 7 pound peeing machine! I tried Clorox, Resolve , Furry Freshness, and the list goes on and on. I finally decided to try Roccos and was SHOCKED at how well it worked! I have resisted writing a review because I honestly believed it was too good to be true and that at any moment the smell would return. But after 4 years of using it (over 6 gallons worth), I feel it's finally safe to say the smell is NOT coming back!!! Does it have a strong smell when using it? Yes... quite a bit.

My husband and I are sleeping without two dogs in our bed for the first time in 9 years. We purchased two 22” crates for our 2 year old Yorkie & our 9 year old Maltese, and started with a plan.

Day 1- assemble the crate, find a quiet yet central location, shut the door and leave their favorite dog treat inside the empty crate. Let the dog sniff and explore the crate. Do not let the dog go inside today.
PS. For two dogs, we placed the crates next to each other.
Day 2 - open the door and encourage the dog to get the treat “In your place”, and then let the dog leave quickly. Praise your dog. Shut the door and add another treat to the empty crate. Quick training day.
Day 3 - repeat Day 2 twice today, and leave the door shut with a treat inside the empty crate for the rest of the day. No staying in the crate for more than a few seconds. Praise your dog. Another quick training day.
Day 4 - open the door and encourage the dog “in your place”, then get the dog to lie “down”, give another treat when they obey, and shut the door with the dog inside. Sit close by for one hour (good time to read emails or text friends about your dog training success). Give a few treats if the dog stays quiet. Let dog out, quickly shut the door, and add a treat to the empty crate. Praise the dog.
Day 5 - at bedtime, encourage the dog into the crate “In your place”, then to lie “down”, & give treats. Lock the door, cover the crate with a towel or blanket leaving the front not covered. Say goodnight, turn off the lights, walk away quickly, and enjoy your first dog-free sleep.

The first night, our Yorkie barked after 8.5 hours and she definitely had to go outside. I took her out and returned her to the crate for another hour. Now both dogs can easily last 9-10 hours.

We don’t use the crates during the day, unless we have a worker in the house. And we always leave the crates locked during the day with a small treat inside.

NOTE: We do provide lots of exercise after dinner and ample visits outside before bedtime. This helps with longer sleep for all of us! 💕

Hope this helps you and your pup. Our pups enjoy their special places (especially with treats!). I’ve tried dozens of treats but the best for us have been Tricky Trainers since they are small and tasty.

Good luck, and remember your dog will feel safe and comforted in their crate.",positive

I would probably buy another, because I've not found anything better. But know, these aren't what they used to be.

I purchased the MidWest iCrate Double Door 36"" size.

And makes this a much safer crate. I would highly recommend replacing the tray. It's worth the money. I wish MidWest would just offer a stainless steel tray option from the start so customers didn't have to go through the hassle of measuring and ordering from another company.

A positive change that I noticed is that the 2 newer MidWest crates I ordered (this one is one of them), they didn't have a super strong chemical outgassing like some have had in the past. I was able to open the box and set them up right away. As someone with respiratory issues, that was very much appreciated.

She’s 9 weeks old and only used the puppy pads and outdoors for potty, 0 crying in the crate and never soils in it, took 5 days to achieve it. It does Attach to the widwest play pen fence. I feed my dog her meals in there and keep all her toys so she feels like it’s a nice place to be. She’ll take her naps in here by choice and if I find her falling asleep to nap I’ll move her in there so she feels like it’s the sleepy time area and sometimes I’ll close the door and occasionally lock it to show her just because she goes in there doesn’t mean it’s bed time or I’m leaving. I leave the door open into the play pen when I’m at work so she has more space. Remember you still gotta take them potty, they physically can’t hold it longer than they are old when they’re little, 1 month= 1 hour of holding it. My puppies 9 weeks (Pomeranian, smaller breeds have an even harder time holding it cause they’re sooo much smaller) I typically stop giving her water 3 hours before sleepy time, helps her hold it longer like a big girl and i make her last meal about 6 hours before sleepy time, gives her time to digest and make poopoo on the backyard lawn for potty training. She has a flat bed to lay on, and a fleece blanket that’s circled around it to feel like it’s nesting, I leave in several toys so she’s not bored (a plush, a hard chew, and a soft chew toy). Before I go to bed I leave the fence side unattached where shelll need to be exiting to go to the backyard, I also leave my outdoor shoes and a jacket by the door, it’s best to be fully prepared to help them get outside ASAP so there’s no accidents, I also make sure my jacket and shoes are on before I open her crate, if he covers coming off I need to be ready to open that door and move. When I go to sleep I set an alarm for 4 hours while she’s crated (they need potty breaks when they’re younger) when I wake up I just have to uncover her crate with a blanket and open the crate door and she runs straight to the backyard door and we go out for immediate potty time. Do not greet your puppy when letting them out, it makes them excited and they might have an accident or not make it, they also might get distracted outside and forget to even go potty being excited or trying to ply and wait till your back inside instead to go. After we go potty we come back in and she has her breakfast of wet, dry, and raw frozen food and I refill her water. I gently and silently pet her while she eats it, it helps her not feel food aggressive while older to have hands around her and touching her while eating, if she finishes it all I give her a little extra till she’s full. After she’s finished eating I clean out the food tray and close the pen and leave her crate door open for her and I finish sleeping my 8 hours while she can nap, or have access to the play pen and potty pads for peeing. Her crate time is over and the older she gets the longer she’ll be able to hold it for, so the longer her crate time will be naturally. It took my puppy 2 days to stop crying when being crated, the key is to not give in the the crying and whining. I stand in the the other room where she can’t see me, whining is fine, barking is not. As soon as she starts being loud I say no, quiet in a stern serious voice until she stops. Took 3 tries before she stopped and I could go lay down for sleep. Took 3 more days after that for when to stop crying when I leave her in the pen to go back to bed.

Day 1- assemble the crate, find a quiet yet central location, shut the door and leave their favorite dog treat inside the empty crate. Let the dog sniff and explore the crate. Do not let the dog go inside today.
PS. For two dogs, we placed the crates next to each other.
Day 2 - open the door and encourage the dog to get the treat “In your place”, and then let the dog leave quickly. Praise your dog. Shut the door and add another treat to the empty crate. Quick training day.
Day 3 - repeat Day 2 twice today, and leave the door shut with a treat inside the empty crate for the rest of the day. No staying in the crate for more than a few seconds. Praise your dog. Another quick training day.
Day 4 - open the door and encourage the dog “in your place”, then get the dog to lie “down”, give another treat when they obey, and shut the door with the dog inside. Sit close by for one hour (good time to read emails or text friends about your dog training success). Give a few treats if the dog stays quiet. Let dog out, quickly shut the door, and add a treat to the empty crate. Praise the dog.
Day 5 - at bedtime, encourage the dog into the crate “In your place”, then to lie “down”, & give treats. Lock the door, cover the crate with a towel or blanket leaving the front not covered. Say goodnight, turn off the lights, walk away quickly, and enjoy your first dog-free sleep.

The first night, our Yorkie barked after 8.5 hours and she definitely had to go outside. I took her out and returned her to the crate for another hour. Now both dogs can easily last 9-10 hours.

We don’t use the crates during the day, unless we have a worker in the house. And we always leave the crates locked during the day with a small treat inside.

NOTE: We do provide lots of exercise after dinner and ample visits outside before bedtime. This helps with longer sleep for all of us! 💕

Hope this helps you and your pup. Our pups enjoy their special places (especially with treats!). I’ve tried dozens of treats but the best for us have been Tricky Trainers since they are small and tasty.

Good luck, and remember your dog will feel safe and comforted in their crate.",positive

200,Pet Supplies,Meow Mix Original Choice Dry Cat Food,$9.49 - $57.79,4,"Over the years, I've found all of my cats preferred Meow Mix.

Still you'll notice if you check around that many cat owners say the same thing. I have always supplemented my cats' diets with other foods as well, but this is the product I leave down at all times for them. They have all lived a long time and healthy lives consistently. So, if you are on a budget, I think don't feel so bad if you end up having to use Meow Mix, because your cat will probably like it, and probably do fine on it.

I'll never be certain. My dog is 11 years old. He started limping on his rear left leg after getting up from the couch. He refused to sit squarely always leaning his weight to the right -- off his left haunch. He'd walk fine though after getting over the initial stiffness and limping. It seems like arthritis. I gave him some rimadyl (dog equivalent to ibuprofen) which seemed to help. But I didn't want him to take it daily for a chronic condition, because it hastens kidney failure. I researched various glucosamin/chondroitin products trying to figure out which products seemed best -- best price, best ratio of active ingredients, etc. I decided to try this one. Well after months of stiffness and limping, and occasional use of rimadyl for acute pain, I started to administer COSEQUIN to him. I followed the 2 pills for 6 weeks guidelines. He's been on 1 day now for almost a month, so about 10 weeks total. In all that time he has not had any stiffness from standing up from resting. He is no longer sitting off to the side all the time, and he's back to his old self outside -- chasing rabbits and squirrrels.

Is it the Cosequin? I can't be 100% sure, but I believe so. I'd have to take him off it to see if the limping and stiffness came back to the leg. Not something I feel like doing to my little buddy. 2 stars for flavor because I tried one and they're absolutely nasty, but he loves them and gets excited to take his daily chewable.",positive

Our vet recommended a very expensive prescription med, but after several months, he showed no improvement at all. I saw Nutramax Cosequin on Amazon, read some of the overwhelmingly positive reviews, and tried it out. He's a little guy, so he got half a tablet every day with his morning food. And about 5 weeks after that started, we noticed his limp was completely gone! I'm sure it happened gradually, but it was one of those things where we suddenly realized - he was no longer limping.

Anyway, he has switched amongst flavors and style of foods. There have now been times over the last year that I’ve had to buy so many various brands and flavors just see what might be even a bit appealing. There are so many styles to choose from.

He’s on an appetite stimulant for an intestinal condition, preventing calories to be absorbed effectively. He had gone from around 11.5 lbs to a weight of just over 7 lbs. since then, exactly a year ago, his Fancy Feast varieties have helped him get to his current weight, mid-9 lb. range. We owe that stable weight gain and maintenance at least in part to his favorite brand - Fancy Feast( dry, wet, treats, broths, etc)

And bottom line, even though he will now enjoy some of the others varieties of fancy feast or even other brands/ flavors, I can usually always count on Him eating at least some of his plate of its Fancy Feast.

240,Pet Supplies,"Benebone Wishbone Durable Dog Chew Toy for Aggressive Chewers, Real Flavors, Made in USA",$9.62 - $33.87,4,"***EDIT 3: I have upgraded this to four stars. I received two replacement JUMBO bones after the one I purchased broke off almost instantly. I think that product had a defect in it, which is a little dangerous because it broke into a piece that could be swallowed. HOWEVER, the two replacement bones have been excellent. One got chewed up first, and it did slowly whittle away, but it did not break into any dangerous pieces and it did not get sharp. My puppy loved it! The second bone she has had a little more trouble chewing away, and it still gets her attention after months of hard chewing. Which makes me think that the bones have different hardness levels in the batches they are made, but that is just speculation. Regardless, the bone is great and does does not break into little pieces which could be choking hazards, and it does not get sharp.

Great product, a little inconsistent in batches maybe, but it will get your dog's attention, provide hours of chewing, and the scent does not get on the carpet like other chew toys or bones. Good purchase!

***Edit 1: Benebone contacted me almost immediately and offered a replacement of the larger size. Their customer service representative has been friendly and I forwarded my contact information through their website for the replacement. I will update when I receive the new product and my experience.***

***Edit 2: When I contacted Benebone's customer service to provide my address, they immediately responded in approximately an hour. In fact, they already sent and I received not one replacement, but TWO replacement bones and a nice handwritten note. I have attached a photo below proving it. The replacements were the LARGER, upgraded sizes too! I have upgraded this review to 3 Stars premised on the sincere and strong customer service they have shown me. THIS COMPANY STANDS BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS. For that, I think it is just to upgrade my 2 star review to 3 stars. I still stand by what I had said below regarding the smaller size, but so far my puppy LOVES the JUMBO Benebone and I will surely review the JUMBO in two weeks to see how it holds up. So far, the JUMBO is 5 STARS for sure; it has held up much better than the other chew toy, despite my puppy's intense chewing on this bone (it smells much stronger than the little bone and the flavor must be super intense for her). Despite this intense chewing, the bone has taken very little damage from her--it is holding up much better.

ADVICE: Do not go by the weight recommendations and size. If your puppy/dog prefers to chew on hard bones, just get the largest size for 100 lb dogs. If your puppy chews on hard bones once in awhile but not really, then you can go for the size for 70 lb dogs. I still think the 70 lb Benebone I got had a defect which resulted in one branch completely falling off immediately--the other two branches are solid despite heavy chewing--but this new JUMBO bone is amazing!

***Original Review*** - 2 Stars

I purchased this for my 45 lb, 8 month old pit bull/shepherd mix. It is a good idea and design, but one whole end was destroyed in no time. Perhaps I got a defective one with an air bubble or crack, as you can see from the photo below that one end completely broke off/wore down but the other two ends are barely damaged despite my puppy's chewing.

Regardless, I feel a little mislead that it was rated for dogs up to 70 lbs and, while the packaging warns you that this is just an estimate, one who anticipate that it would last longer than a week for a puppy 25 lbs lighter than the estimate. Nylabones and elk antlers lasted much longer than this did and my puppy seriously chews on the elk antlers quite intensely.

As way of some background, my puppy has a lot of chew toys ranging from bones, rawhide, ropes, stuffed animals, nylabones, and rubber balls. She certainly spent a lot of attention on this toy the last week, but it wasn't exclusive and her chewing was shared with some of her other staples.

I like that this toy has bacon mixed in with it. If you smell the toy, particularly where your dog has been chewing, you can kind of smell a meaty aroma. It does not get on the rug or rub off, and it is a faint smell, but on the chewed parts you can smell something. It is not noticeable when you are sitting next to your dog/puppy and the toy, or near the toy; it is only when you pick up the toy and put it right to your nose. I can only imagine what this smells like to dogs with their super sense of smell!

I also can't argue with the design/shape of the toy--it's perfect! The curve of the toy is great, as she can scoop it up or put pressure on one end to elevate the opposite end to chew on it.

But I just can't get over how quickly that one end came off. I got it about two weeks ago and I gave it to her last week (I slowly introduce new toys to keep her occupied and her mind stimulated). Compared to other chew toys--including nylabone and elk antlers--this toy wore down much quicker. In fact, the nylabone she has had for much longer, the puppy nylabones nonetheless, have outlasted this toy and the nylabone has been around since we first took her home at 2 months. She has also had an elk antler which has also lasted much longer and she REALLY goes after that one.

I have attached a photo below of my puppy and the damage to the bone. For the cost, which is about the same as a nylabone, I would have wished it lasted much longer than it did--which is why I got it in the first place as opposed to another nylabone. I would be happy if it lasted a few months, which is what I would guess to be its normal lifespan.

I would not classify my puppy as a big chewer either. She certainly chews and can do damage to hard bones or chew toys, but she is by no means a destroyer--she does not even shred her stuffed animals and has executed only a few (some were not even dog chew toys but children's toys she was given to play with). This is the first hard toy she has destroyed where I had to take it away.

CONCLUSION: Perhaps I got a Benebone that had a defect, or my puppy really just destroyed this one in a mere week, but I simply cannot recommend this version of the Benebone I got. I might try to get the jumbo Benebone or one rated higher for bigger dogs up to 100 lbs if they go on sale, but I don't think that my 8 month old puppy should warrant a toy for dogs up to 100 lbs when she has not destroyed any of her other toys like this one. It even takes her longer to go through some of the large rawhide toys she has!",positive

She is a TOUGH chewer. I am always afraid of choking or other hazards but this shape is the most ideal for her and her size. She is around 55 lbs and could chew on this for hours. I got her the medium size.

She gets a new one every month. And I know that can seem like frequent replacement but the photos say to replace as soon as the numbs are chewed down and i admitting wait a little longer.

242,Pet Supplies,"Benebone Wishbone Durable Dog Chew Toy for Aggressive Chewers, Real Flavors, Made in USA",$9.62 - $33.87,5,"We bought our young Bull Mastiff/Shepherd mix one bacon and one chicken. Her last benebones lasted about 8 months - but we buy her two at a time. I saw her with the remains of one of them yesterday that was big enough that I wasn't worried about her having it, but small enough that it's going in the trash next time I see it. It is a year old. She keeps hiding it.

I like the benebones for her. She is a chewer with powerful jaws. This helps to keep her from chewing up and swallowing sticks and other things that could really hurt her. Our other dogs each have one as well although they aren't big chewers so their's last a lot longer.

They last a long time, the dogs love them, we have never had any problems. If you have a chewer, I highly recommend.",positive

Please note this toy is made of nylon so it wears out and frays rather than breaks apart. That can be alarming for some people. That being said, according to Benebone's product wear/replacement timeline it is getting close to where they recommend replacing. This is after only a month of chewing where he only chews maybe every other day, so I feel the longevity is an issue. Ultimately I am conflicted as to whether or not I want to spend approximately $20 a month on replacing a nylon toy when I can get a pack of retriever rolls or an antler instead that last a little bit longer. I do however find it to be a durable toy that lives up to the company's description.",positive

As with any new toy you give your animal, be a responsible pet owner. It’s easy to take it away when he’s chewing more aggressively to avoid choking, biting off chunks of plastic, or hurting his teeth. We never leave this with our pup when he’s home alone. Just pay attention to your dog when they’re playing with this bone and everything will be just fine.

They use these balls like chewing gum, and the balls hold up to it extremely well. I don't know if it is a size thing, but as they walk around the house chewing, the balls don't seem to ever really take any damage. Sure, we can hear holes in the balls blowing out air, but for whatever reason, the dogs either don't try to or can't find a true break to start shredding.

They are also fantastic on the beach. They fit perfectly (of course) in the chuck-it thrower thingies and they bounce beautifully on hard packed sand. They float, and are easy to see in the surf. If you use the chuck-it, they fly a country mile.

If your dog likes tennis balls, I think they'll like these; only they won't hack on the fluff they pick off, and I can't imagine they will be able to damage them any more than mine can. Each of our chuck-it ultra balls has lasted through what would probably have been 20 tennis balls worth of abuse, and they are going strong.

They are pretty big though. Luckily, they're basically stinky food play-do. I break them in half, and just mush them around the pill and he's none the wiser. And they STINK. It's not a bad thing... I think it's part of why he likes them so much. But it was a shock when I opened the bag.",positive

268,Pet Supplies,"GREENIES Pill Pockets Natural Dog Treats, Capsule Size, Chicken Flavor",$7.62 - $37.90,5,"I have been using these Greenies Pill Pockets since they first appeared on the market, several years ago. I have to say that this is one of those great ideas that was just waiting to happen, Greenies is to be praised and commended to the heavens above for actually developing the idea, and producing the product. Canine owners everywhere owe an enormous debt of gratitude to Greenies.

In the far distant, and wretched past - giving pills (capsules and tablets) to ones faithful friend and loyal companion was something to be feared and dreaded, by both parties involved. This was an activity to be greeted with the enthusiasm that accompanies toe-nail trimming day (Another great idea out there waiting to happen, someone please find a way to remove the terror of toenail clipping time from the hearts of both man and beast.). However, with the advent of Pill Pockets, life is sweet again, tranquility rules supreme, and both owner and fur buddy can now be at peace with the world, and with each other.

These pill pockets are ingeniously designed little cup-like appearing objects, they are round or oblong (Depending upon your choice of the capsule, or the tablet version of the Pill Pocket), and have much the texture of fresh Play-Doh, that has been warmed in the hands until soft and malleable. The composition of this material appears to be something that holds tremendous appeal for ones happy dog, who no longer flees in terror at the mere sound of a rattling pill bottle.

One takes the pill or capsule, places it in the cavity of the Pill Pocket, then squishes the Pill Pocket closed, into the desired shape for the canine in question. By this point in time, your friendly canine has picked-up on the tantalizing aroma of the Pill Pockets, and is probably quivering., shaking, possibly offering to shake hands or to lie down........anything that will enable the Pill Pocket to be quickly introduced into the gaping maw of the pet in question.

What a relief, no more chasing the pet down, cornering the terrified animal, wrenching its jaws open with brute force, and somehow (Hopefully.) jamming the pill far enough down the throat of the violently resisting pet in order to clamp its jaws shut again, massaging its throat all the while (And somehow managing to keep a firm hold on the pet through all of these machinations.), and hoping with all ones heart the the pill has actually been swallowed, instead of being cleverly concealed in the corner of said pets mouth, only to be violently ejected as one releases the beloved fur kid, and watches the rear portion of the pets anatomy as it rapidly, and with great agility disappears to places unknown......this causing a repeat of the entire wretched, and disheartening procedure..

Well, those days are over. Pet owners everywhere can rejoice in their new lives of ease and happiness, while at the same time not being subjected to the reproachful and betrayed glances of their beloved fur kids. Just place the pill in the pocket, hand it to your happy and panting buddy, and the job is done. Everyone is happy, your best friend has just enjoyed a delightful snack, and is probably begging for more, and the pet's human is enjoying the relaxed atmosphere, and the lack of bitten and mangled hands and fingers that were the inevitable, and unavoidable result of the other positively medieval manner of pet medicating, in days gone past.

I maimtain a ready supply of of both styles of Pill Pockets at all times. When the package begins to run low. I immediately dash to my trusty computer and order more, via Amazon Prime. The brilliant geniuses at Greenies are to be commended, upon bended knee for their dream of an invention, which maintains tranquility in the hearts of both man and beast.

These Pill.Pockets are best stored inside of their closed bag, which is then placed inside of another zipper plastic bag, this ensures that the Pockets maintain their pliability, and the aroma so pleasing to the olfactory senses of canines everywhere.

These Pockets are not cheap, but I would rather go without food for a week, than to have to resort to the hideous pill-giving methods of days of yore.These Pill Pockets work, they do what they say they will do, and they help to maintain your peaceful, loving, and adoring connection with your beloved fur kid. I recommend these most highly, just the absence of mangled and chewed fingers is worth the price alone, not to mention the happiness and peace that you are granting your pet through the use of these wonderful Pill Pockets.

DISCLAIMER:
( Upon spell-checking this glowing review, it occurs to me that I probably should mention that I have absolutely no connection to the Greenies Pill Pocket people. I have no .idea of where they are located, or any knowledge of them, or of any of their employees or associates. I paid for these with my own hard-earned cash. No freebies, coupons, or gift codes were involved in the purchase of these Pill Pockets. I am just a really grateful dog owner, and a survivor of too many years of what used to be the sheer misery of pill administration to my beloved canines.)",positive

270,Pet Supplies,"Purina Pro Plan Sensitive Skin & Stomach, High Protein Dry Dog Food",$18.98 - $167.99,5,"This is a new review with more information. Purina Pro Plan was recommended by my dog’s breeder and my dog loves it. He is always checking his bowl and actually leads me to his dish if it’s running low.
HOW DOES YOUR DOG LIKE PRO PLAN SALMON AND RICE?
Pro Plan Salmon and Rice was my dog’s favorite flavor until I ran out for a few days. During that time, he ate Pro Plan Chicken and Rice and now he wants them both with a slight preference for the Chicken formula. Whippets can be picky eaters, but my dog eats more food now than any whippet I’ve ever had.
WHAT’S IN PRO PLAN SALMON AND RICE?
Pro Plan Salmon and Rice contains salmon, barley, rice, oatmeal, canola meal, fish meal, beef fat, dried yeast, sunflower oil, chicory root, fish oil, amino acids, omega and linoleic fatty acids, vitamins A, E, and C, calcium, and dried bacillus probiotic culture to improve digestion.
Salmon and Rice is about 42% carbohydrates (starches), 26% protein, 16% fat, 12% water and 4% fiber. There’s a good portion of accessible protein which I think is important. Overall, I like the ingredients.
HOW IS YOUR DOG ON THIS DIET?
Poochie is energetic — he always wants to play and run. His bowels are regular, and his breath had no odor when I checked this morning. His coat is smooth and thick (for a whippet). He has never had skin itchiness, ear problems, constipation or vomiting (unless he eats grass).
HAS YOUR FOOD HAD MOLD OR INSECTS?
I never had such problems with this food. When the package arrives, I check to see if the bag is damaged and I check the use-by date — if they are not right, the food is sent back or dumped.
I only buy enough kibble to last for 2 months, so it is never sitting around in the bag. When new food arrives, I take it out of the bag and transfer it to clean, air-tight polyethylene tubs that stay closed unless I’m taking food out. When the food in the tub runs out, I empty the tub, wash it in hot water and soap, and let it dry thoroughly.
If the bag is torn or sits around open, mold can affect moist kibble, flies can lay eggs in exposed dog food, and grain moth/beetle eggs can hatch out if the food is past its due-by date. Even if you transfer the food to a tub, it has to be closed air-tight to keep molds and insects out.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE PRICE?
Premium dog food is expensive, but I think it’s worth it for my dog’s health. Compare ingredients and nutrition percentages (especially protein) in Pro Plan and veterinary brands with cut-rate dog foods in grocery stores, pet stores, and feed shops, and you’ll see where the money goes. And don’t buy huge bags to save money, because dog food sitting around at room or garage temperature can go bad (see above).
HOW DO I CHANGE MY DOG’S FOOD?
If you want to try changing to Purina Pro Plan, the next step is to order a small bag and see if your pooch likes it and does well. Dogs are careful, so start with a full bowl of doggie’s old food and gradually stir in the new stuff over 7-10 days so he has time to get used to it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
I’ve fed my other dogs Eukanuba and many other brands over the years, but I’m liking Purina Pro Plan the best right now. If you have been using and liking Purina Pro Plan, you already know what I’m talking about. Whatever you ultimately decide, I recommend that you stick with premium brands by major dog companies and avoid faddish gimmicky foods — then you’re sure to be all right.
Feel free to click my name for other products and reviews. I’m always on the lookout for good things.
I hope this review has been really useful to you and your dog. Enjoy!",positive

The package has a zip lock to keep them fresh, there are sizes to fit the dog, and the vet was surprised how well their teeth looked last they went. It's our routine now.",positive
