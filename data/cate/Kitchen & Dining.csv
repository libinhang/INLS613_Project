0,Kitchen & Dining,"YETI Rambler 10 oz Lowball, Vacuum Insulated, Stainless Steel with MagSlider Lid",$15.00 - $67.28,5,"This is a great cup, and although it’s not 100% leak proof I would not expect that with lid styles like these. It does prevent big messes if accidentally tipped over but isn’t easy to tip over anyway. It feels good in the hand, looks smooth and durable and is great for any beverage you can think of.

Some of my favorite features are:

1. Mag slider, its awesome because I can remove it and thoroughly clean the lid. No trapped funk!

2. The press in lid. It’s a strong seal and no awkward thread aligning issues. Not too hard to remove and easy to clean! Keeps pesky cats out of my bedside water too.

3. The lip of the cup is smooth. I like drinking from the cup as much without the lid as I do with the lid.

4. it’s a good size, not too big that I wouldn’t want to put wine or a cocktail into it, and not too small for coffee or tea. I like a lot of coffee and tea and don’t mind having to refill this more often. My pour over fits over this perfectly too..

5. The copper color, while not bright copper fits in well with my decor, and looks classy.

6. Great insulation! I haven’t tested exactly how long things stay hot or cold but I did scald my tongue about an hour after making tea..

So take extreme caution with hot beverages!",positive

I was finally able to drink liquid again. This cup was the perfect size for the cold brew pods I found, it was easy to add the right amount of liquid. I would have the nurses fill the cup halfway with ice each night before bed, then in the morning I could add the coffee, creamer and water to make the perfect cup of iced coffee, and it stayed icy cold for hours as I slowly drank it. I still use the cup now, even though I am home and able to do everything I could before getting sick. It also keeps a hot coffee hot for hours.",positive

They keep cold things cold for hours. Beverages don’t get diluted because the ice doesn’t melt quickly. They are indispensable if you are outside and about.

15,Kitchen & Dining,THERMOS FUNTAINER 10 Ounce Food Jar,$11.88 - $39.38,5,I love it keeps the food hot for a long time. Advice is to pour boiling water in the thermo to activate first then put your food in there so it stays even hotter longer. Perfect size. Lost the spoon though and wish I can buy another but I don’t see any online.,positive

First she loved this design which was fun and very girlie which she loves. So far it has shown to be leak proof and very easy to wash. The portions are perfect because she would leave some uneaten food before I started using this but with this she either eats everything including snack time and if she leaves anything it’s very little food. I also liked that this wasn’t as heavy as other similar products and easy for her to open and close. I would buy more in the future and would recommend to others.,positive

She is an extremely picky eater and it's a good format for her to use - big section for a protein and grain, small sections for fruit, veg, healthy fat (olives usually) then she gets to put a ""dessert"" in the sauce cup (a gummy worm or a few m&ms). In the 5 years we've used them we've purchased maybe 12 boxes - the seals do wear out after a year or 2, but I put them in the dishwasher so that's mostly on me.",positive

She loves the little unicorns (of course!) but I think it was especially warming because over the past week everything was about her brother starting school and she was being left behind. So when I sent his bento box for his school lunches, she looked on disinterestedly, but then SHE got one and everything changed. She was so happy! I could tell it meant a lot to be remembered.
I like it bc she can now feel special at her OWN lunchtime, nothing will leak out since each compartment is sealed, and it’s just the right size for different sized foods, and if she wants to eat out at the park in the Texas heat, at least I know it will keep things the same temp they were packed in. A cool pack could be added too for longer hours.
I just enjoyed her reaction. Consider getting one to make someone you love feel great!",positive

Not because anything is wrong with the previous two, but because these are my favorite when it comes to packing his lunch. He’s not a real “hungry kid” so large portions aren’t his thing. He would rather have a large variety than quantity. Bento is perfect for that! They don’t leak, he can open and close it easily, and they’re dishwasher safe. I suspect in the near future I’ll acquire two more so we have one for every school day!",positive

Variety is not one of our strengths right now. Getting him involved in packing his lunch has helped somewhat. And the fact that he LOVES the graphics and Bentgo, in general, is awesome! This summer is his first experience with summer camp and he’s required to send a lunch each day. After doing some research on our options and talking to some other parents, I decided to spend a little more and purchase the BentGo and coordinated lunch bag. Knowing he’s not going to be a huge fan of school lunches, camp gave us an opportunity for a trial run. So far, he’s only allowed two combos: ham sandwich with pringles, berries, spinach leaves and ranch; and chicken nuggets with ketchup, Mac and cheese, and berries. The cold foods have been fine with the little rocket ice packs in the bag. He said the Mac and cheese and nuggets got too cool. (But he still ate it all. 🤷) We haven’t tried anything liquidy other than the ranch and ketchup, but they both stayed put without leaking into any other compartments.
Finally, clean up is easy. I haven’t put the removable tray into the dishwasher, but hand washing both pieces is quick and easy. We will definitely be looking into other items made by the same company.",positive

I’m so glad I picked this one! She’s in 2nd grade and it is a perfect size. She’s also loving it! I make sandwiches for her usually, and cut them into two or fours, with some fruits and crackers and/or chips, and maybe a little treat.",positive

(We have 6 of them!?) They are the perfect size for us! Typically a 1/2 sandwich, pasta or rice with chicken in the big spot, cheddar bunnies, strawberries and blueberries in the smaller spots and 2 animal crackers for dessert in the dip spot… b/c she’s not a dipper! They are easy to clean and I love removal tray. Sometimes she needs to eat on the go and the tray is perfect for car seat lunches!

Finally, my product got some mold that I wasn’t able to remove and they sent me a new box! It was easy and I LOVE LOVE LOVE great customer service! They also gave me tips for avoiding this issue in the future… which was user error to be honest. Make sure not to leave food in there overnight or use Goad Press and Seal for easy clean up!

It didn’t leak, even when we packed apple sauce for her lunch. As we prepared for her to enter PreK4 this year, we noticed that the sealing liner on top of the lunch box was starting to fray and although it wasn’t leaking, we called Bentgo to inquire about a replacement sealing liner. After explaining the issue and sending in pictures they notified us within a day that they would be sending a replacement lunchbox within the next 2-5 business days.

30,Kitchen & Dining,THERMOS FUNTAINER 12 Ounce Bottle,$12.10 - $38.40,5,"These are the only sippy cups that legitimately keep drinks cold and milk from spilling in my car. My car does not smell like a milking parlor gone rogue anymore! They fit perfectly in car seat cup holders and stroller cup holders (Sorry Contigo, you know I love you!). Plus the handle is nice to strap onto a carabiner and hook to a bag or purse. Great for little hands with great themes. The only thing I don’t like is the graphics come off within a year, but I guess it means they are well loved and washed regularly 👍🏻",positive
31,Kitchen & Dining,THERMOS FUNTAINER 12 Ounce Bottle,$12.10 - $38.40,5,"Got 2 of these- one for my 2.5 yo and one for my 10 month old. They both use them with ease! The bottles keep water cold for long periods of time, the straw is very easy to get water out of, holds up in the dishwasher, and also holds up to being dropped repeatedly (accidentally because, toddlers LOL). Way better than some other stainless steel bottles we have. My toddler nephews have this same type (but they have the fun printed ones) and they also love them. Can’t wait to use them at the zoo and Disney World. Highly recommend.",positive

They hold up super well despite drops, they don’t leak, and they’re easy for young kids to open and close. I’ve had the same ones for years, I just occasionally buy new straw replacements for them. One tip- Mine were leaking for the longest time and I couldn’t figure out why. Make sure when assembling you pull the straw (that you drink out of) up really hard. It will kind of pop. That stopped it.",positive
33,Kitchen & Dining,THERMOS FUNTAINER 12 Ounce Bottle,$12.10 - $38.40,5,I got this on a back to school sale and it's is amazing! My daughters drink is still cool when she gets home in the afternoon.

He loves it. Fits nicely in his lunch box and side pocket of back pack. My 2yr olds often snatch, run off with and sometimes throw it as hard as they can. Seems to still be holding up perfectly. Very easy to clean. No leaks so far.",positive
35,Kitchen & Dining,THERMOS FUNTAINER 12 Ounce Bottle,$12.10 - $38.40,5,"My little one has a slight tongue thrust. Since this has a straw mechanism and not a sippy cup style spout, it promotes an appropriate swallow and tongue posture. Over the last 6 weeks we’ve incorporated some oral motor work to also address this issue and it is resolving. I am also a pediatric speech therapist.

The container only leaks when you hold it upside down, as my daughter likes to do so the water will drip into a container of her choice for her to play. Great container. I recommend it to my colleagues and clients.",positive

It’s really easy to clean AND thank you Thermos for selling the replacement straws!!!! Even with water inside, it’s not too heavy for my almost 2 year old to hold herself. She can also open and close the top by herself. I like the straw is clear so you can tell if inside of the straw is not clean and when it’s time to replace.

40,Kitchen & Dining,"Bentgo Deluxe Insulated Lunch Bag - Double Insulated, Durable and Water Resistant Fabric with Interior and Exterior Zippered Pockets and External Water Bottle Holder- Ideal for Children",$24.99 - $35.50,5,"We have for YEARS used the pottery barn kids lunch boxes because my oldest loves the matching patterns for her backpack and lunchbox and liked getting her name on it. This year we dropped the ball and didn’t order in time so she had the option of getting her normal pottery barn things after the start of school, or getting something different so she chose to get something different this time.

After years of trying to put our bentgos into the PB lunchboxes and having zero extra room for a water bottle or juice box or anything, so I’d end up SHOVING her water bottle into the side water bottle pocket and she could never get it back in after lunch. This lunchbox is amazing. I can fit her bentgo (she uses both the kids version and the bentgo fresh) with a juice box or water bottle inside and another snack, with 2 cold packs. And even if I had to add more than that, the water bottle pocket is a soft mesh with a drawstring bungee so it’s SO easy to get bottles in and out.

The normal handle has a clip so you can clip it on a backpack (a feature we thought we’d miss from not having the PB lunchboxes, so we love that) and it also has the front handle so you can carry the lunchbox flat, so if you have a bento inside, the stuff won’t get as sloshed around and stuff. Sooo nice.

Not to keep comparing it to PB, but that’s what I have to compare it to. I am BLOWN AWAY by the quality compared to PB. You can tell just by touching it, the material is nicer and will hold up much longer, the handles seem better made, and the insulation is DRASTICALLY better, like it makes me actually sad I spent almost $50 each time I got one of those stupid things and just spent $24 on this or whatever the price was, and it’s so much better.",positive

You need to put the back edge of the rover in first, then gently pull the front corners of the lunch box out to settle the front edge in. If you can train your kid to do this, it'll probably work great for school. If your kid isn't patient enough and just jams it in, the edges of the rover are likely to tear up the inner silver liner of the lunch box. Other than the tight fit, this thing is gonna work like a dream. (Fingers crossed it may stretch some as the school year goes on.) Nice and sturdy. Good insulation. Lots of carry options. Space for an ice pack and some extra snacks, and the drink carrier on the side. I'd love to see it 1/4"" bigger all the way around, but this was the best solution for our rover that I've found besides the overpriced bag you can get straight from PlanetBox. If you own a Bentgo box, you're definitely gonna love this thing since the spacing will be better.",positive

Does the job and arrives as pictured. However it does not fit a lunch box and snack box (all of same brand and line). We can squeeze it all in but it makes zipping a bit more challenging for a 5 year old. It seems illogical that the same brand wouldn’t make a bag to fit their own products. We bought this specifically so that everything would fit. Also the outside of the bag had a few clips that look like they would work with a strap but no such strap came with it. A feature I would suggest adding to future models is a smooth name tag area where a sticker tag will attach properly. We added one to the inside and we will see how long it stays on.,positive

I had also bought the backpack with the bit at the bottom but the school wanted the kids to separate their lunchboxes out so the backpack hadn’t been used in the way I had hoped (to put it all in one bag) the dog print bag is super cute and it’s definitely well made. The only thing I would have liked is to have a little extra room in the bag once the bentgo box is inside it. There isn’t enough room to pack extra items in that section and the zip section where I usually put her treat or crisps/chips is super tight so I’m always worried they will crush in the side pocket.

However, I decided to see what packing a school lunch would look like. This provides the perfect amount of space for the bentgo box, a drink and a few extra snacks for my 5 year old. It is large and it looks even bigger watching him carry it, but I think the size is necessary. The strap was awkward, so we did remove that and he just carries it by the handle.

50,Kitchen & Dining,Simple Modern Reusable Wide Mouth Stainless Steel Flask Thermos,$14.99 - $56.99,5,"So far this is only the second day I've had this water bottle, but I had purchased one previously for my husband in the 32oz size and knew it was a good water bottle! I also have the galaxy simple modern tumbler and love it, so when my c0ntigo fit bottle developed a large dent in the bottom and would teeter and fall over, I knew it was time to get a new one and was ready to get myself a simple modern bottle! I had a really hard time deciding which color/size to get, as I'm used to 32oz, but wanted the variety of lids the 40oz provides, and I do come close to running out of water at the gym, so I went ahead and got the 40oz size. There are so many lovely options to choose from with color and print that I had a really hard time deciding! I was torn between the lavender mist and sea glass sage, and ultimately went with the sea glass sage because it is such a LOVELY color! It is 10x more beautiful in person, and the fact that it is more matte/pastel, I LOVE that! The lid being the same exact color makes the bottle look so much more sleek, like it is high-end. When I look at this bottle sometimes I see grey, sometimes blue and sometimes green. It is such a unique and eye-catching color, im in love with it. Now as far as being leak-proof and all that, it pretty much is. But you have to make sure the cap is screwed on tightly or some droplets can sneak out. The bottle is pretty big, and looks giant in my hands, but i love that because it means i have to refill less, and yes, it keeps your water cold for quite a while! I mean, dont expect it to hold ice all day or anything, especially if you dont fill the bottle up with ice first. But it does do a great job at keeping things cold! All in all, super impressed and hoping it stays that way. I'll update if anything changes but so far I'm just in love with it!",positive
51,Kitchen & Dining,Simple Modern Reusable Wide Mouth Stainless Steel Flask Thermos,$14.99 - $56.99,5,"To start off, I will say that it doesn’t appear to keep liquids ice cold for insanely long periods of time, that said, I love this water bottle. This is a great and affordable alternative if you are looking for a large double insulated hydro flask type bottle.

I love the options for lid types and it’s super easy to clean. Plus it looks so nice!

I have a hydro flask that has a really hard angle at the top of the bottle which makes it super difficult to clean. The Simple Modern bottle has a nice sloped angle inside the upper rim of the bottle which makes cleaning so much easier.

I don’t love that it’s hand wash only, but that is expected especially with a super affordable double walled water bottle.

Bonus review of the company: I had received my bottle with a slight chip in the enamel. I reached out to simple modern’s support and they sent me another bottle right away. That 2nd bottle came and was obviously dropped during transport and had a pretty decent dent on the bottom. I was bummed thinking that was it for getting a proper replacement, but I reached out just in case and they instantly sent another to make it right. I am still waiting for the delivery, but I am so impressed with how easy it has been to work with the company. I have no doubts that I will receive a bottle in perfect condition, but will update the review if not.",positive
52,Kitchen & Dining,Simple Modern Reusable Wide Mouth Stainless Steel Flask Thermos,$14.99 - $56.99,5,"Yeah...so this is a great bottle. Picked it up as a backup to my usual for a trip to Europe because I wanted one to keep in the car. Great design, keeps ice almost completely frozen even in a hot car. Absolutely no complaints about the bottle itself.

However. It is vacuum insulated and the one I got did come with a straw lid. Both of those mean you need to unscrew the cap to release built up pressure when taking it on a plane. I forgot about that little issue and am now typing this on my phone mid-flight while half-soaked. Water spurted a good six inches in the air before I managed to flip the top down again. Great indication of a good seal, but really not the kind of demonstration you need. Learn from my mistake. Unscrew the cap (carefully!) before using the straw if you take it on a plane.",positive

It's possibly my favorite thing I've ordered on amazon, and that includes our TV (sorry TV, I still love you too). The pattern is super cute, I get tons of compliments all the time. It's also durable, and holds up to frequent washing. Its skinny and tall, holds the same amount of water as a plastic disposable water bottle (as a point of reference), and it fits perfectly into my wrangler cup holder too, if that's helpful to anyone. Just snug enough to be confident its not going anywhere, even with the top and doors off at 70 mph. If you're on the fence, don't be, it's worth every penny. I don't go anywhere without it, and I've never been that way about a water bottle ever in my entire life.",positive
54,Kitchen & Dining,Simple Modern Reusable Wide Mouth Stainless Steel Flask Thermos,$14.99 - $56.99,5,"We have owned Simply Modern water bottles for several years now.
We purchased the bottles for us and our kids as they have multiple varieties, colors, and sizes.
I replaced mine with a new one because it had taken too many falls and wasn't keeping the water cold as long as it used to. The water would be warm after about 12 hours. Usually, if the bottles are filled with ice and water, the water will stay cold with ice for 24-36 hours, and just cold up to 48 hours (If your are not drinking the water and refilling it).
The water bottles look great, they can take a beating and still keep liquids cold.
These are our go to water bottles and they are worth the price.
We highly recommend them.",positive
55,Kitchen & Dining,Simple Modern Reusable Wide Mouth Stainless Steel Flask Thermos,$14.99 - $56.99,5,"I started out w the 18oz in light pink which was great bc it fit nicely in my hand to drink & I could slide it in & out of my bag easily. The only issue was that I drink a lot of water so I was having to refill it a lot. When I lost it, I wanted to go up one size for less refills. I accidentally went up 2 sixes thought and bought the 32oz. The only thing I liked was that I had to refill way less (even when I waited overnight, the water was still always ice cold). However, that size was too fat for my hand to wrap around it comfortably & it was also really hard to fit in a bag. FINALLY after losing that one, I got the 22oz and it’s PERFECT! (I feel like Goldilocks writing this lol) but for real, it has the same circumference as the 18oz, but it’s taller so it can fit more water (less refills!) As w the other 2, the leak-proofing could use some work, but as long as you don’t keep it laying on its side or upside down, you’ll be fine lol. Also, the Nebula design is GORGEOUS!!

My first Simple Modern bottle lasted me about 4-5 years, and it still works great! It is a 32oz straw lid in the color Seaside. Despite its age and use, my husband took it out for golf ~8 hours, and when he returned home, the ice was still rattling inside! I bought a second S|M bottle on Prime Day, a 40oz in Blush. It came with 3 styles of lids, but the straw lid is my favorite. The bottle insulates amazingly well, I have had ice in this bottle stay solid for almost two days. My only complaint is the straw lid can be hard to clean around the spout, where it pivots. I have not researched the best way to clean it, but a white film can start to accumulate around the spout, even where I do not put my lips. The picture does not really show it because it is my new bottle. It's amazing quality for the price. I would love to buy the S|M beverage tumbler once I can drink coffee again.",positive

I have been equally as impressed with the cute blue water bottle I received. It absolutely keeps my water cool all day, is easy to hold and drink from and doesn't leak all over the place. The only thing that I would change is it won't fit into my average-sized cup holder in my car, but I'm sure if I had gotten a smaller size that wouldn't be an issue. I'm not sure if the water bottles are dishwasher safe but I have always put the coffee cups in the dishwasher and other than some light color fading, they've never had any other issues. It's not quite Yeti-level but it's as close as I've found and it is so much more affordable!! Definitely worth the purchase, especially if you haven't tried any of their other products yet.",positive

Its clean, easy to use, convenient and way less messy than the regular Wide Mouth Screw Top Lid can come in handy too. But the Straw Lid... sucked by not having any suction! lol.

The company does replacement lids in other colors, which is really cool. But I wish they sold more lids in this sage color. I love how the bottle and lid match. Gives a clean, modern look and feel.

I bought this scale to have easy access as I am not a chef and I am not going on a “diet” —- it is to help reduce inflammation for better health and comfort. I have followed recipes closely and I have measured for a diet now and then, and I am normal weight but have learned this requires keeping my trigger u healthy foods out of the house and can eat my sweets as a restaurant, for example,

I’m not a cook that doesn’t need measuring and I have two other scales that I will utilize in what is essentially making a life change. Similar to how autoimmune diseases change your LIFE. So, the best to do is make a life change to facilitate my gradual yet steady change of what goes in my body.

I have always resisted a scale because I just use my measuring cups. My baked goods always turned out great.

But wait!!!! I was wrong. I had a recipe that provided all measurements in ounces. I broke down and bought this scale. Put my container on the scale, pushed the tare (zero out) button and measured out 7.72 ounces of flour. This is 1-3/4 cups. COMPLETELY SHOCKED that my measuring cup was over 2 cups. So many different factors played into this, but I had an accurate measurement on the scale.

Once you put any dish of size on there, you can't see the numbers. I have to squat on the floor and look eye level with the counter to see the digits.

So although I didn’t end up keeping this scale because I wound up buying another one before it was all through, I think it’s safe to buy from this company and you may very much like it. Although I will ended up with a different scale, the XO that has an extendable display but costs 3-4 times as much and isn’t as “sexy” and sleek looking, I still changed the review to four stars bec of the customer service. And the scale is likable. And it’s safe to buy from them. Because you can actually reach the customer service and they are responsive.
………….

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I very much like the slim, stainless steel, sleek profile of the scale, I like the width of it for placing a bowl on it, and I really like how the buttons seem simple and easy to operate.

I bought from this company because the customer service seemed good in the reviews.

Unfortunately, the digital kitchen scale unit was never accurate from the day I bought it. I always treated it gently, as I do all my things, kept it in his original plastic sleeve and cardboard box when I stored it in my kitchen cabinet in between attempts to use it. It certainly never was jarred or fell so that can’t be the argument for Wyatts in accurate.

I wasn’t sure how to prove to myself whether or not it was accurate, but it seemed INaccurate from the very beginning.

It took me over a year to figure out how to — duh! — take it to thr grocery store where I purchase bulk spices. As they weighed each bulk bag on their accurate check out scale, I re-weighed it on my Etekcity digital scale model EK6015, and indeed, the scale was wildly off.

I tried calling the phone number inside the product box, but they don’t accept messages.(Argh!!! I hate it when customer service does that, by the way!!!) Their outgoing message said to use email and expect a reply in two days.

I will update this review when I have their reply and find out how they handle the customer service.

As long as the customer service continues to be good, I look forward to trying another version of the scale, and expect it to be accurate. If not, I will be very unhappy and will let my recommendation of one star stand.",positive

70,Kitchen & Dining,"BlenderBottle Classic V2 Shaker Bottle Perfect for Protein Shakes and Pre Workout, 20-Ounce, Cyan",$8.79 - $27.46,4,"I bought this primarily for protein shakes like most buyers I would assume. It seals very tightly allowing for vigorous shaking (note: some seniors and those with flexibility/mobility issues or injuries might find popping the cap off a bit of a challenge). The shaker ball does a fine job of blending powders into liquid bases but occasionally small berries and chopped fruit and other ingredients can get stuck in the ball though this is not a serious concern if you chop to size or keep small fruits like strawberries whole and avoid the minor inconvenience.

I took one star off for having to wash the container quickly after use to avoid picking up “off” odors. I have had to wash it several times in a row to rid it of strange smells when I’ve kept it in the fridge overnight or taken a shake on the road where immediate washing isn’t possible. Just wash in warm soapy water right away and you’ll be good. It is dishwasher safe, top shelf, but I don’t like food grade plastics in the dishwasher’s heat and chemicals cleaners so I hand wash my shaker.

I recommend this product for its value price but remember to clean it fastidiously. 😁",positive

I returned the nalgene because it was delivered cracked on both sides. The side walls were very thin. This giant blender bottle seems sturdier and more durable. I use it as a giant water bottle/pitcher that i leave in the fridge for cold water. It serves its purpose well enough. It is durable and sealed. The spout is big enough that I don't have to take off the lid to refill from my water dispenser. It is easy to clean like any blender bottle. It is tall, but it sits well and balanced. It is perfect for my use case.

My only issue is the lid. It does take some force to open and close the spout. It doesn't open and close as easily as its smaller counterparts. I find that I have to really apply some force to pop it open and snap it shut.",positive

Also, if you are a macho man who likes to force everything, the lid seal might leak after awhile. I turn slightly past initial resistance and have no issues.

Really like the unit. Throw in the whisk, mix, and 3-4 ice cubes, shake 50-60 times, and you get a perfect ice cold mix every time.

Only downside is that bottle starts to smell bad from the protein if you do not wash every time, which is to be expected. Wash and it goes away. Bought two more so I could throw in dishwasher top rack. Whisk does not accumulate any protein, which I was concerned about with the ""paddle"" type mixers.

80,Kitchen & Dining,Bentgo Kids - Leakproof Children’s Lunch Box,$26.90 - $36.98,5,"If you're on the fence about which bento box to order for your child (BENTGO KIDS or YUMBOX), I will compare the two brands in this review. My family has used both kinds for about a month.

**BENTGO KIDS**

My 5 year-old kindergartner takes this box for his lunch, and it is truly the better choice for YOUNGER CHILDREN in my opinion. It has a more juvenile color scheme, five small food compartments, DURABLE RUBBER TRIM on the top and bottom, and overall exudes a higher quality product that will withstand more abuse than the Yumbox. The latches are more HEAVY-DUTY than the Yumbox, and although it can be a bit difficult for kids to close at first (it's a tight seal around the inner tray), my son got the hang of it after a couple tries. The Bentgo Kids trays come in three different colors and seem more durable than the Yumbox trays.

The Bentgo Kids box doesn't hold a LOT of food, but it is plenty for my son, and I imagine it will provide ample food until he's in second or third grade (probably a good box for 3-8 year-olds?). The largest compartment will fit a half sandwich unless your bread is huge, but then you can just cut it in quarters. The Bentgo Kids shell is a bit larger than the Yumbox, so it's a tight squeeze into my son's soft-sided LL Bean box, but we manage to fit the Bentgo and a Lifefactory water bottle into the LL Bean box.

*UPDATE* - We recently purchased an LL Bean Discovery lunch box, and this easily fits either the Bentgo or Yumbox as well as a water bottle and extras. The Bentgo also fits in a Lands' End ClassMate soft sided lunch box with a Goodbyn water bottle (see photo).

Does the Bentgo Kids leak? Nope. The rubber gasket on the lid is impressive, and ranch dressing has stayed neatly in the center dip compartment. The gasket on the Yumbox doesn't seem to be as good, so this is another reason why I like the Bentgo Kids better for younger children. It's pretty much foolproof. To clean, simply remove the inner tray and put it in the dishwasher. I always hand wash the outer shell or at least give it a wipe-down each day.

**YUMBOX PANINO**

I purchased this Yumbox Panino for my 9 year-old third grader. I like the Yumbox Panino colors and design better for OLDER CHILDREN (maybe 7-12 year-olds?). It's less juvenile than the Bentgo Kids box, and the Panino version has room for a larger sandwich. Since its tray has thin dividers, it will HOLD A BIT MORE FOOD too. The Yumbox has a slightly SMALLER FOOTPRINT than the Bentgo Kids, and it fits snugly in my son's LL Bean lunch box, but his water bottle does make his lunch box lid bulge out - not a big deal. We have since upgraded to the LL Bean Discovery lunch box, which is much deeper and has plenty of room. If you only have room for a small, narrow water bottle, the Goodbyn bottle is a great option (found on Amazon).

We have packed ranch dressing in the center, and as long as I press down tightly while latching the lid, it doesn't leak. The inner tray has printed text underneath (they are not removable stickers), but it does have a more grown-up look to it than the whimsical designs on other Yumbox trays. Yumbox sells plain trays on their website. The tray easily snaps out for washing in the dishwasher, but we always wash the outer shell by hand.

FOUR compartments or SIX? Yes, Yumbox offers two different versions - same size, but the trays have either more or less compartments. I debated greatly over which to buy, but ultimately I decided that the Panino (4 compartment) style would grown with my son better than the 6-compartment Yumbox, and on days when he doesn't pack a large sandwich, I simply use silicone baking cups as dividers. Links to the cupcake liners and leaf-shaped food picks shown in my photo are at the end of this review.

SUMMARY:

Both boxes have different features, so the box to choose really depends on your child's needs. The YUMBOX PANINO is my favorite for OLDER CHILREN or those who eat larger lunches because of the tray design and color combinations. The BENTGO KIDS is terrific for younger kids as it seems MORE DURABLE yet holds plenty of food for little ones. I do wish the Bentgo Kids box came in more colors, but perhaps this is in the works. For now, my son enjoys using his different-colored trays to switch things up a bit.

February, 2017 UPDATE:
My second grader is still using his Bentgo Kids nearly every day, as it holds more than enough food for his appetite.

Kids like it because the 5 compartments allows for more variety of foods to be packed. At our house we put ketchup in the middle circle compartment if needed for lunch, or a small sweet treat like a marshmallow (totally makes their day!). you can buy an extra tray with clear cover if it helps to make 2 lunches at once and save one for the next day.

86,Kitchen & Dining,Bentgo Kids - Leakproof Children’s Lunch Box,$26.90 - $36.98,5,This school year my babies asked me to pack their lunches. I needed something reliable and found these online and I am in love!! The portion sizes are small but big enough to fill the kids up. There are 5 different sized compartments so I get to get creative with the snack choices. It’s super easy to clean and I don’t worry at all about leaking. It’s microwave and top shelf dishwasher safe. And the colors are so cute!! We plan on doing a video with these everyday to show what’s for lunch that day and I’ve already been asked so many times about them.,positive
87,Kitchen & Dining,Bentgo Kids - Leakproof Children’s Lunch Box,$26.90 - $36.98,5,"My 4 year old daughter LOVES her new lunchbox! She loves the color, being able to carry it without spilling, the compartments, everything. She even wants it for her meals at home!

For the parents, I could not believe how much it holds! In this pic, I fit the following:12 pieces of pepperoni, a cheese stick, 2 big mushrooms, 2.5 big florets of broccoli cut down into smaller pieces, 3 big strawberries, 6 raspberries, 6 cucumber slices, and a pack of fruit snacks. (Note: this is more than she usually eats in a sitting, but she likes to have lots of options). So far, it seems very sturdy, easy to clean and store, no leaking problems, the perfect size for her to carry (especially when we put it in a bag), and not too heavy. I'm very glad that we chose this lunchbox!",positive
88,Kitchen & Dining,Bentgo Kids - Leakproof Children’s Lunch Box,$26.90 - $36.98,5,I got this for my kindergartner. It was his favorite part about going to school!!

102,Kitchen & Dining,"Bentgo All-in-one Stackable Lunch Box Solution-Sleek Modern Bento Box Includes 2 Stackable Containers, Built-in Plastic Silverware, Sealing Strap",$14.88 - $24.97,4,"I switched from the skinnier bento boxes to these and love them. But after using them for a couple of weeks there are some improvements that I think can be made.

1. I've noticed that over time the lids, for both parts, do not fit perfectly. This makes the bento box a little less secure and makes me worried about putting anything like fruit that might leak a little into the container.
2. The stretchy band gets dirty. After eating my lunch I always put the bento box back together and just throw it in my bag. When I got home I realized that there were stains from the food on the band. This isn't a huge deal but because the band has plastic on it, I don't want to wash it in the washing machine so I'd have to hand wash it somehow- just an extra hassle. Also, the band has become more stretchy over time so I'm afraid that my food isn't as secure as it was in the beginning when using it to close the containers.
3. The top box (with the two compartments) are not separated completely when closed. I put fruit on one side of the box and some chips on the other but when I opened it, my chips were soggy. I realized that the lid and edge in between the two compartments does not create a seal food as large as nuts can be shifted from one side to the other when closed.

Overall a good idea but just some improvements that I think would make this the perfect lunch box!",positive

I wouldn't put anything in this that might leak (I put my dressing in a small disposable cup with lid) as I'm almost certain it will leak. Cleans really well. Small enough to carry or put in a briefcase/satchel/bag. I'm enjoying it and like the convenience.",positive

I really like the concept and how everything is together. I don’t have to send a bunch of separate containers. One issue I have is the top split container doesn’t seal between the two sides. I had cantaloupe in one side and goldfish in the other to take on a zoo trip. We opened the top and the goldfish were soggy from the cantaloupe. So I guess nothing like that can go in the top and can only go by itself in the bottom which is inconvenient since a cut up sandwich fits great in the bottom.
I like it, but wish it was more leakproof.",positive

I knew it had to be about the size that it is because I use a Jansport Half Pint backpack for work (I don't need to carry much, usually just lunch, water, my phone and ID), and this Bentgo box fits perfectly. I was really surprised to have it fit so well next to my 32 oz. Hydroflask in the main compartment, so now I have a great way to take lunch to work. Thank goodness, because I was seriously nickel-and-dime-ing myself buying lunch in the employee lounge.

Literally the only complaint I have about this is that there is a little mixing in the top compartments if I don't pack it right, due to a gap between the center wall and the lid. Not a huge issue unless you *really* hate your grapes mixing with your peanut butter stuffed pretzels (for example); I just use a paper towel to keep one or the other from wandering across the compartments. Otherwise, I would recommend this container to anyone of any age who needs one.",positive

The negative reviews about kids not stays on is total lies it has a silicone the top lid to help with leaks and the strap helps even more. And very easy to clean. I clean by hand.,positive

Now when I first received this product, I loved it; I found the silverware compartment in handy. Before I got this, I would always forget to bring some. Now I don't have to worry about forgetting a fork or spoon. I liked how it all fit together; it was snug. Nothing really shifted much because of that reason. Although, after a couple of washes, the lid did not want to fit correctly, I was kind of nervous about using it because I thought the food would spill out. After this happened, I reached out to Bentgos Customer Support, and they got back to me quickly. They are currently sending me a replacement, the fastest customer service team. I usually wait days to hear back from other customer support teams. Overall very happy about my experience.

With these, I can buy things in bulk, pre-pack snack boxes, and have grab-and-go quick and convenient options for the everyone. This particular size (4 compartment snack box) might be small for an older kid or adult for a whole meal, but they are perfect for recreating cracker/cheese/meat/nut/etc combo boxes. They are also considerably less expensive than the $3.00+ of similar items from the grocery store, and I can fill them with much higher quality ingredients. The boxes themselves are made of a sturdy plastic; they are not at all flimsy or cheap in quality. Unlike some other 'reusable' boxes I have tried, these actually are likely to be long lasting and reusable. Total win. Very happy.",positive

I have a 4 year old who is really picky so I will put 3 things he likes along with something new. The portions are small so he doesn't feel intimidated to eat it and I just give it to him while he is playing so he can snack when he feels like he wants to. The lids work great and wash easily. They do take some time to dry but that's really it. I don't think this would work well for my older child unless it's just for snacking or sampling.

The 10 pack is great because they can “meal prep” it and have it readily available for when they want an after school or a grab and go snack. I thought they would be flimsy, like the take and toss Tupperware’s but they are a little more durable. (Think of it as twice the thickness.) I bought the clear ones so they could see through the boxes and know what’s inside without having to open the lid. Fits crackers, cheese, pepperoni perfectly! Will definitely be a lot cheaper than constantly buying lunchables and those Sargento balanced break snacks that cost almost $2 a box!",positive

One container came was a crack in one of the quadrants so I usually put a dry item in that.
I’m not sure if they’re leak proof when the lid is on as I haven’t tested for that.
They’re also great for dipping sauces! Recently had chicken nuggets and fries for dinner. Ketchup, honey mustard, ranch, and bbq. So much cleaner and easier than a bowl or plate.

The meat, cheese and fruit did too but the crackers you cant wipe off. There was a lot of water sitting inside the containers.

You put the little wax beads into the cup, and then you set the cup in a pot of boiling water. It floats and conducts heat without melting the silicone-like a charm. Clean-up is also super easy. The only drawback is that the color does get a bit funky on the outside of the sleeve due to the hot water interacting with the porousness of the silicone.

140,Kitchen & Dining,"HOST Cooling Cup Set of 4 Plastic Double Wall Insulated Freezable Drink Chilling Tumbler with Freezing Gel, Wine Glasses for Red and White Wine",$3.99 - $75.74,4,"The description and information on the box states that this margarita glass holds 12 ounces. That may be a stretch of the truth. Perhaps the entire glass INCLUDING the outer walled section that is filled with the gel holds 12 ounces -- but there is no way you will get a 12 ounce drink in this glass! I filled the glass with water up to the rim and poured it into a measuring cup. The max amount this glass holds is 8 ounces. I subtracted 1 star for mis-information in the description.

However, the claim that the glass will keep you drink cool for hours IS true! I filled the frozen glass with water and ice cubes (my ""test margarita"") and timed how long the gel would stay frozen and the drink remain cold. I still had gel ""ice"" frozen inside the wall of the glass, and the ice cubes I placed in the water were still frozen at the 2.5 hours mark. I then tested an ""on-the-rocks"" margarita, followed by a frozen drink. The on-the-rocks still had ice after 2.5 hours and was not diluted. The frozen margarita did melt a little bit on the top after about 1.5 hours, but the portion down within the walls of the iglass was still in the ""slushy"" frozen state.

The glasses are easy to hold, and they are a bit cold, but not as cold as holding a glass glass. The little rubber ring at the base does help protect from the cold glass somewhat - but it's pretty small. After a margarita or two, you should not feel any pain anyway! :)

Despite the fact that the glass holds less that advertised, I am keeping them. They are sturdy and can be stacked for storage. I like the fact that they are acrylic, too!",positive

I found this Bentgo Box Kids Chill lunchbox and have been packing small portions of healthy finger foods for my daughter and she has been loving her lunch each day! Perhaps it’s because the colorful foods in the box look so pretty, or maybe it’s the “cute” portions, whatever it is, it makes her look forward to eating her lunch and she eats almost all of it! I have no doubt that if I packed the exact same foods in snack baggies she would not eat them. This Bentgo box is perfect. It’s very well made, good to look at, and easy for my 4 year-old to open and close.

He was able to open it easily on his own, unlike the other bento boxes. 3. Built-in icepack. Definitely a plus and allows for extra space in the lunchbox. 4. Super durable. One year later and their lunch boxes are still in excellent condition. 5. the perfect number of bento boxes. My kids don't care for dips so the ones with the dip thing in the middle are no use for us. Overall, this was an excellent purchase. I also bought the lunch boxes to go with this and they are holding up strong as well. I don't actually have to buy new ones for this year because they still look brand new almost a year later.

The regular bentgo has much more ample space.
Also wish the lid opened fully to 180 degrees to lay flat. This is again a trade off as that may take more space...but for little kids at least in our experience it's easy to topple the container with the lid at an angle (by mistake or on purpose) making messes more frequently. Or to drop the lid down on tiny fingers by mistake.

I feel the need to address this as so many people found this users review helpful so it unfortunately misguided potential buyers. This lunch box is not a refrigerator, you can not take room temperature food, put it in the lunch box and then expect the lunch box to cool the food down from 70 degrees to 40 degrees. That is essentially what this user expected the lunch box to do and proceeded to provide a negative review because that didn’t happen. This lunch box does indeed keep food cold as it claims. Food that you wish to remain cold in the lunch box should go directly from your refrigerator into the lunch box. If you have your settings correct on your refrigerator, the internal temperature of your food should be at 40 degrees or less (to determine the temperature of your food you need to use a food thermometer that you insert into the food, that is the “internal” temperature and the only proper way to determine food temperature. The users review that I addressed used an ambient thermometer). The refrigerated food that you put into this lunch box will remain at the correct temperature of 40 degrees or below for at least 5 hours.

I’m a SAHM so I’m always with them. I struggle staying hydrated and drinking enough liquids through the day, but tumblers with straws help, a lot! Unfortunately the cups I had, the lids didn’t stay on well (and my 3 year old has the habit of grabbing the cups by their lids which was an accident waiting to happen) and it leaked if it tipped over at all. So I got online to see what I could find that would preferably have a screw on lid and wouldn’t leak easily (or at all, preferably).

That’s how I found Simple Modern! I immediately had to try it for myself. It is now my favorite cup to grab and I’m about to buy a second so one can be in the dishwasher while the other is in use (yes it is dishwasher safe, which is another important point for me… I’m too busy to be hand washing cups everyday!) My daughters have even tested how leak proof it is (they tipped it over when it was full with the straw in the cup multiple times and it didn’t leak at all!)

If my opinion on these cups change I’ll change this review, but at the moment it is the perfect cup for an ADHD stay at home mom like me!",positive
161,Kitchen & Dining,Simple Modern Insulated Tumbler Cup with Straw Lid and Flip Lid | Reusable Stainless Steel Water Bottle for Cold Brew Tea Iced Coffee Travel Mug | Classic Collection,$17.99 - $28.99,5,"I was using a double walled Starbucks cup for the last several years as I like to sip on Crystal Light all day while I'm working. It wasn't insulated, sweat a lot, and leaked often. It was time for a new cup.

After searching for an insulated cup, I came across this one. Let me tell you, the hype is REAL!

I read the reviews where people said ice was in it 9 hours later. I didn't really care, but it's become a game to see how long I can make ice last. This weekend, I left Houston for Austin at 8am with my trusty new cup, half full of ice and full of Crystal Light. After getting to Austin and working, I returned to my car at 8am the next morning and I kid you not, there was STILL ICE in the cup (See the 2nd picture)! I honestly didn't care that ice lasted that long, but that is just a testament to how well this cup is built!

It doesn't sweat. You can't tell from the outside if the contents are hot or cold (outside is room temperature). Lots of nice color options. Lid seals very easily unlike my Starbucks one that would go on crooked or seal up so tight, I had to get a rubber can opener mitt to open it (haha it was so annoying). The only time I've gotten any spillage out of this cup was when I overfilled it with my drink and it came out of the straw hole due to pressure (my fault, not the cups).

10/10 buying another one right now. 10/10 would recommend to anyone that wants an insulated cup that just works! 10/10 works as good as (I think better than) my Yeti cup that was twice the price.

I am nobody to you, but I liked this enough to write up a review... for a cup! :D",positive

Delievered in great time too! The cup itself is so modern looking and minimallistic, both the straw lid and sip lid are easy to clean, and the bottle comes with two reusable straws which match the bottle. The straw lid features a cross seal, which makes it so no water comes out, no grime goes in, and it makes it easy to use any straw you'd like. I swapped out the soft plastic/silicone straws that came with my bottle to a set of metal straws I already had at home, and they worked perfectly without messing with the seal. I spent a day in the mall with this in my tote bag with the straw lid and not a single drop spilled. Even better? Keeps cold for HOURS. I put in ice last night (it's averaging 90-95 degrees in the day time here) and very little ice melted by morning, and there was no condensation on the outside of the bottle. Yet to try with hot drinks. The only complaint, or rather warning i might provide is that the 20 oz is pretty big-- it's hard to hold in one hand unless you're holding the very bottom. Otherwise, highly recommend this bottle! Haven't yet dropped it so I'm not sure how much damage it would take.",positive

It's of course not 100% leak proof - it has a straw top lid - but I knock this thing over and only a little bit spills out (which is something I was concerned with at first).

I am SO pleased with this! The tumbler fits easily into cupholders and is comfortable to hold.

The lids are awesome. NOTE: they screw on! This helps it stay leak-proof! If you have the straw in, it won't be leak-proof. However, if you close the lid (either the one with just a straw opening or the one that flips open), your drink doesn't spill. I made sure to test both with a fair amount of water and shook them upside down - no drips or spills! (Naturally, I don't plan to do this in everyday use, but it's good to know!)

As you'd expect from an insulated metal tumbler like this, the insulation is great. I haven't tried it with hot drinks, but I've forgotten to dump out the ice from my coffee more than once and will still find a substantial amount in it the next morning.

I bought a box of six back in April of 2018 and put the box in the pantry. I don't use my Crock Pot very often, but I have lately, using the last of my previous package of liners (Crock Pot brand) a couple of weeks ago.

Today, prepping some spare ribs for the Crock Pot, I opened this ""new"" box and was flabbergasted to find it empty, except for the folded recipe insert. It was one of those head-shaking, eye-blinking moments where you wonder if it's some kind of joke. Now I have to wash the darned thing when the ribs are done.

It's way too late to return it or otherwise resolve it through Amazon, so I'm going to contact Reynolds to see if they'll make it right. My experience with production errors is that they are infrequent and the manufacturer is typically very accommodating.

Update 7/20/2022: Contacted Reynolds and they responded by sending me a generous $5 coupon good towards any of their product line. Many thanks.",positive

I was looking for a solution to send lunch with ice packs in the lunch bag. Thanks to another video I found a solution that is working really well for us. I love Systema products, and so I purchased 2 of the Bento Lunch Boxes because it has a compartment that fits a sandwich and other modular pieces to fit whatever I pack for the kids. The bonus I got from another video about these lunchboxes was that an ice pack fits right in the box beneath the sandwich tray. These ice packs fit perfectly in that space. They are thin. Since our use case is simply to keep lunches cool for a few hours, it’s the perfect solution for us.

210,Kitchen & Dining,Hydro Flask Wide Mouth Bottle with Flex Cap,$24.47 - $109.95,4,"This is my second Hydro Flask. My original is a 32oz that is great for longer times away from home, but I wanted something easy for work & coffee on the go so I decided to get a smaller version. In the family we now have five. Never have I had any of them leak or develop condensation on the outside. These things are amazing & just work! They work even better if you pre-chill or heat the inside prior to adding your drink (use some ice water or heated water from the stove for a little while before loading your beverage of choice). Both of my Hydro Flasks seem lighter than my 18oz Yeti which is nice when full but does raise some concerns about the amount of abuse it may be able to take if dropped though I have yet to drop one.

It loses a star because I have two complaints about Hydro Flasks.

1. The fully painted bottom may be prone to scratching and chipping without a boot but if you put a boot on it sticks to my backpack pockets and cup holders.

2. This is really just personal preference, but I am not a fan of the jumping person logo and really can’t stand it smack in the middle of the bottle. I prefer a clean look. Can’t really cover it up & keep it looking clean. Yeti, still having a logo on the bottle, has better logo placement, out of the way and a bottom that won’t chip (may scratch but won’t remove paint).

Overall the Hydro Flasks are great water bottles and I would recommend them to anyone. They seriously keep my coffee so hot I can only sip it for HOURS if I keep the lid on and it easily holds ice overnight.",positive

Keeps my drink cool as long as I screw the lid on tight.
It’s a big bottle, 64oz. Put my phone (iPhone 11) next to it for reference.

It doesn’t leak. It doesn’t scratch easy. I’ve had mine for about 3 or 4month. And I use it nearly everyday. And I am not the most delicate handler, so as you can see it holds up well. Never dropped it on concrete, but I’ve dropped it plenty on other surfaces.

The quality of these are great! Not thin plastic, but thicker. My kid is able to open independently and I can use rubber muffin cups (I recommend investing if you haven’t for lunches) to break up the larger section if needed.

Soon after I received it, my 21 year old son says, “Mom, do you feel like making waffles?” Couldn’t wait to whip out my new appliance! As pictured, it makes adorable little skull 💀 waffles…. My kid was laughing…..
To use, wipe clean with a damp soapy rag first…and get all the soap off with the clean wet rag. Then plug in and you have to watch the light… lights up when ready, goes off when you put the batter in… then lights up again when done. That’s your only indication. So if you like them darker, you’ll have to let them go a little longer, or vice versa. I wouldn’t suggest walking away. I piled them up in a low setting counter top oven to keep warm because after all, they’re small. Let it cool after use and again wipe clean. I used a Q tip to get in all the grooves before I put it away. It comes with some recipe ideas and they sell a little cookbook, but you can get lots of other recipes online.

242,Kitchen & Dining,"DASH Mini Maker for Individual Waffles, Hash Browns, Keto Chaffles with Easy to Clean",$11.10 - $29.99,5,"I am using this on a small(ish) off grid solar powered system, coming in at a tidy 350 watts it does not stress my power system in any way, it doesn't even make the lights dim (that are on the same circuit). I believe that most people who live off grid or are doing the van/bus life or RV/camper and use batteries to power their stuff should be able to run this with no problems. I bought a similar small mini electric waffle maker from a major dollar store thinking it would be the same, but it was 600 watts, I returned it and will buy another Dash waffle maker because it's only 350 watts.

OK, now to the machine, I bought this to try the chaffle thing, my hubby and I have made some life changes to our health and wanted something that would make healthier foods for us to eat, I had heard of chaffles but wasn't interested until now. Well, I wish I had jumped on the bandwagon when I first heard about them, I have had so much fun making all different kinds of chaffles and waffles.

I mainly do the egg and cheese ones, but have wandered out into some fun territory using healthier flour, my current fav is an organic sprouted whole wheat flour, I also like to add ground flax seed meal. Oh and for flavor, I discovered Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Seasoning Blends ~ Pizza & Pasta Magic Herbal, that makes my chaffles become pizza flavored!

But the biggest news about the Dash mini waffle maker in my house is my hubby is actually using it! This man does not cook, he will tell you himself, he will go hungry before cooking, yet he has been making 2-4 chaffles most everyday, I have had to start buying eggs by the flat since a dozen or 18 packs just don't last very long.

We have been making cheesy egg chaffles and other kinds for bread replacement, I have even bought fast food burgers and brought them home so that I can replace the bread with my homemade bread replacement.

If you are thinking about this, I'd say go for it! It doesn't take up any space, it is lite on power consumption, cooks fast... check YouTube for recipes, tips & tricks, inspiration and the such.

Edited to add: I stepped on a scale over the weekend and discovered to my delight that I had lost a few pounds, probably close to 5 or possibly more. I do intermittent fasting and typically eat one meal a day, the only thing I have changed is not eating bread or bread products anymore, since I eat OMAD it's pretty easy for me to know what I'm consuming, I tend to eat what I want in the amount I want during my eating period, this has helped me to transition away from bread, it's seems to be helping me.

The only thing I can say about this that could be a negative is I noticed that it seems to drain out a tiny bit of oily water from the bottom after use (especially heavy use), I think it's from the steam/water vapor that happens while it's cooking, it manages to get inside the unit and eventually will drain out onto the counter, this isn't from an overflow of product, it's actually coming from the inside. I will often, when I'm done using it, while it's still hot/warm, open it and turn it over onto a paper towel to drain anything that is on the inside. I'm not sure what could be done about this on the manufacturing level, perhaps make it more sealed so that nothing could get inside. It's not a big enough deal to stop me from using it or wanting to buy a second unit. I just discovered there is a tiny drain hole on the bottom of the unit next to a screw hole.",positive
243,Kitchen & Dining,"DASH Mini Maker for Individual Waffles, Hash Browns, Keto Chaffles with Easy to Clean",$11.10 - $29.99,5,"I did full blown Keto for 6 months and while I did lose body fat, I also gained visceral fat when I had ZERO before (and I did clean Keto, too!), so I no longer worry about staying in Ketosis, but I do find that a lower carb lifestyle is optimal for good health and body comp., so I'm always looking to cut carbs where I can. I tend to stay between 50-80g of carbs per day and that is a happy place for me. I bought this cute little waffle maker to help me keep it that way! Pictured is a turkey club I made with chaffles from this little wonder. It's a pretty basic appliance, but it does the job perfectly well for my needs! Also pictured is one of my favorite breakfasts which is a little waffles sandwich I make.

My chaffles recipe is:
1/2C shredded mozarella
4 TBS egg whites (you can use a whole egg but egg whites also work just fine and make it taste less ""eggy"" to me)
2 TBS almond flour
1/2 tsp Psyllium husk powder
1/4 tsp baking powder
+ whatever seasoning I feel like adding in the moment

I heat this guy up about 5 minutes until it's good and hot, then pour about 1/4 C of the batter in (don't over do it!) and cook until brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes. You can tell when it's done without opening the lid if you no longer see steam coming out the sides. I highly recommend letting your chaffles sit for a couple minutes to cool after removing them from the iron as it will help them crisp up a bit more.

Breakfast waffle sandwich recipe:
1/3C sprouted spelt or oat flour
1/3C low fat greek yogurt
3 TBS cage free egg whites
1/8 tsp baking powder
1 tsp vanilla extract
2-3 TBS granulated monk fruit to taste
*Between 2 waffles I put a tablespoon each of lite sour cream and Nature's Hollow sugar free jam

These waffles take a little longer to cook through than chaffles.

I can definitely recommend buying one of these if you eat Keto or low carb and like chaffles to replace bread or if you're like me and make a lot of meals for one!

I sincerely hope this review has been helpful to someone else! And yes, I paid full price for it. Feel free to ask any questions!",positive

245,Kitchen & Dining,"DASH Mini Maker for Individual Waffles, Hash Browns, Keto Chaffles with Easy to Clean",$11.10 - $29.99,5,"There are few items on Amazon for under $10 that are as fantastic as this mini waffle maker. My Wife and I absolutely love it, as does our Little Girl. And what's not to love about it? It makes perfect Eggo-sized waffles, in record time. I do have a few quick suggestions for anyone that's interested in getting it, as well as one terrific hack for using this waffle maker that will be a real game-changer for breakfast and desserts. First off, how to use it....

We use Krusteaz Belgian waffle mix, although just about any waffle or pancake mix will do. We recently got a KPKitchen batter dispenser for pancakes and waffles, which makes it easier to get just the right amount of batter into the waffle iron each and every time. The easiest way to ""grease"" the waffle maker is to simply do a quick spray of Pam on each hot plate before you start making them. If you want waffles that are soft on the outside, spray between each waffle made. If you like a golden brown, slightly crispy/crunchy texture to your waffles, you only need to use the cooking spray once. Stick to using silicone and similar spatulas (avoid using metal utensils) to remove the waffle when it's finished. What's terrific about the size of this waffle maker is that if you have a leftover waffle or two after eating, you can simply stick them in the fridge or freezer for later, and pop them into your toaster (something you can't do with regular-sized waffle makers). Okay, now to the really cool part....

You can make the most amazing waffles with this thing using just canned cinnamon rolls. Without everyone having to wait forever for cinnamon rolls to be baked in the oven. Get a can of the Pillsbury cinnamon rolls with cream cheese icing. Now you can use the icing as-is, but you can make it ""pourable"" by adding a few ingredients. Just whisk/stir the included cream cheese icing with a cup of powdered sugar, three tablespoons of milk, and a teaspoon of vanilla. Once it's smooth, set it aside. When the waffle maker is hot and ready, stick one cinnamon roll directly in the center of it, and close the top firmly. What's going to happen is that it will slowly rise, the top will slowly move up as well. Grab the ""handle"" for the top and firmly press it down a second time. What this does is not only flatten the roll to completely fit the circle of the waffle iron, but ensures that it stays flat and baked through. You can eyeball and it and tell when it's made to your liking, I've found that it takes just slightly longer to make a cinnamon roll waffle than a regular waffle made with batter. Before each waffle is served, drizzle your cream cheese glaze over it. Not only do you have an amazing waffle with a taste like none other, but you don't need any type of pancake or waffle batter on hand. I experimented and also made Pillsbury orange rolls with orange icing, they were fantastic. Just remember, the key to making perfectly round cinnamon roll waffles is to close the lid not once, but a second time as the roll starts to rise in your waffle maker.

There are plenty of things you can buy for ten bucks. But instead of spending ten bucks on fast food, or two iced coffees, invest it something that you'll actually use often. And when you order one of these, you'll definitely use it often. Breakfast waffles. Piping hot cinnamon roll waffles topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert. Fried chicken and waffle sandwiches. Your only limit is your imagination. You can do what I did, read plenty of reviews, and then decide to order it. Or you could just see for yourself how great it works, it's only $10. Go ahead and add it to your shopping cart, you'll be glad you did.",positive

Easy to overfill and cause a mess on the counter. I find that I have to use a butter spray in between each waffle or chaffle I make if I am making more than a couple. The butter spray gathers at the back of the maker and will pour out all over the counter if you tip it. I put a doubled up paper plate under it while cooking to catch the oils or Grease coming out. I saw that they have a new improved version, with a cleaning tool and new non-stick iron on the inside of the waffle maker. Will probably get one of the newer versions and see how it does. If you are just making a couple chaffles, it does the job. Just don't overfill it.",positive

250,Kitchen & Dining,"YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler, Stainless Steel, Vacuum Insulated with MagSlider Lid",$31.00 - $274.99,5,"If you're like me you might be confused by all of the 1 star reviews saying these are counterfeit and not leak proof.

To begin with, you'll see one of the pictures I attached shows right on the sleeve that comes on the cup ""splash resistant to stand up to speed bumps and on the go carrying"". So yes, splash resistant is not equivalent to leak proof. This lid will probably leak if you intend on throwing this into a bag like you would a thermos with a screw on lid.

Second, lots of reviews saying these are counterfeit and made in China. If you Google ""is yeti made in China"" the first thing you'll see from their own website says their ramblers are indeed made in China. The bottom of the cup says designed in Texas, made in China. That doesn't make this counterfeit. In fact, you can see the Yeti symbol is stamped into the steel on both the bottom and side. So if this is counterfeit someone went to an insane length to pass these off as legit. Also, it came with all of the inserts and whatnot from Yeti. Along with a sticker. If this thing is counterfeit it's the most elaborate counterfeit of all time.

Lastly, I saw a lot of reviews saying they didn't get the right lid. Maybe so but I got a mag lid with mine. I wouldn't worry much about that. Probably a packaging mistake for those that happened to.

So in closing, I feel very confident in saying if you want this you can safely ignore the 1 star reviews that mention being counterfeit or not being leak proof.",positive

I contacted Yeti, they apologized, and set a replacement “magslider” via next-day air. No questions asked!! I couldn’t believe it.

I was in the US visiting, and space/weight in my suitcase was limited, so I had to make it count; decided to go with a top brand right away, instead of trying a cheaper brand and risking it not being as good, or not lasting as long. So far I'm really happy!!! The alpine yellow color I chose is pretty and so uplifting. I wasn't sure about the exact model, so I chose the 14oz mug and also this 20oz tumbler. I do enjoy the mug best; I use it on my work desk, and I don't have to worry about knocking it over and making a mess. But this tumbler is awesome for the occasional hot tea around the house, and also for taking tea/coffee on the go (the mug would not fit in the holder on my car). The size is perfection, not too small and not overly large. Nobody ever mentions this detail, but the spot where I place my lips is super important; it cannot be too thin, or stay hot - it just needs to feel right, and this one does it for me. I gave it 4 stars for 'leak proof' because it's not meant to be totally leak proof, but I haven't yet make any messes carrying it around with the lid closed. I also gave it 4 stars for 'easy to carry'; yes, it fits very nicely in my hand, but I would have loved the option of a handle without having to pay extra. Highly recommended!!!",positive

The lid looks like it is on & it did make a slight snapping sound but it is not on straight or tight. It takes a large bit of force to truly get it to snap on straight & tight. If you succeed in accomplishing that, when it’s time to take the top off you will find yourself yanking really hard to do so. If the cup is full & you try to drink it through the slide opening in the lid you “thought” you had secured, you will find the contents will begin to leak out of the side not completely snapped into place. That is when I just take the lid off (quite easily) & drink straight from the cup. If you have successfully snapped the lid down & have been able to pick up the cup & sip out of the lid while moving about or traveling, all is well. Once done drinking the contents & it is time to remove the secured lid be prepared to be over a sink & pull hard! It will eventually come off but any remaining liquid will likely splatter as it breaks free & pops open.
For the price, the blending performance is satisfactory. As for the travel cup concept, it is way too frustrating. You get what you pay for 😏",positive

Fact is, you have to respect a machine for what it is. Just like a car, or a watch or whatever.
You can't force them to be more than they are. If you know how to properly stack ingredients into a smoothie recipe and get the right proportions; you'll be fine. My tip. Blend with always half juice base. Poor into cup. Wash vessel immediately, and don't let fruit bits dry or fester, and you'll own this for a long time, no problems.

I've got the shake bottles but my neighbor gave me one of these and It changed the game. Of course it's not perfect at blending frozen fruit but what do you expect from such an affordable and small appliance. I started blending everything in it! From coffee and creamer to make it foamy to shakes to my nightly banana shake and morning coffee and protein shake. I can even tailor what I blend for myself and put powder from empty capsules for sleep aid. I don't know what I'd to without it. Hers had some wear and tear and at one point I put the lid on one of the stove burners and it melted. I could have still used it just flipped the top but I wanted my own. I searched and this was the best price point and Hamilton is a great brand and bought my own, keeping the old one in case something happens I'll have back up parts but it's fantastic! I rarely write a review but this is a must have especially if you're the only one using it. A big blender would need more cleaning and this doubles as a cup to drink out of. I use it on average 3times a day and bought this one about 5 months ago and it's still holding up well! I'd buy it again. Heck if buy it for my friends. I'm soooooo happy with this purchase. I think it's time to throw out all those nasty shake gathering dust under my sink.

1. The product works. No doubt about it. So that gets us out of the starting blocks. It makes bags that can vacuum and seal food, which is what it claims to do, and I won't deny it one bit.
2. It's basically made like the original ""F**d S*ver"" (let's just call it ""FS"" for the remainder of my review) make-a-bag rolls; one side is clear and the other a textured, grid-like pattern molded into the material.

The ""not so good:""

Here's where the shortcuts are that drop the price. So each purchaser needs to ask him/herself if the benefits of FS bag rolls, the ""perks"" and refinements that those have built in are worth the extra price of the ""real McCoy"" or not. Just want to give information to help with that decision.

1. Material is definitely thinner than the original FS bags. Now having said that, am I going to be ""stressing"" the material, such that this is a major difference? I probably won't, but if you're sealing things that have ""pointy parts"" they could poke through. Homemade dehydrated foods come to mind; they can actually get some sharp parts. Just be aware of this.
2. Unlike the original FS bags, there are no ""hash marks"" on the sides of the roll. Those are handy when making your bag for your food. With these you either have to ""guess"" the size or take it out of the machine (more on THAT in a moment!) and manually measure and cut (optimally straight, which being able to cut INSIDE the machine, using its cutter, helps you do).
3. FS bag material has a very convenient strip on the side for ""Contents"" and ""Date"" (a white, printed-on material that accepts and holds Sharpie writing quite well). You won't find that at all on this product. You have to either write it onto the plastic itself (which tends to rub off) or use separate freezer tape.
4. OK, now the ""big"" (and I actually mean big in this situation) issue. You are definitely buying IN BULK. While you sure do get a lot of bag material, the roll is BIG. TOO big to fit into a FS model FM3941 vacuum sealer (got it at Costco, as I'd bet a lot of other folks did). Yes, it will fit the 11"" width, but the roll itself is too big/thick for the top of the machine to close (which, of course, it has to if it's going to vacuum and seal your bag and food!).
5. So, at the end of the day, I had to measure the size of bag that I wanted with a ruler, mark the line across the material with a pen, manually cut off the bags with scissors (it does cut easily, as a consolation prize), go back to the machine, manually (""free hand"") seal one end, fill it and then vacuum/seal the food. Finally, I stuck a piece of freezer tape onto each bag and labeled them on the tape.

Some may say ""quit 'cher 'bitc*in."" The bags work, right? YES. I admitted that right up front. That makes it an ""okay"" product. But some of the missing refinements in the original keep it from being a ""great"" product, and I wanted to point those out. This product, while certainly serviceable, has a number of shortcomings. It's not ""plug and play."" There are several manual work-arounds that you have to do with it, and I wanted others to be aware of those. Some may say that these drawbacks aren't worth the savings over the original product, so I wanted to share these observations to help others make that judgment for themselves. Others may say that the substantial cost savings are worth it. I leave that to each purchaser to figure what's best for him/her, only hoping that I'm giving you information to help with that decision. While it was a great price, so a ""value"" product, I probably won't purchase again, because the ability to slip a smaller roll into the machine (and close the top, allowing it to actually WORK), be able to measure my bags ""on the fly"" within the machine, seal the bottom of the bag while the roll is in the machine, CUT the bag off while it's in the machine and not have to take another step to put tape onto the bag to label the thing well, those little improvements and ""perks"" are worth something to me. Oh, and I suppose that I could make smaller rolls out of the big one. Yep, sure could and to use these up I probably am going to do that. But that's just ANOTHER step to add to the process that to me just really isn't worth it. Hope this helps.

6/12/21 Addendum - added a couple of pictures of the way I found to mitigate the issue of the roll simply being so large (point #4 in my original review). If you lay the roll down behind the machine on the counter (and I found that it's easier to use if you have the loose end of the roll UNDER the roll (see 2nd picture) rather than OVER it) you can thread, so to speak, the bag material into the hinge slot between the top of the machine (if you have one like mine) and the body of the machine. This way you can use not only the sealing bar but the cutter, as well. Basically as if you had it in the normal groove. It's not perfect, but does make it easier to use until you've used enough of it to fit under the lid in the normal place. Allows a straight cut of the material using the built-in cutter, rather than having to mark the material and cut with scissors. Hope that helps. This definitely costs less than the original bag material, and with use, I haven't found any problems at all with durability in the freezer or loss of vacuum.",fair

1. There are no measuring marks or labeling areas on these. The labeling is more of an inconvenience--the lack of a white background makes reading the label on dark colored items difficult. The lack of measuring marks makes it take longer to measure out bag length when several bags are needed. One or two bags, no big deal, 15 or 20 takes a lot more time than it should.

2. The edges curl a lot after you've cut the bags. It's a bit of a struggle to fill them and keep them flat enough to insert into the machine.

 This review covers the original Alpha Grillers Instant Read Meat Thermometer I purchased in February of 2017--and the new upgraded model you see here (June 2020 anyway). The original thermometer was purchased for $15 based on users reviews on Amazon. You can't find images of it here anymore (although you can see it in my picture comparing the 2017 model to the 2020 model), but it worked well enough and I've been mostly happy with it for the last three years. Recently it went from unreliably turning on, to not turning without removing the AAA battery and futzing with it (no corrosion) for 10 minutes. I was disappointed but $15 for three years of service and left out in the elements, I can't complain too much. I started to browse for a replacement and see that Alpha Grillers' has a ""lifetime warranty"" so I email them pictures of the unit, invoice info, etc. I kid you not: two days later, a replacement arrives from Amazon, and it's the latest version. So none of that ""pay for shipping"" the
dead unit back to them, and we'll see what we can do run around. This alone, should convince you that it's worth buying this thermometer since we all know most of the hardware on Amazon is sourced from a giant factory making and selling units to other resellers. It's probably not a question of the difference in the label--it's a difference in the customer support and there, Alpha Grillers gets 5-stars.

Accuracy and response
Since I have the new unit, I wanted to see how accurate it was so I compared it to my Fluke 52 thermocouple thermometer with a Fluke 80PK-2A immersion probe that I had calibrated with a GE Druck DPI-822. I then filled a narrow mouth Pyrex 1,000ml flask with water from our hot water pot that had been set to 208 F and tried to hold both probe tips near each other in the hot water while trying to take a picture with the hand on a phone. The Fluke 52 and 80PK-2A read out at 184.4 while the Alpha Grillers displayed 184.1. As you know, water cools off fast and it's you don't uniform temperature in the container so the 0.3 degree difference could be the actual temperature difference from the probe positions in the hot water or even the probe shaft differences. Basically, the accuracy is excellent for a $20 meat thermometer.

I also wanted to see how fast the Alpha Grillers unit responds so I filled a second small glass container with ice and water and recorded the display as it was dunked from the ice water back into the hot water (which had now cooled off further). You can watch the video above (it goes from removal from ice bath to hot water, and then back to ice bath and again back to the hot water) but it does respond extremely fast but not necessarily ""instant."" To be fair, ""instant"" is more of a marketing term and open to interpretation anyway. ""Instant"" coffee still takes time to add to water and stir for example.

I'd say it takes about 3.5 seconds to respond to the ice bath to hot water--which is ""instant"" for most of us. For example, the Fluke 80PK-2A is far slower by design because it's a non-tapered, thicker, stainless immersion probe that absorbs a lot of the heat and can take a lot more abuse. The more slender tapered Alpha Grillers tapered tip is designed to pierce meat and also responds far quicker since you don't have to heat up a lot of metal.

As far as the design of the unit, like the previous model, it features a hidden magnet to let you stick it to side of your grill which is a great feature, and the hole lets you hang it from a hook as well if your grill's hooks are large enough. The package also comes with four small hook and loop (Velcro) with adhesive on the back if you want to Velcro it to something.

The new model's rubber buttons are also far easier to press than the previous design's plastic bubble-type. New to this model is very even white LED backlighting. Yes, it looks blue in the official marketing pictures but that's the digital camera color temperature at work--it's actually white.

Hold function
Also new is a hold, and min max function. The function is unlike most typical thermometers which typically cycle from room temperature to max temp and min temp. It's pretty thought out here for a meat thermometer. On the older model which doesn't have the old function, I would stick the thermometer in to the meat on the grill and twist my head over to see the current temp. On meat on the rear of the grill this means getting your head into odd angles and also pretty close to the grill.

With the new model, you insert the probe, press the Hold button to activate the hold (it will display HOLD) and read the temp without all the head craning and heat on your face. Press Hold to release the hold function.

One thing I want to point out: the UI for the hold function might be a little confusing because the hold function first requires that you turn on the hold function before you can use it. This occurs from off state to on. So like most, if you have it folded shut, and open to use, you will have to press the Hold button to turn on the mode. That means the first time you want to use it, you'll have to press it twice: Once to activate the hold mode, and once again to do the first hold. After its in its hold mode, it operates the way you expect it to: Into meat, Hold button to read, and Hold button to release. It doesn't turn off until the thermometer is switched off.

Max Min Function
The same Hold button also activates a max and min temp. This again is unlike the typical user interface of a temperature gauge with room temp / max / min cycle with a single click. To read the maximum temperature, you press and hold the Hold button for 3 seconds and it will display the maximum temperature with MAX in the display. Press again and will see the minimum recorded temperature since the unit was on and MIN in the display. One more press and you exit back into the standard mode. Note: you CANNOT the Max/Min function if it is currently in HOLD. You have to do this from the normal operations. Undocumented feature: Alpha Grillers' documentation say to clear the recorded max/min by turning the unit off (folding the thermometer shut) but if you are in the MAX or MIN mode, you can simply press and hold the Hold button for three seconds and it will reset both recorded max and min memories.

Calibration Mode
Unlike the 2017 mode, the 2020 version features a calibrate feature. On the button that lets you switch from Fahrenheit to Celsius, pressing the button for 5 seconds will let you calibrate the unit. The instructions say to put the probe into a container of ice and water by using the Cal (f/c) button or the Hold button to set the calibration point to 32 degrees F or 0 degrees C. Obviously out of the box accuracy is excellent and for meat grilling do you really need this kind of accuracy or to even calibrate? I dunno. I was more afraid of accidentally pressing the calibrate button and throwing it out of whack so I went ahead and pressed the Cal button for 5 seconds which causes the display to show ""CALL"" (yes there's only one L in calibrate) but rather then letting me accidentally mess up the calibration, the thermometer displayed ""ERR"" and then went back into normal operation. My guess is the unit won't even let you calibrate it unless it's in an ice bath first so my worries about screwing up the calibration are pretty unlikely since you'd have to accidentally dunk it into an ice bath first.

Build quality and battery
Unlike the original Alpha Grillers I had which runs off of AAA, the new unit uses (which comes pre-installed) a CR2032 coin cell. I think this is an improvement as AAA kinda stink. They seem to be the most prone to leaking of all the cylinder cells I use (looking at you Kirkland). Lithium coin-cells, though more expsnsive, are more reliable, far less likely to leak (and ruin your unit) and operate at lower temperatures. The higher voltage also means more power for the the advanced functions in the unit too. I can't say anything about battery life as I haven't had the unit long enough, but I'm sure the LED backlight is the largest consumer of power so if you use it sparingly, it'll probably last quite a while.

Water resistance
Alpha Grillers calls it ""water proof"" and in the documentation, it's stated that you can ""fully submerge"" it in water for a short-time so long as the battery compartment is screwed on tightly. I didn't dunk my unit but I have no reason to doubt the water resistance of it. There are no visible screws anywhere on the unit and there is a gasket in the battery compartment (the gasket could be a little larger though to increase the seal as there are no ridges to mate with the gasket on the actual battery cover, just a flat surface). The only ingress of water would likely come through the gasket flattening over time or through the pivot point of the probe.

The previous 2017 model used a small nub switch that the temperature probe boom depresses to switch off or on. This switch has moved to the inside of the unit which also adds to its water resistance. The probe boom itself is very stiff to open and close which also adds to water resistance. I have no idea how the probe is connected to actual controller board inside or how water resistant that is. The 2020 unit actually switches off at about a 45 degrees angle too which is an improvement over the 2017 model which required closing it firmly to switch off. I would often not switch off if you didn't close it correctly.

I think this is plenty of water and dirt resistance for a meat thermometer unless you're a Navy Seal Griller who needs to scuba up from a sub before grilling on the beach. The main take away is you can probably leave this on your grill during inclement weather without worrying about it being killed. The previous model I had did not have any weather resistance claims and also no gasket in the battery compartment which might be how I killed it.

Improvements
Coming from the previous model, it's a big improvement but it's not without complaints. I think the Hold feature is great, but the button is too close to the temperature scale and backlight button. This means you have to angle your thumb to hit it straight on. You're also going to almost always hit that button from an angle which will put more stress on it over time. The other complaint is the hold button should be activated from power on without having to press it once. I suppose this is done to prevent someone from reading the wrong temperature but I'd rather have it on.

Overall the 2020 model is a big improvement over the 2017 model. Currently it's quite a bit more expensive ($15 for 2017 model vs $20 for 2020 model) but I think the improvements are worth it. And let me again point out the customer service Alpha Grillers provides. My old one let go three and half years later and they stood behind it. For a $15 thermometer. Even if they didn't and they said, ""it's been three years bud,"" I'd buy another one with the improvements, accuracy and speed the new model has over the old one.

And yes, I received this unit free, because my old unit died. Alpha Grillers sent it to me as a warranty replacement not to have it reviewed. It did not ask me to write my review, I did it because a company that stands behind its products deserves recognition and is worthy of my time spent.",positive
