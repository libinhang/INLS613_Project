0,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Happy Birthday Presents (Animated),$50.00,1,"I have sent and received 1000s in amazon gift cards over the years. So it hurts me to write this review but I want to make sure people are aware of how little responsibility Amazon takes to make sure a gift sent through them reaches your loved ones. I sent a 100$ gift card to a friend in April. When she went to use it, she was told the claim code was not valid. She let me know and I called Amazon. I was told that the claim code was used by someone else (they could tell it was a different person)...they sent the same claim code on two different gift cards, so clearly their fault. The rep said she would let the gift card department know. But next morning I get this email from a customer service rep in India..

""
I've researched your Amazon.com Gift Card order and found that it may have been used by ""Susan Pebley"" someone other than the intended recipient. I'm not able to resend the gift card or refund the order.

To receive a refund, please contact the bank that issued the credit card used to purchase the gift card and dispute the charge. The bank will send paperwork for you to sign to verify any unauthorized charge. Your bank will then pass the appropriate paperwork on to us.

I hope you understand my limitations and help us to serve you better.We hope to see you again soon.

We'd appreciate your feedback. Please use the links below to tell us about your experience today.""

One they dont want to fix something that should be easy to fix....""just reissue a gift card"", they want me to spend more time trying to get back what should be there in the first place . The credit card company cant do anything unless you find out about it in their 90 day limit. That doesnt usually happen as most gift card recepients dont use it right away. They might not even feel close enough to the giver to let them know it didnt work...just imagine how many gifts dont reach the recipient.

very disappointed by Amazon. I will be looking for a different more reliable company to send my gifts with.

Felt this was important to bring to people's attention with the coming holiday season. Please don't waste your money sending an Amazon gift card. Just send your loved ones cash instead.",negative
1,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Happy Birthday Presents (Animated),$50.00,5,"How can you not give an amazon card 5 stars? This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day. This is simply amazing.

I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a 16 year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house. All your friends will think you are cool as sh*t because, after all, you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school.

The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won't be a able to resist. She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly, nervous approach and you know its on. You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says ""of course"".

Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life. So what do you do? you hit Amazon.com and order a new wardrobe, throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order. You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM! Order confirmed, it'll be at mommy and daddy's door day after tomorrow.

You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi. He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date. You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him. You say ""i think i have a couple"" even though you have never touched one in your life.

You head home, you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right. You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date.

Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area. How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing? AMAZON!!! you log on as fast as you can, nervous to type in the search bar. After a minute of anxiety you do it, you type it in the search bar and the results are endless. You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors, shapes and colors. You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy's phone. They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon.

You sit and ponder what to do in front of the $3500 iMac that you got handed to you for your 15 and half birthday. You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well. You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from. You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke. You place the order: $7.99 for a ten pack plus $4.63 for shipping. The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don't care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you. Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night.

Your date is now only hours away. ""This will work out great"" you think. You'll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school, change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi's house to pick her up for your night of adventure.

After school you rush home, you arrive, send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight. Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn't want you to look like one of those ""poor kids"" that is still running the iPhone 7. You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name. He replies ""no mail today sir"". What the hell? you ordered those condoms two days ago, everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE...??

You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon. You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment. ""Processing"" is the only word you see. Ok, Ok, Ok. Its going to be fine. you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn't going to be like that anyway. You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have... or don't have.

You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you. You are using the iPhone X to navigate. You arrive. She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot. Maybe all that research was right about Lexi's. You justify it by telling yourself ""its hot out, she just doesn't like to be hot"". Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A/C being full blast in the brand new vehicle. You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab.

Lexi starts to laugh and asks, ""we aren't really going bowling are we??"" in her typical dirty Lexi voice. She sees that your are frozen. You don't know what to say or do in this moment. She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about. ""its only about 10 minutes from here"" she says. you drive and make nervous small talk on the way. Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi's house. You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi's directions than SIri's anyway. Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street? You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn't help much.

You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about, its beginning to get dark. She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would. She asks if you have protection. You tell her no ""i can't stand those"" an excuse you've heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying. Soon it happens and is over in approximately 26 seconds. You head back to Lexi's house to drop her off. You can't believe what just happened. You head home, call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with 35 gallons of pure American Diesel fuel. you fill it up and go home.

Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi. She hasn't talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over. So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting. You call her back, she gives you the news. She's pregnant.

While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room. You say ""Freak off!"" like he expected from your disrespectful a*s. he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor. Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago. ""How ironic"" you think and kick the box in anger.

9 months later, you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child. You weren't even going to come since you haven't ever had to take any responsibility for your actions. Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though. The kid is born, you don't give a flying freak and you leave.

Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support. You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay $10k/month to Lexi. That isn't shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it.

Now, many years later, you are still living in mommy and daddy's mansion. They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi. This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want.

Everyday you curse that online retailer. You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms. You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn't have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend.

This is why Amazon Gift cards get 5 stars from me",positive
2,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Happy Birthday Presents (Animated),$50.00,1,"I think I am just wasting time writing this, but this must have happened to someone else. Something is definitely not right here.
I have had so many good experiences with eGift cards until this one. I bought 4 email gift cards in 1 order and they were all sent correctly to 4 recipients' emails. Two of them were redeemed within a day and I got notified via email as such. After almost 3 months, I was browsing my other orders and saw the other two were redeemed by an email address that I didn't recognize. I sent an inquiry to Amazon.com. After 10 emails, 1 phone call and 1 chat 4 weeks later, amazon.com asked me to file a claim through my credit card company that paid for the gift cards.
My initial inquiries via emails were quite frustrating as each email was responded by different support person who obviously didn't read previous emails. After two days of these emails, I called amazon.com. The support person was helpful and told me name of the amazon customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Since I didn't know the amazon customer who redeemed the gift cards and I never resent those gift cards to an email address different from the intended recipients, it was clear that the two gift cards were fraudulently sent and redeemed. They were going to investigate this case, so I thought. After 2 weeks of not hearing back from amazon.com, I followed up with the most recent email from 2 weeks prior. They came back with they will contact me when they finish their investigation. I didn't hear back from them for another 2 weeks, so I sent another followup email. This time, they came back with you need to go through your credit card company to file a claim. It was clear I wasted weeks corresponding with amazon.com thinking they are doing something, but it is clear now all they are doing is dragging this out to frustrate their customers. Just because I feel I need to do the right thing, I filed a claim with my credit card company today and I am posting this review.
So, why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were resent to another email? Why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were redeemed? Did I say that neither me nor my original recipients know the customer name who redeemed those two gift cards nor the email in which the gift cards were resent? How did those two gift cards get resent to an email address without my credit card number being re-entered, or was my credit card number re-entered? Amazon.com knows the customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Did they ask that customer how she got the gift cards? None of that seems to matter as they just came back after all the emails, phone call and chat, you need to file a claim via your credit card company.",negative
3,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Happy Birthday Presents (Animated),$50.00,5,"Many times you want to thank your friends for assisting you with exceptional tasks. It can be difficult trying to find the best gift to offer as a way of saying “thank you for being there”. The Amazon gift card is probably one of the best gifts because just about everyone can find something they can use. In fact, when my friend received the gift card that is exactly what they said. They were most appreciative to receive an Amazon gift card.

It was easy to gift, I sent it via email, and it was ready to use ASAP. This type of gift is also good when people do not want to give out their physical address.",positive

My only advice is MAKE SURE YOU TYPE IN EMAIL ADRESS CORRECTLY. However, as I just mentioned in my experience if you catch it immediately or within a very short time span Amazon seems to work w/you on this. So far I believe we've purchased these for 3 seperate ppl and this has given them the freedom to buy what they want instead of us sending a gift they don't want. And, while ppl say getting a personalized gift shows that it comes from the heart which I agree with...there's is nothing worse than spending a long time shopping for someone and in turn they don't like their gift(and your shopping from the heart) and by a long time I mean hours and so with buying a gift card it takes away the anxiety of buying a gift they'll love and it removes the disappointment on their end as well. Oh and you can buy a somewhat personalized card...like Happy Father's Day, Happy Birthday, and so on OR...you can add a personalized photo which we've done and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!! So if you have any reservations I hope this cleared it up oh and one more thing...I believe you can make them up to $1- $500 (the amount may be higher not really sure on this).",positive

I sent a 100$ gift card to a friend in April. When she went to use it, she was told the claim code was not valid. She let me know and I called Amazon. I was told that the claim code was used by someone else (they could tell it was a different person)...they sent the same claim code on two different gift cards, so clearly their fault.

I've researched your Amazon.com Gift Card order and found that it may have been used by ""Susan Pebley"" someone other than the intended recipient. I'm not able to resend the gift card or refund the order.

To receive a refund, please contact the bank that issued the credit card used to purchase the gift card and dispute the charge. The bank will send paperwork for you to sign to verify any unauthorized charge. Your bank will then pass the appropriate paperwork on to us.

I hope you understand my limitations and help us to serve you better.We hope to see you again soon.

One they dont want to fix something that should be easy to fix....""just reissue a gift card"", they want me to spend more time trying to get back what should be there in the first place . The credit card company cant do anything unless you find out about it in their 90 day limit. That doesnt usually happen as most gift card recepients dont use it right away. They might not even feel close enough to the giver to let them know it didnt work...just imagine how many gifts dont reach the recipient.

very disappointed by Amazon. I will be looking for a different more reliable company to send my gifts with.

21,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Amazon Logo,$50.00,5,"How can you not give an amazon card 5 stars? This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day. This is simply amazing.

I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a 16 year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house. All your friends will think you are cool as sh*t because, after all, you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school.

The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won't be a able to resist. She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly, nervous approach and you know its on. You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says ""of course"".

Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life. So what do you do? you hit Amazon.com and order a new wardrobe, throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order. You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM! Order confirmed, it'll be at mommy and daddy's door day after tomorrow.

You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi. He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date. You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him. You say ""i think i have a couple"" even though you have never touched one in your life.

You head home, you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right. You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date.

Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area. How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing? AMAZON!!! you log on as fast as you can, nervous to type in the search bar. After a minute of anxiety you do it, you type it in the search bar and the results are endless. You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors, shapes and colors. You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy's phone. They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon.

You sit and ponder what to do in front of the $3500 iMac that you got handed to you for your 15 and half birthday. You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well. You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from. You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke. You place the order: $7.99 for a ten pack plus $4.63 for shipping. The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don't care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you. Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night.

Your date is now only hours away. ""This will work out great"" you think. You'll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school, change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi's house to pick her up for your night of adventure.

After school you rush home, you arrive, send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight. Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn't want you to look like one of those ""poor kids"" that is still running the iPhone 7. You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name. He replies ""no mail today sir"". What the hell? you ordered those condoms two days ago, everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE...??

You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon. You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment. ""Processing"" is the only word you see. Ok, Ok, Ok. Its going to be fine. you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn't going to be like that anyway. You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have... or don't have.

You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you. You are using the iPhone X to navigate. You arrive. She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot. Maybe all that research was right about Lexi's. You justify it by telling yourself ""its hot out, she just doesn't like to be hot"". Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A/C being full blast in the brand new vehicle. You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab.

Lexi starts to laugh and asks, ""we aren't really going bowling are we??"" in her typical dirty Lexi voice. She sees that your are frozen. You don't know what to say or do in this moment. She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about. ""its only about 10 minutes from here"" she says. you drive and make nervous small talk on the way. Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi's house. You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi's directions than SIri's anyway. Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street? You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn't help much.

You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about, its beginning to get dark. She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would. She asks if you have protection. You tell her no ""i can't stand those"" an excuse you've heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying. Soon it happens and is over in approximately 26 seconds. You head back to Lexi's house to drop her off. You can't believe what just happened. You head home, call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with 35 gallons of pure American Diesel fuel. you fill it up and go home.

Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi. She hasn't talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over. So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting. You call her back, she gives you the news. She's pregnant.

While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room. You say ""Freak off!"" like he expected from your disrespectful a*s. he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor. Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago. ""How ironic"" you think and kick the box in anger.

9 months later, you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child. You weren't even going to come since you haven't ever had to take any responsibility for your actions. Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though. The kid is born, you don't give a flying freak and you leave.

Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support. You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay $10k/month to Lexi. That isn't shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it.

Now, many years later, you are still living in mommy and daddy's mansion. They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi. This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want.

Everyday you curse that online retailer. You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms. You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn't have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend.

This is why Amazon Gift cards get 5 stars from me",positive
22,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Amazon Logo,$50.00,1,"I think I am just wasting time writing this, but this must have happened to someone else. Something is definitely not right here.
I have had so many good experiences with eGift cards until this one. I bought 4 email gift cards in 1 order and they were all sent correctly to 4 recipients' emails. Two of them were redeemed within a day and I got notified via email as such. After almost 3 months, I was browsing my other orders and saw the other two were redeemed by an email address that I didn't recognize. I sent an inquiry to Amazon.com. After 10 emails, 1 phone call and 1 chat 4 weeks later, amazon.com asked me to file a claim through my credit card company that paid for the gift cards.
My initial inquiries via emails were quite frustrating as each email was responded by different support person who obviously didn't read previous emails. After two days of these emails, I called amazon.com. The support person was helpful and told me name of the amazon customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Since I didn't know the amazon customer who redeemed the gift cards and I never resent those gift cards to an email address different from the intended recipients, it was clear that the two gift cards were fraudulently sent and redeemed. They were going to investigate this case, so I thought. After 2 weeks of not hearing back from amazon.com, I followed up with the most recent email from 2 weeks prior. They came back with they will contact me when they finish their investigation. I didn't hear back from them for another 2 weeks, so I sent another followup email. This time, they came back with you need to go through your credit card company to file a claim. It was clear I wasted weeks corresponding with amazon.com thinking they are doing something, but it is clear now all they are doing is dragging this out to frustrate their customers. Just because I feel I need to do the right thing, I filed a claim with my credit card company today and I am posting this review.
So, why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were resent to another email? Why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were redeemed? Did I say that neither me nor my original recipients know the customer name who redeemed those two gift cards nor the email in which the gift cards were resent? How did those two gift cards get resent to an email address without my credit card number being re-entered, or was my credit card number re-entered? Amazon.com knows the customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Did they ask that customer how she got the gift cards? None of that seems to matter as they just came back after all the emails, phone call and chat, you need to file a claim via your credit card company.",negative

However, as I just mentioned in my experience if you catch it immediately or within a very short time span Amazon seems to work w/you on this. So far I believe we've purchased these for 3 seperate ppl and this has given them the freedom to buy what they want instead of us sending a gift they don't want. And, while ppl say getting a personalized gift shows that it comes from the heart which I agree with...there's is nothing worse than spending a long time shopping for someone and in turn they don't like their gift(and your shopping from the heart) and by a long time I mean hours and so with buying a gift card it takes away the anxiety of buying a gift they'll love and it removes the disappointment on their end as well. Oh and you can buy a somewhat personalized card...like Happy Father's Day, Happy Birthday, and so on OR...you can add a personalized photo which we've done and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!! So if you have any reservations I hope this cleared it up oh and one more thing...I believe you can make them up to $1- $500 (the amount may be higher not really sure on this).",positive

Oh and you can buy a somewhat personalized card...like Happy Father's Day, Happy Birthday, and so on OR...you can add a personalized photo which we've done and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!! So if you have any reservations I hope this cleared it up oh and one more thing...I believe you can make them up to $1- $500 (the amount may be higher not really sure on this).",positive

41,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Birthday Reveal (Animated),$50.00,5,"How can you not give an amazon card 5 stars? This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day. This is simply amazing.

I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a 16 year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house. All your friends will think you are cool as sh*t because, after all, you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school.

The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won't be a able to resist. She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly, nervous approach and you know its on. You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says ""of course"".

Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life. So what do you do? you hit Amazon.com and order a new wardrobe, throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order. You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM! Order confirmed, it'll be at mommy and daddy's door day after tomorrow.

You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi. He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date. You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him. You say ""i think i have a couple"" even though you have never touched one in your life.

You head home, you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right. You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date.

Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area. How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing? AMAZON!!! you log on as fast as you can, nervous to type in the search bar. After a minute of anxiety you do it, you type it in the search bar and the results are endless. You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors, shapes and colors. You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy's phone. They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon.

You sit and ponder what to do in front of the $3500 iMac that you got handed to you for your 15 and half birthday. You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well. You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from. You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke. You place the order: $7.99 for a ten pack plus $4.63 for shipping. The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don't care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you. Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night.

Your date is now only hours away. ""This will work out great"" you think. You'll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school, change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi's house to pick her up for your night of adventure.

After school you rush home, you arrive, send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight. Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn't want you to look like one of those ""poor kids"" that is still running the iPhone 7. You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name. He replies ""no mail today sir"". What the hell? you ordered those condoms two days ago, everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE...??

You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon. You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment. ""Processing"" is the only word you see. Ok, Ok, Ok. Its going to be fine. you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn't going to be like that anyway. You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have... or don't have.

You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you. You are using the iPhone X to navigate. You arrive. She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot. Maybe all that research was right about Lexi's. You justify it by telling yourself ""its hot out, she just doesn't like to be hot"". Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A/C being full blast in the brand new vehicle. You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab.

Lexi starts to laugh and asks, ""we aren't really going bowling are we??"" in her typical dirty Lexi voice. She sees that your are frozen. You don't know what to say or do in this moment. She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about. ""its only about 10 minutes from here"" she says. you drive and make nervous small talk on the way. Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi's house. You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi's directions than SIri's anyway. Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street? You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn't help much.

You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about, its beginning to get dark. She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would. She asks if you have protection. You tell her no ""i can't stand those"" an excuse you've heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying. Soon it happens and is over in approximately 26 seconds. You head back to Lexi's house to drop her off. You can't believe what just happened. You head home, call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with 35 gallons of pure American Diesel fuel. you fill it up and go home.

Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi. She hasn't talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over. So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting. You call her back, she gives you the news. She's pregnant.

While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room. You say ""Freak off!"" like he expected from your disrespectful a*s. he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor. Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago. ""How ironic"" you think and kick the box in anger.

9 months later, you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child. You weren't even going to come since you haven't ever had to take any responsibility for your actions. Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though. The kid is born, you don't give a flying freak and you leave.

Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support. You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay $10k/month to Lexi. That isn't shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it.

Now, many years later, you are still living in mommy and daddy's mansion. They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi. This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want.

Everyday you curse that online retailer. You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms. You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn't have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend.

This is why Amazon Gift cards get 5 stars from me",positive
42,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Birthday Reveal (Animated),$50.00,1,"I think I am just wasting time writing this, but this must have happened to someone else. Something is definitely not right here.
I have had so many good experiences with eGift cards until this one. I bought 4 email gift cards in 1 order and they were all sent correctly to 4 recipients' emails. Two of them were redeemed within a day and I got notified via email as such. After almost 3 months, I was browsing my other orders and saw the other two were redeemed by an email address that I didn't recognize. I sent an inquiry to Amazon.com. After 10 emails, 1 phone call and 1 chat 4 weeks later, amazon.com asked me to file a claim through my credit card company that paid for the gift cards.
My initial inquiries via emails were quite frustrating as each email was responded by different support person who obviously didn't read previous emails. After two days of these emails, I called amazon.com. The support person was helpful and told me name of the amazon customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Since I didn't know the amazon customer who redeemed the gift cards and I never resent those gift cards to an email address different from the intended recipients, it was clear that the two gift cards were fraudulently sent and redeemed. They were going to investigate this case, so I thought. After 2 weeks of not hearing back from amazon.com, I followed up with the most recent email from 2 weeks prior. They came back with they will contact me when they finish their investigation. I didn't hear back from them for another 2 weeks, so I sent another followup email. This time, they came back with you need to go through your credit card company to file a claim. It was clear I wasted weeks corresponding with amazon.com thinking they are doing something, but it is clear now all they are doing is dragging this out to frustrate their customers. Just because I feel I need to do the right thing, I filed a claim with my credit card company today and I am posting this review.
So, why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were resent to another email? Why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were redeemed? Did I say that neither me nor my original recipients know the customer name who redeemed those two gift cards nor the email in which the gift cards were resent? How did those two gift cards get resent to an email address without my credit card number being re-entered, or was my credit card number re-entered? Amazon.com knows the customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Did they ask that customer how she got the gift cards? None of that seems to matter as they just came back after all the emails, phone call and chat, you need to file a claim via your credit card company.",negative

You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon. You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment. ""Processing"" is the only word you see. Ok, Ok, Ok. Its going to be fine. you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn't going to be like that anyway. You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have... or don't have.

You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you. You are using the iPhone X to navigate. You arrive. She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot. Maybe all that research was right about Lexi's. You justify it by telling yourself ""its hot out, she just doesn't like to be hot"". Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A/C being full blast in the brand new vehicle. You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab.

Lexi starts to laugh and asks, ""we aren't really going bowling are we??"" in her typical dirty Lexi voice. She sees that your are frozen. You don't know what to say or do in this moment. She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about. ""its only about 10 minutes from here"" she says. you drive and make nervous small talk on the way. Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi's house. You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi's directions than SIri's anyway. Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street? You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn't help much.

You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about, its beginning to get dark. She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would. She asks if you have protection. You tell her no ""i can't stand those"" an excuse you've heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying. Soon it happens and is over in approximately 26 seconds. You head back to Lexi's house to drop her off. You can't believe what just happened. You head home, call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with 35 gallons of pure American Diesel fuel. you fill it up and go home.

Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi. She hasn't talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over. So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting. You call her back, she gives you the news. She's pregnant.

While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room. You say ""Freak off!"" like he expected from your disrespectful a*s. he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor. Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago. ""How ironic"" you think and kick the box in anger.

9 months later, you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child. You weren't even going to come since you haven't ever had to take any responsibility for your actions. Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though. The kid is born, you don't give a flying freak and you leave.

Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support. You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay $10k/month to Lexi. That isn't shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it.

Now, many years later, you are still living in mommy and daddy's mansion. They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi. This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want.

Everyday you curse that online retailer. You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms. You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn't have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend.

This is why Amazon Gift cards get 5 stars from me",positive
72,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Happy Birthday Presents Design,$50.00,1,"I think I am just wasting time writing this, but this must have happened to someone else. Something is definitely not right here.
I have had so many good experiences with eGift cards until this one. I bought 4 email gift cards in 1 order and they were all sent correctly to 4 recipients' emails. Two of them were redeemed within a day and I got notified via email as such. After almost 3 months, I was browsing my other orders and saw the other two were redeemed by an email address that I didn't recognize. I sent an inquiry to Amazon.com. After 10 emails, 1 phone call and 1 chat 4 weeks later, amazon.com asked me to file a claim through my credit card company that paid for the gift cards.
My initial inquiries via emails were quite frustrating as each email was responded by different support person who obviously didn't read previous emails. After two days of these emails, I called amazon.com. The support person was helpful and told me name of the amazon customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Since I didn't know the amazon customer who redeemed the gift cards and I never resent those gift cards to an email address different from the intended recipients, it was clear that the two gift cards were fraudulently sent and redeemed. They were going to investigate this case, so I thought. After 2 weeks of not hearing back from amazon.com, I followed up with the most recent email from 2 weeks prior. They came back with they will contact me when they finish their investigation. I didn't hear back from them for another 2 weeks, so I sent another followup email. This time, they came back with you need to go through your credit card company to file a claim. It was clear I wasted weeks corresponding with amazon.com thinking they are doing something, but it is clear now all they are doing is dragging this out to frustrate their customers. Just because I feel I need to do the right thing, I filed a claim with my credit card company today and I am posting this review.
So, why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were resent to another email? Why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were redeemed? Did I say that neither me nor my original recipients know the customer name who redeemed those two gift cards nor the email in which the gift cards were resent? How did those two gift cards get resent to an email address without my credit card number being re-entered, or was my credit card number re-entered? Amazon.com knows the customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Did they ask that customer how she got the gift cards? None of that seems to matter as they just came back after all the emails, phone call and chat, you need to file a claim via your credit card company.",negative

74,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Happy Birthday Presents Design,$50.00,5,"These gift cards are easy to use make purchasing them and giving a gift so easy even a cave man can do it!! My only advice is MAKE SURE YOU TYPE IN EMAIL ADRESS CORRECTLY. However, as I just mentioned in my experience if you catch it immediately or within a very short time span Amazon seems to work w/you on this. So far I believe we've purchased these for 3 seperate ppl and this has given them the freedom to buy what they want instead of us sending a gift they don't want. And, while ppl say getting a personalized gift shows that it comes from the heart which I agree with...there's is nothing worse than spending a long time shopping for someone and in turn they don't like their gift(and your shopping from the heart) and by a long time I mean hours and so with buying a gift card it takes away the anxiety of buying a gift they'll love and it removes the disappointment on their end as well. Oh and you can buy a somewhat personalized card...like Happy Father's Day, Happy Birthday, and so on OR...you can add a personalized photo which we've done and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!! So if you have any reservations I hope this cleared it up oh and one more thing...I believe you can make them up to $1- $500 (the amount may be higher not really sure on this).",positive

Something told me that there was something too easy about this gift carding usage with them so I checked my account. My folks thought I was sending them an e-card and that it automatically went into their Amazon account. I found that they had never opened the cards to follow the button that states ""Apply to your account"". Either they thought they were saving me money or they thought it was just automatic. We were on the phone and went through the process. Now, they have $350 of e-cards they never loaded. Now, they enjoyed their Prime Day! And we are all 3 laughing at ourselves.

130,Gift Cards,$100 Visa Gift Card (plus $5.95 Purchase Fee),$105.95,5,"I got this  $100 Visa Gift Card  because although I have actual credit/debit cards that I use in person at brick & mortar stores and other businesses and online on big-name websites like Amazon, Instacart, Shipt, Target and the like, I am not comfortable giving out my actual card info when shopping on less(er) known and/or potentially risky websites.

So when circumstances necessitate doing business with them (as it did recently, while looking for a replacement battery for my 2007 HP laptop I dug out from a closet after not using it since 2009-2010 [and particularly since switching to Apple/Mac in 2012-2013] in order to play some retro offline Windows games I've not played in years that I missed playing................unfortunately, neither Amazon nor any other big-name stores or websites [like Best Buy, NewEgg, etc.] seem to carry a compatible battery and I had to go with an unknown/lesser known website) I prefer to use non-reloadable prepaid ""gift"" cards, so that in the worst case scenario, if the site is ""fly-by-night"" scam business and/or the website gets hacked, they won't have access to my actual credit/debit card info or bank data, and the maximum amount of money I'd potentially lose would limited to whatever the denomination (or remaining balance) on the prepaid card. Granted, depending on the card (AFAIK there cards come in denominations of $25, $50, $100 and $200 cards) it could still be a lot of money to lose, but at least one's entire credit line and private info wouldn't be at risk as it would be using a conventional credit/debit card.

Personally, after several years of using prepaid Visa, Mastercard and other credit cards, like this one, I have to say I think prepaid ""gift"" cards are a GREAT option, when shopping online, especially when making purchases at certain websites/kinds of websites.

However, previously, Amazon did NOT offer these prepaid Visa, Mastercard and other credit-card ""gift"" cards and rather, only offered gift cards for specific stores, restaurants or other businesses. This necessitated having to physically go to a brick & mortar store and buy a prepaid ""gift"" credit card in person anytime I needed a Visa/Mastercard to use online -- and since, due to disabilities, I'm unable to drive, getting these prepaid cards were a huge hassle!

Which is why I am so glad that Amazon has started offering these prepaid Visa/Mastercard gift cards for sale through their site. I don't know if its because of COVID-19, and the lockdowns, or what, but making these prepaid cards available through Amazon, has made it a LOT easier for those of us who are mostly homebound, to get and use these cards as needed.

As mentioned, these cards come in denominations of $25, $50, $100 and $200, and are NOT reloadable (meaning once the balance on the card is used up, you need to buy another card and cannot add more money to that same card). Also they cannot be used to get cash at ATMs or POS (point of sale) purchases. But they can be made for most other purchases where Visa and Mastercard are accepted, which these days, is the majority of places, at least in the US. I have never used these in other countries, not even Canada, so I cannot speak to their functionality abroad. That being said, I recently tried to use one of these cards online on GOG (Good Old Games) and I had difficulty completing the transaction because apparently the site's based in Europe, so the card was declined. But then I just made the payment using the card as a ""guest"" via Paypal (I no longer trust Paypal enough to maintain an actual account with them anymore) and the transaction went through, immediately.

Other than that, I've had no problems with these cards. The card arrives, open the package and register the card number on their listed website, with your basic info (name, address, phone number, email) which AFAIK is NOT necessary for in-person purchases, but IS (or may be) necessary for online purchases -- and then use the card just like you would any other Visa or Mastercard until you've exhausted the amount on your card. Then, throw it away (or cut it up first if you've registered it with your personal info) and get another one the next time you need it!

Easy-peasy!

So it hurts me to write this review but I want to make sure people are aware of how little responsibility Amazon takes to make sure a gift sent through them reaches your loved ones. I sent a 100$ gift card to a friend in April. When she went to use it, she was told the claim code was not valid. She let me know and I called Amazon. I was told that the claim code was used by someone else (they could tell it was a different person)...they sent the same claim code on two different gift cards, so clearly their fault. The rep said she would let the gift card department know. But next morning I get this email from a customer service rep in India..

I've researched your Amazon.com Gift Card order and found that it may have been used by ""Susan Pebley"" someone other than the intended recipient. I'm not able to resend the gift card or refund the order.

To receive a refund, please contact the bank that issued the credit card used to purchase the gift card and dispute the charge. The bank will send paperwork for you to sign to verify any unauthorized charge. Your bank will then pass the appropriate paperwork on to us.

I hope you understand my limitations and help us to serve you better.We hope to see you again soon.

We'd appreciate your feedback. Please use the links below to tell us about your experience today.""

One they dont want to fix something that should be easy to fix....""just reissue a gift card"", they want me to spend more time trying to get back what should be there in the first place . The credit card company cant do anything unless you find out about it in their 90 day limit. That doesnt usually happen as most gift card recepients dont use it right away. They might not even feel close enough to the giver to let them know it didnt work...just imagine how many gifts dont reach the recipient.

very disappointed by Amazon. I will be looking for a different more reliable company to send my gifts with.

Felt this was important to bring to people's attention with the coming holiday season. Please don't waste your money sending an Amazon gift card. Just send your loved ones cash instead.",negative
141,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Birthday Cupcakes,$50.00,5,"How can you not give an amazon card 5 stars? This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day. This is simply amazing.

I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a 16 year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house. All your friends will think you are cool as sh*t because, after all, you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school.

The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won't be a able to resist. She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly, nervous approach and you know its on. You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says ""of course"".

Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life. So what do you do? you hit Amazon.com and order a new wardrobe, throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order. You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM! Order confirmed, it'll be at mommy and daddy's door day after tomorrow.

You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi. He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date. You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him. You say ""i think i have a couple"" even though you have never touched one in your life.

You head home, you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right. You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date.

Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area. How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing? AMAZON!!! you log on as fast as you can, nervous to type in the search bar. After a minute of anxiety you do it, you type it in the search bar and the results are endless. You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors, shapes and colors. You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy's phone. They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon.

You sit and ponder what to do in front of the $3500 iMac that you got handed to you for your 15 and half birthday. You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well. You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from. You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke. You place the order: $7.99 for a ten pack plus $4.63 for shipping. The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don't care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you. Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night.

Your date is now only hours away. ""This will work out great"" you think. You'll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school, change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi's house to pick her up for your night of adventure.

After school you rush home, you arrive, send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight. Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn't want you to look like one of those ""poor kids"" that is still running the iPhone 7. You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name. He replies ""no mail today sir"". What the hell? you ordered those condoms two days ago, everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE...??

You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon. You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment. ""Processing"" is the only word you see. Ok, Ok, Ok. Its going to be fine. you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn't going to be like that anyway. You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have... or don't have.

You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you. You are using the iPhone X to navigate. You arrive. She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot. Maybe all that research was right about Lexi's. You justify it by telling yourself ""its hot out, she just doesn't like to be hot"". Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A/C being full blast in the brand new vehicle. You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab.

Lexi starts to laugh and asks, ""we aren't really going bowling are we??"" in her typical dirty Lexi voice. She sees that your are frozen. You don't know what to say or do in this moment. She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about. ""its only about 10 minutes from here"" she says. you drive and make nervous small talk on the way. Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi's house. You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi's directions than SIri's anyway. Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street? You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn't help much.

You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about, its beginning to get dark. She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would. She asks if you have protection. You tell her no ""i can't stand those"" an excuse you've heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying. Soon it happens and is over in approximately 26 seconds. You head back to Lexi's house to drop her off. You can't believe what just happened. You head home, call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with 35 gallons of pure American Diesel fuel. you fill it up and go home.

Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi. She hasn't talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over. So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting. You call her back, she gives you the news. She's pregnant.

While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room. You say ""Freak off!"" like he expected from your disrespectful a*s. he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor. Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago. ""How ironic"" you think and kick the box in anger.

9 months later, you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child. You weren't even going to come since you haven't ever had to take any responsibility for your actions. Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though. The kid is born, you don't give a flying freak and you leave.

Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support. You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay $10k/month to Lexi. That isn't shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it.

Now, many years later, you are still living in mommy and daddy's mansion. They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi. This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want.

Everyday you curse that online retailer. You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms. You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn't have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend.

142,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Birthday Cupcakes,$50.00,1,"I think I am just wasting time writing this, but this must have happened to someone else. Something is definitely not right here.
I have had so many good experiences with eGift cards until this one. I bought 4 email gift cards in 1 order and they were all sent correctly to 4 recipients' emails. Two of them were redeemed within a day and I got notified via email as such. After almost 3 months, I was browsing my other orders and saw the other two were redeemed by an email address that I didn't recognize. I sent an inquiry to Amazon.com. After 10 emails, 1 phone call and 1 chat 4 weeks later, amazon.com asked me to file a claim through my credit card company that paid for the gift cards.
My initial inquiries via emails were quite frustrating as each email was responded by different support person who obviously didn't read previous emails. After two days of these emails, I called amazon.com. The support person was helpful and told me name of the amazon customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Since I didn't know the amazon customer who redeemed the gift cards and I never resent those gift cards to an email address different from the intended recipients, it was clear that the two gift cards were fraudulently sent and redeemed. They were going to investigate this case, so I thought. After 2 weeks of not hearing back from amazon.com, I followed up with the most recent email from 2 weeks prior. They came back with they will contact me when they finish their investigation. I didn't hear back from them for another 2 weeks, so I sent another followup email. This time, they came back with you need to go through your credit card company to file a claim. It was clear I wasted weeks corresponding with amazon.com thinking they are doing something, but it is clear now all they are doing is dragging this out to frustrate their customers. Just because I feel I need to do the right thing, I filed a claim with my credit card company today and I am posting this review.
So, why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were resent to another email? Why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were redeemed? Did I say that neither me nor my original recipients know the customer name who redeemed those two gift cards nor the email in which the gift cards were resent? How did those two gift cards get resent to an email address without my credit card number being re-entered, or was my credit card number re-entered? Amazon.com knows the customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Did they ask that customer how she got the gift cards? None of that seems to matter as they just came back after all the emails, phone call and chat, you need to file a claim via your credit card company.",negative

My only advice is MAKE SURE YOU TYPE IN EMAIL ADRESS CORRECTLY. However, as I just mentioned in my experience if you catch it immediately or within a very short time span Amazon seems to work w/you on this. So far I believe we've purchased these for 3 seperate ppl and this has given them the freedom to buy what they want instead of us sending a gift they don't want. And, while ppl say getting a personalized gift shows that it comes from the heart which I agree with...there's is nothing worse than spending a long time shopping for someone and in turn they don't like their gift(and your shopping from the heart) and by a long time I mean hours and so with buying a gift card it takes away the anxiety of buying a gift they'll love and it removes the disappointment on their end as well. Oh and you can buy a somewhat personalized card...like Happy Father's Day, Happy Birthday, and so on OR...you can add a personalized photo which we've done and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!! So if you have any reservations I hope this cleared it up oh and one more thing...I believe you can make them up to $1- $500 (the amount may be higher not really sure on this).",positive

Something told me that there was something too easy about this gift carding usage with them so I checked my account. My folks thought I was sending them an e-card and that it automatically went into their Amazon account. I found that they had never opened the cards to follow the button that states ""Apply to your account"". Either they thought they were saving me money or they thought it was just automatic. We were on the phone and went through the process. Now, they have $350 of e-cards they never loaded. Now, they enjoyed their Prime Day! And we are all 3 laughing at ourselves.

So if you have any reservations I hope this cleared it up oh and one more thing...I believe you can make them up to $1- $500 (the amount may be higher not really sure on this).",positive

So it hurts me to write this review but I want to make sure people are aware of how little responsibility Amazon takes to make sure a gift sent through them reaches your loved ones. I sent a 100$ gift card to a friend in April. When she went to use it, she was told the claim code was not valid. She let me know and I called Amazon. I was told that the claim code was used by someone else (they could tell it was a different person)...they sent the same claim code on two different gift cards, so clearly their fault. The rep said she would let the gift card department know. But next morning I get this email from a customer service rep in India..

""
I've researched your Amazon.com Gift Card order and found that it may have been used by ""Susan Pebley"" someone other than the intended recipient. I'm not able to resend the gift card or refund the order.

To receive a refund, please contact the bank that issued the credit card used to purchase the gift card and dispute the charge. The bank will send paperwork for you to sign to verify any unauthorized charge. Your bank will then pass the appropriate paperwork on to us.

I hope you understand my limitations and help us to serve you better.We hope to see you again soon.

We'd appreciate your feedback. Please use the links below to tell us about your experience today.""

One they dont want to fix something that should be easy to fix....""just reissue a gift card"", they want me to spend more time trying to get back what should be there in the first place . The credit card company cant do anything unless you find out about it in their 90 day limit. That doesnt usually happen as most gift card recepients dont use it right away. They might not even feel close enough to the giver to let them know it didnt work...just imagine how many gifts dont reach the recipient.

very disappointed by Amazon. I will be looking for a different more reliable company to send my gifts with.

171,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - We Appreciate You- Hex pattern,$50.00,5,"How can you not give an amazon card 5 stars? This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day. This is simply amazing.

I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a 16 year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house. All your friends will think you are cool as sh*t because, after all, you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school.

The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won't be a able to resist. She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly, nervous approach and you know its on. You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says ""of course"".

Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life. So what do you do? you hit Amazon.com and order a new wardrobe, throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order. You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM! Order confirmed, it'll be at mommy and daddy's door day after tomorrow.

You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi. He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date. You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him. You say ""i think i have a couple"" even though you have never touched one in your life.

You head home, you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right. You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date.

Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area. How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing? AMAZON!!! you log on as fast as you can, nervous to type in the search bar. After a minute of anxiety you do it, you type it in the search bar and the results are endless. You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors, shapes and colors. You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy's phone. They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon.

You sit and ponder what to do in front of the $3500 iMac that you got handed to you for your 15 and half birthday. You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well. You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from. You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke. You place the order: $7.99 for a ten pack plus $4.63 for shipping. The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don't care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you. Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night.

Your date is now only hours away. ""This will work out great"" you think. You'll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school, change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi's house to pick her up for your night of adventure.

After school you rush home, you arrive, send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight. Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn't want you to look like one of those ""poor kids"" that is still running the iPhone 7. You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name. He replies ""no mail today sir"". What the hell? you ordered those condoms two days ago, everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE...??

You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon. You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment. ""Processing"" is the only word you see. Ok, Ok, Ok. Its going to be fine. you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn't going to be like that anyway. You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have... or don't have.

You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you. You are using the iPhone X to navigate. You arrive. She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot. Maybe all that research was right about Lexi's. You justify it by telling yourself ""its hot out, she just doesn't like to be hot"". Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A/C being full blast in the brand new vehicle. You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab.

Lexi starts to laugh and asks, ""we aren't really going bowling are we??"" in her typical dirty Lexi voice. She sees that your are frozen. You don't know what to say or do in this moment. She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about. ""its only about 10 minutes from here"" she says. you drive and make nervous small talk on the way. Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi's house. You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi's directions than SIri's anyway. Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street? You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn't help much.

You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about, its beginning to get dark. She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would. She asks if you have protection. You tell her no ""i can't stand those"" an excuse you've heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying. Soon it happens and is over in approximately 26 seconds. You head back to Lexi's house to drop her off. You can't believe what just happened. You head home, call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with 35 gallons of pure American Diesel fuel. you fill it up and go home.

Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi. She hasn't talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over. So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting. You call her back, she gives you the news. She's pregnant.

While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room. You say ""Freak off!"" like he expected from your disrespectful a*s. he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor. Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago. ""How ironic"" you think and kick the box in anger.

9 months later, you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child. You weren't even going to come since you haven't ever had to take any responsibility for your actions. Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though. The kid is born, you don't give a flying freak and you leave.

Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support. You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay $10k/month to Lexi. That isn't shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it.

Now, many years later, you are still living in mommy and daddy's mansion. They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi. This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want.

Everyday you curse that online retailer. You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms. You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn't have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend.

This is why Amazon Gift cards get 5 stars from me",positive
172,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - We Appreciate You- Hex pattern,$50.00,1,"I think I am just wasting time writing this, but this must have happened to someone else. Something is definitely not right here.
I have had so many good experiences with eGift cards until this one. I bought 4 email gift cards in 1 order and they were all sent correctly to 4 recipients' emails. Two of them were redeemed within a day and I got notified via email as such. After almost 3 months, I was browsing my other orders and saw the other two were redeemed by an email address that I didn't recognize. I sent an inquiry to Amazon.com. After 10 emails, 1 phone call and 1 chat 4 weeks later, amazon.com asked me to file a claim through my credit card company that paid for the gift cards.
My initial inquiries via emails were quite frustrating as each email was responded by different support person who obviously didn't read previous emails. After two days of these emails, I called amazon.com. The support person was helpful and told me name of the amazon customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Since I didn't know the amazon customer who redeemed the gift cards and I never resent those gift cards to an email address different from the intended recipients, it was clear that the two gift cards were fraudulently sent and redeemed. They were going to investigate this case, so I thought. After 2 weeks of not hearing back from amazon.com, I followed up with the most recent email from 2 weeks prior. They came back with they will contact me when they finish their investigation. I didn't hear back from them for another 2 weeks, so I sent another followup email. This time, they came back with you need to go through your credit card company to file a claim. It was clear I wasted weeks corresponding with amazon.com thinking they are doing something, but it is clear now all they are doing is dragging this out to frustrate their customers. Just because I feel I need to do the right thing, I filed a claim with my credit card company today and I am posting this review.
So, why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were resent to another email? Why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were redeemed? Did I say that neither me nor my original recipients know the customer name who redeemed those two gift cards nor the email in which the gift cards were resent? How did those two gift cards get resent to an email address without my credit card number being re-entered, or was my credit card number re-entered? Amazon.com knows the customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Did they ask that customer how she got the gift cards? None of that seems to matter as they just came back after all the emails, phone call and chat, you need to file a claim via your credit card company.",negative

182,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Conga Dogs (Animated),$50.00,1,"I think I am just wasting time writing this, but this must have happened to someone else. Something is definitely not right here.
I have had so many good experiences with eGift cards until this one. I bought 4 email gift cards in 1 order and they were all sent correctly to 4 recipients' emails. Two of them were redeemed within a day and I got notified via email as such. After almost 3 months, I was browsing my other orders and saw the other two were redeemed by an email address that I didn't recognize. I sent an inquiry to Amazon.com. After 10 emails, 1 phone call and 1 chat 4 weeks later, amazon.com asked me to file a claim through my credit card company that paid for the gift cards.
My initial inquiries via emails were quite frustrating as each email was responded by different support person who obviously didn't read previous emails. After two days of these emails, I called amazon.com. The support person was helpful and told me name of the amazon customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Since I didn't know the amazon customer who redeemed the gift cards and I never resent those gift cards to an email address different from the intended recipients, it was clear that the two gift cards were fraudulently sent and redeemed. They were going to investigate this case, so I thought. After 2 weeks of not hearing back from amazon.com, I followed up with the most recent email from 2 weeks prior. They came back with they will contact me when they finish their investigation. I didn't hear back from them for another 2 weeks, so I sent another followup email. This time, they came back with you need to go through your credit card company to file a claim. It was clear I wasted weeks corresponding with amazon.com thinking they are doing something, but it is clear now all they are doing is dragging this out to frustrate their customers. Just because I feel I need to do the right thing, I filed a claim with my credit card company today and I am posting this review.
So, why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were resent to another email? Why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were redeemed? Did I say that neither me nor my original recipients know the customer name who redeemed those two gift cards nor the email in which the gift cards were resent? How did those two gift cards get resent to an email address without my credit card number being re-entered, or was my credit card number re-entered? Amazon.com knows the customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Did they ask that customer how she got the gift cards? None of that seems to matter as they just came back after all the emails, phone call and chat, you need to file a claim via your credit card company.",negative

It can be difficult trying to find the best gift to offer as a way of saying “thank you for being there”. The Amazon gift card is probably one of the best gifts because just about everyone can find something they can use. In fact, when my friend received the gift card that is exactly what they said. They were most appreciative to receive an Amazon gift card.

184,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Conga Dogs (Animated),$50.00,5,"These gift cards are easy to use make purchasing them and giving a gift so easy even a cave man can do it!! My only advice is MAKE SURE YOU TYPE IN EMAIL ADRESS CORRECTLY. However, as I just mentioned in my experience if you catch it immediately or within a very short time span Amazon seems to work w/you on this. So far I believe we've purchased these for 3 seperate ppl and this has given them the freedom to buy what they want instead of us sending a gift they don't want. And, while ppl say getting a personalized gift shows that it comes from the heart which I agree with...there's is nothing worse than spending a long time shopping for someone and in turn they don't like their gift(and your shopping from the heart) and by a long time I mean hours and so with buying a gift card it takes away the anxiety of buying a gift they'll love and it removes the disappointment on their end as well. Oh and you can buy a somewhat personalized card...like Happy Father's Day, Happy Birthday, and so on OR...you can add a personalized photo which we've done and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!! So if you have any reservations I hope this cleared it up oh and one more thing...I believe you can make them up to $1- $500 (the amount may be higher not really sure on this).",positive

So it hurts me to write this review but I want to make sure people are aware of how little responsibility Amazon takes to make sure a gift sent through them reaches your loved ones. I sent a 100$ gift card to a friend in April. When she went to use it, she was told the claim code was not valid. She let me know and I called Amazon. I was told that the claim code was used by someone else (they could tell it was a different person)...they sent the same claim code on two different gift cards, so clearly their fault. The rep said she would let the gift card department know. But next morning I get this email from a customer service rep in India..

""
I've researched your Amazon.com Gift Card order and found that it may have been used by ""Susan Pebley"" someone other than the intended recipient. I'm not able to resend the gift card or refund the order.

To receive a refund, please contact the bank that issued the credit card used to purchase the gift card and dispute the charge. The bank will send paperwork for you to sign to verify any unauthorized charge. Your bank will then pass the appropriate paperwork on to us.

I hope you understand my limitations and help us to serve you better.We hope to see you again soon.

We'd appreciate your feedback. Please use the links below to tell us about your experience today.""

One they dont want to fix something that should be easy to fix....""just reissue a gift card"", they want me to spend more time trying to get back what should be there in the first place . The credit card company cant do anything unless you find out about it in their 90 day limit. That doesnt usually happen as most gift card recepients dont use it right away. They might not even feel close enough to the giver to let them know it didnt work...just imagine how many gifts dont reach the recipient.

very disappointed by Amazon. I will be looking for a different more reliable company to send my gifts with.

Felt this was important to bring to people's attention with the coming holiday season. Please don't waste your money sending an Amazon gift card. Just send your loved ones cash instead.",negative
201,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Star,$50.00,5,"How can you not give an amazon card 5 stars? This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day. This is simply amazing.

I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a 16 year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house. All your friends will think you are cool as sh*t because, after all, you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school.

The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won't be a able to resist. She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly, nervous approach and you know its on. You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says ""of course"".

Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life. So what do you do? you hit Amazon.com and order a new wardrobe, throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order. You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM! Order confirmed, it'll be at mommy and daddy's door day after tomorrow.

You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi. He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date. You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him. You say ""i think i have a couple"" even though you have never touched one in your life.

You head home, you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right. You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date.

Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area. How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing? AMAZON!!! you log on as fast as you can, nervous to type in the search bar. After a minute of anxiety you do it, you type it in the search bar and the results are endless. You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors, shapes and colors. You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy's phone. They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon.

You sit and ponder what to do in front of the $3500 iMac that you got handed to you for your 15 and half birthday. You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well. You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from. You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke. You place the order: $7.99 for a ten pack plus $4.63 for shipping. The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don't care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you. Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night.

Your date is now only hours away. ""This will work out great"" you think. You'll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school, change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi's house to pick her up for your night of adventure.

After school you rush home, you arrive, send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight. Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn't want you to look like one of those ""poor kids"" that is still running the iPhone 7. You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name. He replies ""no mail today sir"". What the hell? you ordered those condoms two days ago, everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE...??

You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon. You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment. ""Processing"" is the only word you see. Ok, Ok, Ok. Its going to be fine. you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn't going to be like that anyway. You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have... or don't have.

You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you. You are using the iPhone X to navigate. You arrive. She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot. Maybe all that research was right about Lexi's. You justify it by telling yourself ""its hot out, she just doesn't like to be hot"". Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A/C being full blast in the brand new vehicle. You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab.

Lexi starts to laugh and asks, ""we aren't really going bowling are we??"" in her typical dirty Lexi voice. She sees that your are frozen. You don't know what to say or do in this moment. She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about. ""its only about 10 minutes from here"" she says. you drive and make nervous small talk on the way. Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi's house. You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi's directions than SIri's anyway. Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street? You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn't help much.

You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about, its beginning to get dark. She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would. She asks if you have protection. You tell her no ""i can't stand those"" an excuse you've heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying. Soon it happens and is over in approximately 26 seconds. You head back to Lexi's house to drop her off. You can't believe what just happened. You head home, call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with 35 gallons of pure American Diesel fuel. you fill it up and go home.

Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi. She hasn't talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over. So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting. You call her back, she gives you the news. She's pregnant.

While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room. You say ""Freak off!"" like he expected from your disrespectful a*s. he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor. Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago. ""How ironic"" you think and kick the box in anger.

9 months later, you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child. You weren't even going to come since you haven't ever had to take any responsibility for your actions. Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though. The kid is born, you don't give a flying freak and you leave.

Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support. You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay $10k/month to Lexi. That isn't shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it.

Now, many years later, you are still living in mommy and daddy's mansion. They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi. This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want.

Everyday you curse that online retailer. You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms. You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn't have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend.

This is why Amazon Gift cards get 5 stars from me",positive

I was told that the claim code was used by someone else (they could tell it was a different person)...they sent the same claim code on two different gift cards, so clearly their fault.

I've researched your Amazon.com Gift Card order and found that it may have been used by ""Susan Pebley"" someone other than the intended recipient. I'm not able to resend the gift card or refund the order.

To receive a refund, please contact the bank that issued the credit card used to purchase the gift card and dispute the charge. The bank will send paperwork for you to sign to verify any unauthorized charge. Your bank will then pass the appropriate paperwork on to us.

I hope you understand my limitations and help us to serve you better.We hope to see you again soon.

One they dont want to fix something that should be easy to fix....""just reissue a gift card"", they want me to spend more time trying to get back what should be there in the first place . The credit card company cant do anything unless you find out about it in their 90 day limit. That doesnt usually happen as most gift card recepients dont use it right away. They might not even feel close enough to the giver to let them know it didnt work...just imagine how many gifts dont reach the recipient.

very disappointed by Amazon. I will be looking for a different more reliable company to send my gifts with.

231,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Congrats (Fireworks),$50.00,5,"How can you not give an amazon card 5 stars? This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day. This is simply amazing.

I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a 16 year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house. All your friends will think you are cool as sh*t because, after all, you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school.

The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won't be a able to resist. She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly, nervous approach and you know its on. You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says ""of course"".

Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life. So what do you do? you hit Amazon.com and order a new wardrobe, throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order. You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM! Order confirmed, it'll be at mommy and daddy's door day after tomorrow.

You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi. He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date. You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him. You say ""i think i have a couple"" even though you have never touched one in your life.

You head home, you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right. You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date.

Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area. How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing? AMAZON!!! you log on as fast as you can, nervous to type in the search bar. After a minute of anxiety you do it, you type it in the search bar and the results are endless. You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors, shapes and colors. You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy's phone. They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon.

You sit and ponder what to do in front of the $3500 iMac that you got handed to you for your 15 and half birthday. You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well. You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from. You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke. You place the order: $7.99 for a ten pack plus $4.63 for shipping. The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don't care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you. Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night.

Your date is now only hours away. ""This will work out great"" you think. You'll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school, change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi's house to pick her up for your night of adventure.

After school you rush home, you arrive, send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight. Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn't want you to look like one of those ""poor kids"" that is still running the iPhone 7. You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name. He replies ""no mail today sir"". What the hell? you ordered those condoms two days ago, everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE...??

You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon. You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment. ""Processing"" is the only word you see. Ok, Ok, Ok. Its going to be fine. you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn't going to be like that anyway. You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have... or don't have.

You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you. You are using the iPhone X to navigate. You arrive. She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot. Maybe all that research was right about Lexi's. You justify it by telling yourself ""its hot out, she just doesn't like to be hot"". Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A/C being full blast in the brand new vehicle. You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab.

Lexi starts to laugh and asks, ""we aren't really going bowling are we??"" in her typical dirty Lexi voice. She sees that your are frozen. You don't know what to say or do in this moment. She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about. ""its only about 10 minutes from here"" she says. you drive and make nervous small talk on the way. Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi's house. You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi's directions than SIri's anyway. Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street? You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn't help much.

You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about, its beginning to get dark. She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would. She asks if you have protection. You tell her no ""i can't stand those"" an excuse you've heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying. Soon it happens and is over in approximately 26 seconds. You head back to Lexi's house to drop her off. You can't believe what just happened. You head home, call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with 35 gallons of pure American Diesel fuel. you fill it up and go home.

Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi. She hasn't talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over. So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting. You call her back, she gives you the news. She's pregnant.

While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room. You say ""Freak off!"" like he expected from your disrespectful a*s. he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor. Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago. ""How ironic"" you think and kick the box in anger.

9 months later, you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child. You weren't even going to come since you haven't ever had to take any responsibility for your actions. Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though. The kid is born, you don't give a flying freak and you leave.

Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support. You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay $10k/month to Lexi. That isn't shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it.

Now, many years later, you are still living in mommy and daddy's mansion. They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi. This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want.

Everyday you curse that online retailer. You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms. You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn't have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend.

232,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - Congrats (Fireworks),$50.00,1,"I think I am just wasting time writing this, but this must have happened to someone else. Something is definitely not right here.
I have had so many good experiences with eGift cards until this one. I bought 4 email gift cards in 1 order and they were all sent correctly to 4 recipients' emails. Two of them were redeemed within a day and I got notified via email as such. After almost 3 months, I was browsing my other orders and saw the other two were redeemed by an email address that I didn't recognize. I sent an inquiry to Amazon.com. After 10 emails, 1 phone call and 1 chat 4 weeks later, amazon.com asked me to file a claim through my credit card company that paid for the gift cards.
My initial inquiries via emails were quite frustrating as each email was responded by different support person who obviously didn't read previous emails. After two days of these emails, I called amazon.com. The support person was helpful and told me name of the amazon customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Since I didn't know the amazon customer who redeemed the gift cards and I never resent those gift cards to an email address different from the intended recipients, it was clear that the two gift cards were fraudulently sent and redeemed. They were going to investigate this case, so I thought. After 2 weeks of not hearing back from amazon.com, I followed up with the most recent email from 2 weeks prior. They came back with they will contact me when they finish their investigation. I didn't hear back from them for another 2 weeks, so I sent another followup email. This time, they came back with you need to go through your credit card company to file a claim. It was clear I wasted weeks corresponding with amazon.com thinking they are doing something, but it is clear now all they are doing is dragging this out to frustrate their customers. Just because I feel I need to do the right thing, I filed a claim with my credit card company today and I am posting this review.
So, why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were resent to another email? Why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were redeemed? Did I say that neither me nor my original recipients know the customer name who redeemed those two gift cards nor the email in which the gift cards were resent? How did those two gift cards get resent to an email address without my credit card number being re-entered, or was my credit card number re-entered? Amazon.com knows the customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Did they ask that customer how she got the gift cards? None of that seems to matter as they just came back after all the emails, phone call and chat, you need to file a claim via your credit card company.",negative

However, as I just mentioned in my experience if you catch it immediately or within a very short time span Amazon seems to work w/you on this. So far I believe we've purchased these for 3 seperate ppl and this has given them the freedom to buy what they want instead of us sending a gift they don't want. And, while ppl say getting a personalized gift shows that it comes from the heart which I agree with...there's is nothing worse than spending a long time shopping for someone and in turn they don't like their gift(and your shopping from the heart) and by a long time I mean hours and so with buying a gift card it takes away the anxiety of buying a gift they'll love and it removes the disappointment on their end as well. Oh and you can buy a somewhat personalized card...like Happy Father's Day, Happy Birthday, and so on OR...you can add a personalized photo which we've done and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!

I was a little nervous to purchase a do-it-yourself kind of gift certificate like this, but was pleased to find that it printed on my computer with absolutely no problems at all. Folding it seemed like it might be a challenge, but was surprisingly easy. But I'm very good at folding paper along the printed lines, so perhaps that helped. After I printed it, I gave it to someone as a gift. It fit perfectly inside of the card I bought, so that was an added bonus! I'm pretty sure the code will work just fine if/when he redeems it, but I don't know for sure if he redeemed it yet. As far as gift certificates are concerned, this is definitely a functional gift certificate, and well worth your consideration. If you are looking to buy a gift certificate for yourself or someone else, I don't think you'll regret buying this gift certificate. It's a swell gift certificate and should fulfill any gift certificate need. What an exciting day, to have purchased such an awesome gift certificate! Yay!",positive

280,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - You're Amazing! Rainbow Design,$50.00,1,"I have sent and received 1000s in amazon gift cards over the years. So it hurts me to write this review but I want to make sure people are aware of how little responsibility Amazon takes to make sure a gift sent through them reaches your loved ones. I sent a 100$ gift card to a friend in April. When she went to use it, she was told the claim code was not valid. She let me know and I called Amazon. I was told that the claim code was used by someone else (they could tell it was a different person)...they sent the same claim code on two different gift cards, so clearly their fault. The rep said she would let the gift card department know. But next morning I get this email from a customer service rep in India..

""
I've researched your Amazon.com Gift Card order and found that it may have been used by ""Susan Pebley"" someone other than the intended recipient. I'm not able to resend the gift card or refund the order.

To receive a refund, please contact the bank that issued the credit card used to purchase the gift card and dispute the charge. The bank will send paperwork for you to sign to verify any unauthorized charge. Your bank will then pass the appropriate paperwork on to us.

I hope you understand my limitations and help us to serve you better.We hope to see you again soon.

We'd appreciate your feedback. Please use the links below to tell us about your experience today.""

One they dont want to fix something that should be easy to fix....""just reissue a gift card"", they want me to spend more time trying to get back what should be there in the first place . The credit card company cant do anything unless you find out about it in their 90 day limit. That doesnt usually happen as most gift card recepients dont use it right away. They might not even feel close enough to the giver to let them know it didnt work...just imagine how many gifts dont reach the recipient.

very disappointed by Amazon. I will be looking for a different more reliable company to send my gifts with.

Felt this was important to bring to people's attention with the coming holiday season. Please don't waste your money sending an Amazon gift card. Just send your loved ones cash instead.",negative
281,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - You're Amazing! Rainbow Design,$50.00,5,"How can you not give an amazon card 5 stars? This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day. This is simply amazing.

I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a 16 year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house. All your friends will think you are cool as sh*t because, after all, you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school.

The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won't be a able to resist. She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly, nervous approach and you know its on. You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says ""of course"".

Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life. So what do you do? you hit Amazon.com and order a new wardrobe, throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order. You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM! Order confirmed, it'll be at mommy and daddy's door day after tomorrow.

You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi. He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date. You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him. You say ""i think i have a couple"" even though you have never touched one in your life.

You head home, you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right. You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date.

Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area. How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing? AMAZON!!! you log on as fast as you can, nervous to type in the search bar. After a minute of anxiety you do it, you type it in the search bar and the results are endless. You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors, shapes and colors. You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy's phone. They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon.

You sit and ponder what to do in front of the $3500 iMac that you got handed to you for your 15 and half birthday. You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well. You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from. You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke. You place the order: $7.99 for a ten pack plus $4.63 for shipping. The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don't care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you. Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night.

Your date is now only hours away. ""This will work out great"" you think. You'll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school, change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi's house to pick her up for your night of adventure.

After school you rush home, you arrive, send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight. Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn't want you to look like one of those ""poor kids"" that is still running the iPhone 7. You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name. He replies ""no mail today sir"". What the hell? you ordered those condoms two days ago, everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE...??

You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon. You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment. ""Processing"" is the only word you see. Ok, Ok, Ok. Its going to be fine. you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn't going to be like that anyway. You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have... or don't have.

You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you. You are using the iPhone X to navigate. You arrive. She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot. Maybe all that research was right about Lexi's. You justify it by telling yourself ""its hot out, she just doesn't like to be hot"". Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A/C being full blast in the brand new vehicle. You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab.

Lexi starts to laugh and asks, ""we aren't really going bowling are we??"" in her typical dirty Lexi voice. She sees that your are frozen. You don't know what to say or do in this moment. She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about. ""its only about 10 minutes from here"" she says. you drive and make nervous small talk on the way. Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi's house. You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi's directions than SIri's anyway. Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street? You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn't help much.

You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about, its beginning to get dark. She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would. She asks if you have protection. You tell her no ""i can't stand those"" an excuse you've heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying. Soon it happens and is over in approximately 26 seconds. You head back to Lexi's house to drop her off. You can't believe what just happened. You head home, call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with 35 gallons of pure American Diesel fuel. you fill it up and go home.

Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi. She hasn't talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over. So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting. You call her back, she gives you the news. She's pregnant.

While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room. You say ""Freak off!"" like he expected from your disrespectful a*s. he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor. Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago. ""How ironic"" you think and kick the box in anger.

9 months later, you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child. You weren't even going to come since you haven't ever had to take any responsibility for your actions. Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though. The kid is born, you don't give a flying freak and you leave.

Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support. You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay $10k/month to Lexi. That isn't shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it.

Now, many years later, you are still living in mommy and daddy's mansion. They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi. This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want.

Everyday you curse that online retailer. You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms. You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn't have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend.

This is why Amazon Gift cards get 5 stars from me",positive
282,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - You're Amazing! Rainbow Design,$50.00,1,"I think I am just wasting time writing this, but this must have happened to someone else. Something is definitely not right here.
I have had so many good experiences with eGift cards until this one. I bought 4 email gift cards in 1 order and they were all sent correctly to 4 recipients' emails. Two of them were redeemed within a day and I got notified via email as such. After almost 3 months, I was browsing my other orders and saw the other two were redeemed by an email address that I didn't recognize. I sent an inquiry to Amazon.com. After 10 emails, 1 phone call and 1 chat 4 weeks later, amazon.com asked me to file a claim through my credit card company that paid for the gift cards.
My initial inquiries via emails were quite frustrating as each email was responded by different support person who obviously didn't read previous emails. After two days of these emails, I called amazon.com. The support person was helpful and told me name of the amazon customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Since I didn't know the amazon customer who redeemed the gift cards and I never resent those gift cards to an email address different from the intended recipients, it was clear that the two gift cards were fraudulently sent and redeemed. They were going to investigate this case, so I thought. After 2 weeks of not hearing back from amazon.com, I followed up with the most recent email from 2 weeks prior. They came back with they will contact me when they finish their investigation. I didn't hear back from them for another 2 weeks, so I sent another followup email. This time, they came back with you need to go through your credit card company to file a claim. It was clear I wasted weeks corresponding with amazon.com thinking they are doing something, but it is clear now all they are doing is dragging this out to frustrate their customers. Just because I feel I need to do the right thing, I filed a claim with my credit card company today and I am posting this review.
So, why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were resent to another email? Why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were redeemed? Did I say that neither me nor my original recipients know the customer name who redeemed those two gift cards nor the email in which the gift cards were resent? How did those two gift cards get resent to an email address without my credit card number being re-entered, or was my credit card number re-entered? Amazon.com knows the customer who redeemed the two gift cards. Did they ask that customer how she got the gift cards? None of that seems to matter as they just came back after all the emails, phone call and chat, you need to file a claim via your credit card company.",negative

It can be difficult trying to find the best gift to offer as a way of saying “thank you for being there”.

284,Gift Cards,Amazon eGift Card - You're Amazing! Rainbow Design,$50.00,5,"These gift cards are easy to use make purchasing them and giving a gift so easy even a cave man can do it!! My only advice is MAKE SURE YOU TYPE IN EMAIL ADRESS CORRECTLY. However, as I just mentioned in my experience if you catch it immediately or within a very short time span Amazon seems to work w/you on this. So far I believe we've purchased these for 3 seperate ppl and this has given them the freedom to buy what they want instead of us sending a gift they don't want. And, while ppl say getting a personalized gift shows that it comes from the heart which I agree with...there's is nothing worse than spending a long time shopping for someone and in turn they don't like their gift(and your shopping from the heart) and by a long time I mean hours and so with buying a gift card it takes away the anxiety of buying a gift they'll love and it removes the disappointment on their end as well. Oh and you can buy a somewhat personalized card...like Happy Father's Day, Happy Birthday, and so on OR...you can add a personalized photo which we've done and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!! So if you have any reservations I hope this cleared it up oh and one more thing...I believe you can make them up to $1- $500 (the amount may be higher not really sure on this).",positive
