0,Grocery & Gourmet Food,CELSIUS Essential Energy Drink 12 FL Oz,$8.63 - $86.98,4,"The variety pack came with a bizarre combination of flavors and mix of carbonated and non-carbonated drinks. I didn’t even know that Celsius made non-carbonated until I received this! The non carbonated drinks were:
- 2 Peach mango green tea - tasty, but wish it was carbonated
- 2 are Raspberry Acai green tea - OK, but I preferred the peach

The carbonated drinks contained an odd variety, some excellent, and others just awful;
- 1 sparkling orange (v good)
- 1 white peach (excellent)
- 2 grape (OK)
- 2 cola (just awful)
- 2 watermelon (surprisingly good)

They were not packed in any particular order in the case. It’s almost as if someone randomly threw cans into the case. I generally like Celsius brand (although I wish they used a better quality sweetener than sucralose). However, I wouldn’t get anymore of the cola if they were giving it away free! I’m also not a fan of the non carbonated ones.",positive
1,Grocery & Gourmet Food,CELSIUS Essential Energy Drink 12 FL Oz,$8.63 - $86.98,5,"I've tried to kick my soda habit on and off for years. One day, my cousin came over after working out and brought this with her. She asked me if I wanted to try it but I told her I don't like seltzer water or flavored seltzer water but she insisted and I fell in love. It took 2.5 seconds to get used to the taste, which is nothing like Coca Cola, but after that it was great. I did get a little bit of a buzz, and I personally don't drink it on an empty stomach because it does make me jittery. I haven't tried any other flavors but all my friends are obsessed with all the different flavors and the grocery store by me regularly sells out of this flavor.",positive
2,Grocery & Gourmet Food,CELSIUS Essential Energy Drink 12 FL Oz,$8.63 - $86.98,5,"grape tastes very good. I've gotten the variety packs at Costco and just didn't like three of the four flavors so it seemed wasteful. I decided to try this when I got a good price on it and I'm glad I did.

3,Grocery & Gourmet Food,CELSIUS Essential Energy Drink 12 FL Oz,$8.63 - $86.98,4,"Alright, so I went with the variety pack because it was cheapest. When I looked at the picture, I recognized most of the flavors and did not think much of it until the item arrived.
NOT pictured is the watermelon flavor which is probably the worst flavor Celsius (I bought it was from the gas station and never again). There is also a Coke flavor which I have never seen before until the package arrived. Therefore, if you have not had these flavors before DO NOT BUY THE VARIETY PACK. It’s not worth it for me at least because I’m not going to drink all of them.",positive

I love the flavor and it truly is what I consider the best. But it is quite expensive and it has 80 calories for a 6.4 ounce can. I have purchased the following in an attempt to find a suitable replacement with fewer calories and perhaps be nicer for my pocketbook. Yunker wins hands down. I will continue to buy this even at the exorbitant price and loaded calorie count. . It’s just so perfect.

Here are my feelings about the other drinks I have purchased:

Optimum nutrition amino energy drink, Peach Bellini — actually pretty delicious and I could be inclined to switch totally. My only one problem is it’s a bit too sweet but otherwise delicious and much less expensive.

Equo life sparkling energy drink, mango peach AND guarana champagne — actually pretty delicious and I could be inclined to switch totally. It is pretty equal to the Optimum Nutrition Amino Energy Drink. My only one problem is the taste is not as good (to me) as Yunker but otherwise delicious and much less expensive. It is not too sweet.

Artisn prebiotic tonic, variety pack AND Zevia Ginger Beer AND Remedy Ginger Beer — okay. I absolutely have to add about 3 nice sized squirts of liquid stevia to be able to say I enjoy it. I will probably not buy any of these three again.

I have been buying Sparkling Ice Drinks for a long time and will not stop. They are delicious and the price is right (about $1.00 per bottle). No calories but none of the benefits of the above drinks. But I don’t like drinking plain water and this allows me to drink 64 ounces of liquid a day, added to my many cups of unsweetened tea.",positive

And I have tried many - all the popular brands out there. My last favorite no sugar / low calorie soda drink was Zevia. But Sparkling Ice beats Zevia out of the park and is now my favorite mainly because of its taste. This is as close to a soda with sugar as it gets. Honestly there's almost no difference. Zevia clearly tastes like diet / no sugar soda. For health reasons, it's great. But Sparkling Ice really surprised me with how good it tastes while also having no sugar.

I would love to give it 5 stars but there is one issue - freshness. I've bought 4 different packs now and unfortunately, 2 of them have very little sparkling in them. Drinks almost like juice. The other 2 were perfect full of sparkles. So yeah, because of this I have to give it only 4 stars. If they were put into cans, maybe that will preserve their sparklingness.",positive

This is probably my new favorite flavor, although I also love the Ultra Violet and Ultra Blue.

One of the downsides of ordering Monster Ultra from Amazon is that the price varies greatly for unknown reasons. My local grocery has flavors for $33.99 and $32.99 when on sale. But on Amazon I have seen them for as cheap as $26.99 (pre pandemic) to now the Ultra Blue is currently priced at $52.xx. Y'all killing me, smalls.

If you compare Monster Ultra (140-150mg caffeine/16 ounces) to 2 cups of black coffee it actually comes out to be less caffeine, so it's healthier, tastes better, comes in its' own portable container which can be re-used as a water bottle later in the day to hydrate. PLUS you don't wait in line for it or have a barista misspell your name. Monster Ultra: 1, coffee: 0.

30,Grocery & Gourmet Food,"Lavazza Classico Ground Coffee Blend, Medium Roast",$7.48 - $284.97,5,"THE BOTTOM LINE: Gran Crema is an EXCELLENT blend of coffee to make cappuccinos and lattes, producing an incredibly velvety crema. The espresso drinker who prefers a stronger taste and full body will also certainly enjoy this roast blend.

Tastes: If everyone had the same tastes and liked the same things, there would only be one coffee in the world. Finding the ""perfect"" coffee is a personal decision tailored by your own taste and likes, and even then, many times you want to have something different or change, therefore in finding YOUR perfect coffee, it depends on your present tastes and moods at that one particular moment in time...which can change. My best advice is follow your feelings and have a try at different things to find NOT what you like, but what you DEFINITELY do not like. And most certainly do not buy or force yourself to like something, because others do like it or love it. Buy for you, not for them.

Coffee basics: 2 types of beans. Arabica, which have a smoother taste in general but have lighter body and make less crema, and Robusto, which make more crema and have a stronger taste and body but carry more bitterness. Plants are grown in warmer climates all around the globe, and each place yields beans with distinct flavors regardless of the same bean used. The roasting of the coffee, different machines, water quality and grind quality also add to these differences. Tamping (espresso styles) and amount of coffee makes a very minimal difference compared to all the other factors, and everyone gets the hang of it with practice (i.e. no need to focus so much on pressures and exact weight and times). WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT: the WATER!, the quality of the coffee, the right grind for the style you are making (finer for espresso and Turkish, coarser for other styles), and a good machine for that style, which is NOT synonymous with expensive (stove tops are not). You get these 4 things right, and all the other factors won't matter much, and you will have an excellent coffee every time. The water here where I live is horrible, and so was my coffee, so I had to spend quite a lot on a filtration system for the water.

Italian coffee: Our preferred styles are espresso, cappuccino, and latte (it really means milk and the original Italian name is caffè e latte, but we have dropped the ""e"" over time) and all are served hot. In Italy, flavors/things added to these styles are only found in places where tourists are (i.e. no creams, cinnamon, iced, etc) and most Italians do not even consider or have heard of adding anything else, other than sugar. In Italian bars (this is what we call coffee shops in Italy and why they're called baristas) ALL coffee is a blend of arabica and robusta, making them versatile. ALL bars in Italy also use whole milk, typically what we call lunga conservazione which stores at room temperature until opened (hence less refrigeration storing space needed). You might find places that use more than just whole milk in tourist areas, but is not a certainty. Whole milk froths better than other milk. Coffee is quite important in Italy, so much that the price of coffee is strictly regulated and has been, long before the owners of Starbucks were even born.

Lavazza: Most sold coffee brand in Italy. Lavazza makes 2 lines of coffee geared to the preferred Italian styles, one for home use, and one commercial, but each and every one of them is different from each other and any coffee in the home line is totally different from any one in the commercial line. The home line consists of:
1. Qualità Oro - 100% Arabica beans from a blend of Central America and African highlands. Medium roast.
2. Qualità Rossa - 70% Brasilian arabica and 30% African robusta. Medium roast.
3. Gran Aroma - 60% arabica and 40% robusta. All Brasilian. Medium roast.
4. Gran Crema - 40% South America arabica and 60% Southeast Asia robusta. Dark roast.
5. Crema e Aroma - 30% South America arabica and 70% African robusta. Medium roast.

Qualità Rossa is the most readily available in Italy and hence the less expensive and most used/sold in Italy also. Qualità Oro is aimed at espresso style, Gran Crema is aimed at cappuccino and latte styles, with Gran Bar and Qualità Rossa being more versatile. Qualità Rossa seems to most to have a balance IN TASTE (smooth vs. strong) between arabica and robusta. The entire Lavazza home line is excellent Italian roast espresso coffee but is best to stick Gran Crema (mixing) and Qualità Oro (straight) for what they're geared for, and in the proper use you will find the correct taste, smoothness, and next to no bitterness, if any at all. They are all superb for use in the right manner and none of them are oily.

About me: I definitely do not like bitter or oily coffee (all coffee is oily per se, but I do not like coffee that has a distinct film of oil on top, which you can see at an angle and which is typically bitter coffee). I prefer cappuccinos and ""lattes"", but regardless I like a strong taste and therefore use Gran Crema, but I do enjoy espresso also so I do use Gran Aroma, which still has enough strong taste for my cappuccinos and lattes. My family in Italy in general prefer espressos and use Qualità Oro, but also use Qualità Rossa (much much less). You will only see me at Starbucks in case of dire emergency, which translates to 3 times in 20 years (once after an 18 hour travel marathon in planes). I'm not even mentioning any other coffee places. I use a Gaggia at home and drink tea while I travel. My entire family owns Gaggias. Not because we're married to the brand, but because we have tried plenty others, but Gaggias last us much better than the rest. My mother's must be at least 30 years old. However, one glance at her stove top will convince you it was around before Metusela.

Anecdote: I was quite entertained when I learned about the craziness to obsess over tamping pressures, weighing, and stopwatches. Out of curiosity on a British espresso machine that uses no electricity or stove (but you have to have boiling water so you need it anyway), I found a video of this American guy showing the ROK coffee maker which was totally obsessed with this and I learned that it was quite common. I told my mother, who laughed, and shared it at the local bar in her neighborhood the next morning. The barista (our friend) had to call me at 4 a.m. my time (it's ok, mamma has been doing it all these years). He almost didn't believe me. I had to send him youtube links, including the ROK guy. He asked ""Are they crazy? People believe we use scales and stopwatches at the bars?"" About tamping he said it's common sense. It has to be compact enough so that you get the flavor out of the coffee, but not too compact that breaks the pump on the machine.",positive

Gave a half cup with the other half being milk to my Mom to taste and she said it was a very good coffee but that it could be strong, told her it was half strength and she was surprised at how strong it was.

I've been searching for a good tasting coffee in recent years but I suspect climate change is taking its toll because the coffee hasn't tasted good, I suppose more Robusta is being used than Arabica. This coffee is more like what I'm accustomed to so I will continue to buy.",positive

33,Grocery & Gourmet Food,"Lavazza Classico Ground Coffee Blend, Medium Roast",$7.48 - $284.97,4,"I have yet to find a comparable locally-roasted decaf bean that won't break the bank, so apparently I still want to buy beans that circumnavigated the Earth. I stopped drinking so much coffee after I figured out it was just functioning on my nervous system like any other stimulant - forcing me to put the petal to the metal when I was running on empty. In any case, my husband was getting headaches, so he switched to decaf, and he has been enjoying this headache-free. It still seems to bother me, and I am wondering if it is because I had it unfiltered. There are two terpene compounds in coffee, cafestol and kahweol, which are bound by paper filter material, but present in high quantities in unfiltered coffee. These compounds bind vitamin B6 and over time can cause deficiencies. Studies in the Turkish population showed that drinking unfiltered coffee also caused cholesterol to become elevated. It's worth looking into the health effects of these compounds, especially if you're struggling with mood or fatigue issues.

I am coming to realize that coffee is not a particularly sustainable habit, and I'm questioning the wisdom of drinking it daily. Buying this instead of going to a coffee shop probably isn't going to help you save up for a house downpayment, but at $5/day and $1825/year (for just one person), it's still something! Perhaps a month of rent, depending on where you live.",positive

These whole beans were the same way. I opened the bag and WHOA BUDDY! IS IS LIBERTY CALL IN THE GUT???? ( seedy section of Napoli )
First extraction used 11 clicks in on a C2 max, 15 grams whole bean, 175 F. water, Aeropress inventor recipe. Very good.
Cold brew extraction with aero press using same grind was correct as well.
The aroma after taking them out th' bag is lacking that initial injury of old memories. The taste leans towards richer end of bright toward medium in some front end flavors and the acid is mild. Grind is darker than say Kimbo Dulce light roast. Still very 'bright' (?).

40,Grocery & Gourmet Food,"The Original Donut Shop Dark, Single-Serve Keurig K-Cup Pods, Dark Roast Coffee Pods, 72 Count",$19.89 - $129.13,4,"It’s a pretty good coffee. Your standard medium roast. The k-cup pods make it quick and easy to make yourself a cup of coffee in the morning. Really, it’s hard to complain about a decent medium roast coffee. But one thing you sacrifice for the convenience of a pre packaged pod is price.

It’s way more economical to buy a can of coffee, than it is to buy a package of k-cups. The can allows you to measure out exactly how much you need with little to no waste, and you generally get more of it for the same price of a box of k-cups. However, if you’re in a rush, or are just generally lazy about making your coffee, then the pods are definitely the way to go.

There’s also the waste issue to consider. Yeah, they advertised that the k-cups are recyclable. But if you’re using pods because you are rushed or lazy, then you’re definitely not going to take the time to open, clean out, and recycle the k-cups like they recommend. It would be better if they just made their pods compostable. It would probably make them more expensive in the long run. But if you’re using pods because of their convenience, then you’ve already decided that the convenience is more important than the price per ounce.

All in all, it’s a decent product that is very convenient and tastes good. But it’s not as great as it could be. I like the convenience for the days where I’m in a hurry. But I still wish that the end result was better for the environment.",positive

It was packaged very well and none of my pods have ever been damaged when ordering through Amazon.com. I do have an account for Nespresso.com to get most of my coffee needs there. But some of the new coffees take a little bit for the order to be put together and sent. This is fully understandable as coffee takes a bit of time to roast up. I like that while I am waiting on my order from Nespresso, I can get my coffee fix fulfilled through Amazon.com! While you do need to keep an eye on who the seller actually is, Amazon.com normally is a great go-to for anything I have needed! What E-Bay USE to be, before they were overrun by scammers. Amazon.com seems to be really good at weeding those types out of their platform.
Another thing I do enjoy ordering my 'replacement' pods while waiting on the order from Nespresso, is the payment options that I have available here. There is a lot more flexibility (by that I mean payment options) on what is accepted.
I do prefer Nespresso coffee from Nespresso, BUT I also enjoy the Nespresso coffee from Amazon as well! As I said, you as the consumer, need to pay attention to the seller. And you can not return foodstuffs. Keep that in mind! Once you find a seller, if it is not Amazon.com directly, through Amazon.com that you do like than be a return customer to that seller that is working with Amazon! :)

While these coffee pods seem to have morea for pick up and go/caffeine, the taste is not as good as Starbucks or Keurig varieties. The hazelnut tasted burnt, and there was barely any hint of a vanilla flavor in the vanilla cream cake. Needless to say, I had still had to add flavoring, sugar, and milk to make it tolerable.

120,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Tea Parent,$6.99 - $54.99,4,"I’m a big jasmine green tea fan and LOVE my Rishi loose jasmine green tea, but it’s gone up a lot in price so I’ve been looking for decent, cheaper jasmine green teabags and given the reviews here I was hopeful this might be it. I was further encouraged when I opened the package and was hit immediately by a strong jasmine scent reminiscent of my excellent loose jasmine green. Unfortunately, in the all-important flavor area this tea falls a bit short. Despite the wonderful fragrance, very little jasmine flavor makes it into the actual tea so it tastes more like a mild green tea than a true jasmine green tea, but I will say this is still much better than most other bagged jasmine green teas I’ve tried and it’s organic, used bags without bad chemicals, and is environmentally conscious. So all this on balance this will be my new, cheaper daily drinker until I can find something better.

But another use for these teabags is in making really good, healthy, and cost-effective iced tea. Put 6 teabags into a glass pitcher and heat 6 cups of water to 180 degrees (a full boil will cook the green tea leaves and spoil the flavor. I highly recommend using filtered or bottled water in an electric kettle with temperature control (filtered/bottled water tastes MUCH better than tap water with delicate green tea and doesn’t leave sediment in the kettle). Pour the hot water over the teabags and let steep for 10-20 minutes depending on your desired strength and level of caffeine — most of the health benefits of green tea infuse fairly quickly into the hot water, and the longer it steeps the more caffeine you’ll get. Let the tea cool in the pitcher for about a half hour before putting it in the fridge unless your glass pitcher can survive going from hot to cold without cracking, and when it’s cold you’ll have delicious tasting, healthy, and zero-calorie iced tea you don’t even have to add anything to due to the jasmine flowers providing a nice yet subtle hint of flavor that makes it incredibly light and refreshing. I much prefer this to regular black iced tea, and you’re getting the superior health benefits of organic green tea. Try it. You’ll love it!",positive

125,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Tea Parent,$6.99 - $54.99,5,"Review for: Organic Earl Grey Loose Leaf Tea 16oz bag (1pound), bought September 2020.

The underlying black tea is a good mix of Keemun and Assam. The Keemun makes for a lighter tea that does not drown out the Bergamotte oil, or force an amount that makes the tea taste soapy. Twinings itself has replaced most of the real Bergamotte oil with extract and their website doesn't say how much real Bergamotte is left. I still like Twinings Earl Grey, it's been my family tea for more than half a century, but knowing that this organic product uses only the real thing (2% organic Bergamotte content, as per ingredient list) is an extra star in my book. The tea that arrived was super fresh with an aromatic scent (expiry date end of January 2023), which is important as the bergamotte oil fragrance and tea aroma will evaporate over time.
The taste is a delicious, light to medium strength Earl Grey, great on its own or (for lighter taste) mixed with 1/3rd Darjeeling. If you are used to soapily strong Earl Grey variants or those made with Assam alone, you may find it too light. If you like Twinings, you'll probably like it alot.

I have not been able to do a direct taste comparison side by side, as I ran out of Twinings before this arrived, but as I am sitting here, sipping a cup of the hot, dark-golden liquid with a small teaspoon of cane sugar, tasting a well balanced mix of light black tea and bergamotte oil, I am letting out a satisfied sigh. I am finding this one to be an excellent substitute.

Update 2021: Had 3 1-pound-bags of this in the meantime, and all of them were perfectly aromatic and tasty.

Preparation instructions:
Serve in thin-lipped bone-china cups of approx. 6oz size (better sensory experience than mugs for delicate teas, see image).
Use 2 tea pots and a straining sieve: one pot to steep the leaves and another to strain the brewed tea into, in order to get the leaves out before they turn bitter.

Bring 3 cups / 24 oz of water to boil, pour over 6g (0.22oz) Earl Grey tea leaves while still boiling. The leaves should float freely in a pre-warmed tea pot. For less or more tea, just multiply or divide water and tea by the same amounts.
Strain after no longer than 3 minutes of steeping through a tea-straining sieve into the serving tea pot. (I am setting a timer to 2:40 min brewing time and don't stress over 20 seconds more). When I strain the tea, I either stirr the leaves right before, or let the leaves drip from the sieve after straining, to get all the full, concentrated tea. (if you accidentally steeped it too long, you can try decanting without stirring the leaves and it might save you from a bitter experience). I drink it with a little cane sugar and a piece of bread with something sweet on it, and thereafter, my brain starts working. If you are a Trekkie and have not tried what Picard's favorite drink really is about when properly prepared, this is it. If yours is bitter, you either use too much tea or you let it steep too long.

Oh, and I never use tea bags for black tea. It is filled with the tea dust that is breaking off from the properly dried tea leaves, the leftover after the leaves have been packaged. That tends to make for an overpoweringly strong tea, plus the dust tends to seep into the tea itself. Either that or (with luxury versions=filled with proper leaves) it does not have enough room for giving off its taste. Free floating is the way to go.
If you want to avoid the garbage getting all wet, just leave the used leaves to drip and dry in the sieve over the pot you used for steeping before throwing them away.

Disclaimer: this is the first time ever I bought this product. I have picked and paid it myself and have nothing whatsoever to do with either FGO, Amazon or Twinings. This is a pure tea enthusiast's review article and I hope you enjoyed it and your tea.",positive
126,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Tea Parent,$6.99 - $54.99,5,"I've been drinking this for a little over a week now. I have chronic migraines, either RA or Lupus (still waiting for the Dr to decide), can go through periods of chronic UTI's, PCOS, and all the lovely fatigue, brain fog, pain, extreme difficulty losing weight, etc that go along with these issues. The first thing I noticed with this tea was when I had a bad UTI and that night I started drinking the tea. That tea completely got rid of my UTI. I was completely pain free in less then 2 days! Antibiotics have never worked that well for me. I recently started adding the lemon and honey and have been losing about .5lbs to 1lbs per day. I've been eating healthier for a couple of months maybe more and had lost about 7-8 lbs. I'm now down 11lbs which is 4-5lbs since drinking the tea. I didn't want to do a crash diet to lose a ton of weight fast. I wanted to make changes that wouldn't leave me feeling starving or unable to have the yummy things when I craved them (within reason of course). I just didn't want to feel so restricted and miserable like so many other diets made me feel.

If you've never heard of moringa tea I'm telling you you need to read up on it! Also I have heard many stories of how this tea helped with infertility. Josh and I tried for about a year to get pregnant. We tried everything... diets, supplements, prescriptions, etc. A friend introduced this to me and after a month of drinking this we got pregnant.

I'm not getting any benefits for posting this. I know others have the same issues I do and even worse. Just wanted to share my experience with this in hopes that it may benefit someone else. Would love to hear anyone else's experience with Moringa tea too!

It may work in the older Keurig machines (and I’ve read that it does work in Keurig 2.0 designs), but works only sporadically in the multi-port machines. This is due to to things: 1) The SFB pod is very flexible (the top surface bends easily and away from the injector pins), and 2) there is a seal layer just under the pod top surface that tends to resist puncture.

Fortunately we have not had any two bad k-cups in sequence, and as we have probably fifteen or so k-cups left, I would imagine we’ll have others explode before they’re gone.

190,Grocery & Gourmet Food,"Nespresso Capsules VertuoLine, Melozio, Medium Roast Coffee, 30 Count Coffee Pods, Brews",$36.00 - $36.55,5,"NOTE: just read some of the negative reviews on here posted after my original review. Some people are saying they received knock-offs. I suggest that if someone thinks they have received an inauthentic sleeve of pods to contact Nespresso direct with photos to confirm before posting it in a review. I have never received anything but authentic pods and have purchased dozens and dozens of sleeves on Amazon and direct from Nespresso. I have found that sometimes Nespresso changes the design on the foil and recently the boxes changed to reduce waste. If a seller is sending out fake pods this needs to be reported to Amazon and Nespresso. However I think that it is more likely that the customers have just received a redesigned package. That said please read on for my review...

When I first started using my new Vertuoline Nespresso machine, the Hazelino (you may be interested in my review for that too) quickly - and surprisingly to me, became my favorite.
But the Melozio pods have now surpassed the Hazelino pods for me.

I am always on the hunt for a medium roast, toasty rich, well rounded, strong yet mellow coffee. Some lighter roasted coffees taste sour to me, and some of the Nespresso pods do too. When I discussed that with my coffee expert daughter she said that is common with light roasts but that the flavor of the coffee comes through more strongly with a light roast which is why the light roasts have become so popular. But now I know why I never really liked many light roasted coffees.
That said Nespresso has produced some light roasts without that sourness I dislike so much. If you don’t like sour notes to your coffee, these are the best Vertuoline pods in my opinion.

Hazelino (rated intensity 6 - slightly roasted Brazilian and Central American Arabicas) has a touch of that light roasted sourness too, but not as much as some of the others. It is made more full bodied with the toasty nutty flavor, which is why it was my favorite.

Until I tried the Melozio (rated intensity 6 – lightly roasted Brazilian Bourbon and Central American Arabicas)The Melozio doesn't have any hint of that aforementioned sourness. For those who enjoy a toasty, mellow, well balanced cup of coffee without any burnt taste or sourness or bitterness Melozio might be for you! To me it is the most mellow and balanced tasting of the 7.77oz pods.

I have tried all of the pods currently available, and my all time favs are Melozio, Hazelino, Voltesso Espresso and the new Colombia Master Origin (a bit heavier but I love it with lots of half and half)

The Voltesso Espresso (intensity 4 – lightly roasted South American Aribicas) is to me, easily the most well balanced, delicious pod of all. I absolutely love it. I only wish they had the same blend in a 7.77oz pod. A 1.35oz espresso is a quick, indulgent second cup for me, but could never take the place of my morning 7.77oz coffee. So unless they produce the Voltesso in a larger pod, Melozio is my go-to most mornings.

If I want a bit of a stronger hit for those low energy mornings, I will have a Colombia Master Origin (intensity 5 – Colombian Augadas light roast blended with a small amount of the same darker roasted beans).
If I am feeling very dull, and I need a second hit, I reach for a Voltesso Espresso.
If I want a coffee in the afternoon I will sometimes have a decaf. Nespresso’s decaf is another winner for me flavor-wise. (Intensity 7 – Dark roasted Costa Rican Arabica blended with long roasted Colombian Arabica) or Nespresso Half Caffeinato (Intensity 5 – A blend of Caffeinated and Decaffeinated Arabicas from Brazil and Africa)

All round if you are like me, and enjoy mellow, toasty, strong but not burnt tasting, rich but not acidic coffee and you are new to Nespresso Vertuoline, start with Melozio 7.77oz, Colombia Master Origin 7.77oz, Voltesso Espresso 1.35oz and Decaf or Half Caf 7.77oz.

If this has helped you, would you please click the helpful button? I spend a lot of time on my reviews because there is a lot of junk out there and I like to think that my reviews help filter out the crap for other like-minded buyers who are hunting for the same products that I am :) It makes it worthwhile when I see that people have been helped by my reviews.

200,Grocery & Gourmet Food,"Hint Water Bottles, Zero Sugar, Zero Calories, Zero Sweeteners, Zero Preservatives, Zero Artificial Flavors",$10.28 - $50.08,5,"So I’m a fan of Hint water. The flavors are pretty accurate. The Cherry is my favorite, but lately it’s been a lot less flavorful than it used to be, and especially in comparison to the other flavors. For example the Crisp Apple (green) tastes exactly like a crisp green apple and you can’t miss it. With the Cherry, sometimes it’s hard to even taste it.

I wish there was more of a variety on Amazon in the 12 packs. I assume they don’t have all the flavors on Amazon to push you to their website.

The cost:
Most of the time, for a 12 pack of the Cherry flavor, it’s around $13 which I find reasonable. On their website, a pack of 12 bottles at 16oz is $21.99 and $17.99 if you subscribe to have them continuously shipped. I find that very unreasonable. It’s water. With a little bit of flavor. I go through 12 bottles fairly fast because I drink a lot of liquids, especially during the summer. I noticed they had 12 packs of 32oz bottles and figured that would be the best way to go. However, at $32.99 per 12 pack, I couldn’t rationalize it. It’s not any cheaper on Amazon.

So while o really like Hint water overall, I feel their prices are highway robbery. I did place an order on their website a couple months ago. They have a deal for new customers where you get to choose 3 packs from any of their 12oz 12 packs, and it’s $36 dollars. I find that reasonable.

At some grocery stores a bottle is $0.89, at others it’s $2.50 for 16oz.

Now don’t get me wrong. I have no problem paying extra for something I really like. I’m a conscious shopper, but I don’t just grab the cheapest of everything. I will pay a premium for a product I really like, but $2.50 for a 16oz bottle of semi, semi flavored is a once in awhile splurge, not something that’s on the weekly grocery list.",positive

210,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Zevia Zero Calorie Soda,$15.18 - $58.95,5,"I want to start my review by mentioning that the taste and experience you have with Zevia will have ALOT to do with the diet and food you surround it with. As a Registered Nurse who has modified their diet to decrease my intake of sugar and concentrated sweets for personal health reasons, I can say that I had a much different experience with the ZEVIA line before I watched my diet and limited sweets, to now where I try to limit my intake of sugar to fruits only and to less than 20 grams total a day. That being said, I have broken down my review into two sections, the review of the flavors themselves, and the ZEVIA product line overall. For non Zevia drinkers, just know that the main issue to get over with any Zevia product is the classic Stevia aftertaste that can stay on your palette. How much that aftertaste bothers you is influenced by your typical sugar intake in your daily diet in my personal opinion. If I ate a diet like I used to, I know that Zevia products would taste weird at best, and bitter and bad at worst.

(REVIEW OF THE TASTES)

Cola/Caffeine Free Cola, 5/5- As mentioned in other parts of my review, I was and still am a HUGE fan of bottled Mexican coke which uses real sugar instead of High Fructose Corn Syrup. Since starting my low sugar diet, the Cola flavored Zevia has been a much welcomed substitute instead. I know some people mentioned issues with the clear vs. colored Zevia, but I have only tried the clear Cola and have enjoyed it on the several occasions I've tried it. If you need a healthy Coke/Pepsi substitute, this is a great flavor to start with. 5/5

Ginger Root Beer, 4.5/5- Growing up, I can't say that I was a big fan of root beer, but I did have it occasionally or with root beer floats. I'm not sure if the Root Beer Zevia will work for floats, but in terms of a root beer substitute the flavor is spot on. I know that if I was a big Root Beer person, the Ginger Root Beer Zevia would work fine for me.

Ginger Ale, 5/5- Not so much as a teenager, but more as an adult I've begun to develop a fondness for ginger ale. Having changed to a low sugar diet, the Ginger Ale Zevia Flavor has become my go to flavor of choice and the one I drink and order the most. Personally, the Ginger Ale flavor is the lightest in the Zevia lineup in terms of a strong flavor, so to me this is the perfect carbonated drink to have with a big meal or dinner that most people can enjoy.

Cream Soda, 5/5- Let me start off by saying, that since having Vanilla Cream Coca Cola back in High School, I have not had any Cream soda since in my lifetime. But since it came in the variety pack, and it was the only cold soda in the fridge one night, I gave it a shot and it tastes like classic Cream Soda. This may or may not be your favorite flavor, but if it is, to me it was spot on.

Grape, 5/5- In terms of fruit, my go to flavor is Orange. Since the Grape was available in the variety pack, I gave it a try one night and it wasn't bad at all. If I had to say anything, I would say that Grape Zevia does more Justice to Grape than Orange does for Orange in my opinion. Grape has not been a big soda favorite in my life but if it is for you, the Grape Zevia wouldn't be a bad substitute to try.

Black Cherry, 4.5/5- Tried it as part of the variety pack, can't say I'm a fan of black cherry soda in general, but it does the flavor justice. If you like Black cherry, the Zevia flavor is a good substitute.

Lemon Lime Twist 5/5- One of my favorite flavors for personal reasons, The lemon lime twist has been a good substitute for sprite, sierra mist, and other lime flavored soda, so this is a great zevia flavor to get.

Orange 3/5- Growing up, Orange flavored soda was always in my top 5 soda flavors to have. As a big fan of the Zevia flavor line, I was surprised to be slightly disappointed with the Orange flavor Zevia take. As I mention in my grape soda flavor review, I felt that Grape Flavor did more justice to grape that the Orange Flavor does to Orange. Unlike the classic Zevia aftertaste that you need to get used to, my issue with the orange was the citric acid taste that stayed in my mouth and just gives the soda to much of an artificial taste. Still tolerable, but not in my top 5 Zevia flavors for sure and not one of the flavors I would pay for.

Mountain Zevia 5/5- Growing up, I was not a big Mountain Dew fan, but would have it occasionally if there was nothing else available or at parties. I have to say, that the Zevia take on Mountain Dew was pleasantly surprising, and for any fan of the Dew, the Mountain Zevia soda is an excellent substitute.

Dr. Zevia 5/5- Growing up, I had my classic soda flavors that I would have more often than I should have for health reasons, and Dr. Pepper was one of those sodas. When I tried the Dr. Zevia Flavor, I found it enjoyable and a great substitute to the real thing.

Grapefruit Citrus 4.5/5- Growing up, Squirt was one of my favorite sodas, followed by the sugar free version from Pepsi Fresca. In terms of Zevia flavors, the Grapefruit Citrus is a good attempt at interpreting those sodas. The Grapefruit Citrus is not one of my personal top 5 Zevia favorite flavors, but if your a big fan of Grapefruit sodas, Squirt, or Fresca, give Grapefruit Citrus a shot.

(REVIEW OF THE ACTUAL ZEVIA PRODUCT ITSELF)
As a nurse, I deal with many patients that have multiple ailments and comorbidities, most of which having issues with either diet, or exercise. One of the most important topics that I can ever teach or talk to someone about is the danger of Sugar (mostly Fructose, but Sucrose and Glucose are included as well) and its impact on overall health, especially if your diabetic. This is a topic that I can really get into and has motivated me to become either a nutritionist or a diabetic educator in the future, but that's another topic for another day. Anyways, I've realized that for many, decreasing sugar intake is a problem and difficult, but especially for those who carelessly drink concentrated sources of sugar daily, mostly in the for of juices or sodas. When educating patients, of course complete to 98% elimination of sugar entirely (15-20 grams or less is what experts have agreed upon) would be best for their overall health, this of course is not realistic for many for various reasons. Instead, I at least encourage the elimination of concentrated sweets. Because many have grown accustomed with having sugary beverages, or fizzy drinks with some or even all meals, I usually recommend Zevia for those people. Though there have been studies on artificial sugars and their link to cancer, and though some diet sodas don't have some of those cancerous ingredients anymore, the fact is that artificial coloring can have unwanted health effects, and artificial sugars besides the whole cancer thing, throw your body's natural regulation of sugar and insulin off in the long run. So in researching better options for patients and for myself, I came across Zevia. It has been noted that there is no long term research from the effects of stevia on the body in the long run (or monk fruit), but research that is available is promising (following taken from healthyeating.sfgate.com):

1) Glucose Control- The effect of steviol glycosides in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics was evaluated in a study published in 2008 in the ""Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology"" journal. The results showed that post-treatment blood glucose levels were not significantly different from baseline measurements in the groups that were given stevia. Additionally, stevia was well tolerated by the subjects and had no side effects.

2) Insulin Sensitivity- A study published in 2005 in the ""Hormone and Metabolic Research"" journal evaluated the effect of stevioside, a glycoside in Stevia rebaudiana, in rats fed a diet consisting of 60 percent fructose. Stevioside was found to decrease plasma-glucose concentrations, improve insulin sensitivity and delay the development of insulin resistance in the rats. Based on these results, the authors concluded that stevia may also be helpful for diabetics.

3) Weight Control- Stevia has no calories. In contrast, a gram of sugar contains about 4 calories, and there are about 4 grams of sugar in a teaspoon. If you put 3 teaspoons of sugar in your coffee, that's 48 calories for just 1 cup of coffee. Using stevia in place of sugar can help you maintain and achieve a healthy weight. That's important because more than 80 percent of people with Type 2 diabetes are overweight.

Besides diabetic health and sugar regulation, the ingredients are definitely more natural derived than those in other sodas. I recommend Zevia as a nurse to many people I meet and have become a big fan of it myself over the last 6 months. Though the taste may be lacking in certain flavors compared to a 30-46 gram sugary soda (mexican coke bottles are my favorite and perfect example), it all depends on the food you eat/drink around the Zevia. As someone that has really watched sugar intake in all forms as part of their diet, Zevia is very sweet and gratifying, but I know that if I were to eat/snack like I used to, drink soda, eat frosted flakes for breakfast, have a high sugar protein bar as a snack, and eat at yogurtland 3-4 times a week like I used to, Zevia would probably taste alot worse. Take it from someone that knows how tempting, delicious, and dangerous sugary foods/drinks can be, trying to be a healthier person starts with making the right decisions every day, and Zevia can be one of those decisions.",positive
211,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Zevia Zero Calorie Soda,$15.18 - $58.95,5,"I went KetoCarnivore recently but never heard of this product. WHY? Because there are many, many opinions, videos, books etc. on the whole Keto and Keto Carnivore way of eating but an awful lot of this info is conflicting and is strictly someone's un-educated opinion. To be clear, YOU need to do your own research and only trust those people who are credible and have done research on what they are telling you, do not blindly follow and believe just anyone, we are talking about your HEALTH here. If their opinion sounds really far-fetched, beware.
Anyway, for myself I have pretty much settled on the advice of several professionals I follow on You Tube, Dr. Ken D. Berry, a family physician, and Dr. Sten Ekberg, Olympic decathlete & holistic doctor, both also have books for sale on Amazon. I recently watched a video by Dr. Ekberg and he mentioned Zevia. I listened and watched his facts presentation and was very impressed with them. The only sweetener in Zevia is Stevia. I am well acquainted with Stevia since I have used it for many years. And, since I am determined to not buy any more P***i soda I was looking for a carbonated beverage that would meet my requirements for my eating plan. Did a search on Amazon and up it popped. I liked the ingredients and promptly ordered a case.
For those of you who don't like the taste of Stevia, well, I'm sorry. It does have an aftertaste but I am so used to it it doesn't bother me at all. I don't consider it bitter or bad, it's just there. Others may try it and say yuck! Our perceptions are different! For the price, this multi-flavor case is the best way to try several flavors. Some I found were overpowered by the Stevia but I am mainly after the fizz and sweetness. Good luck!",positive
212,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Zevia Zero Calorie Soda,$15.18 - $58.95,5,"Making the switch to drinking Zevia sweetened by stevia leaf-extract for the first time is like making the switch to diet soda from regular soda. There is a distinct flavor that you might not like at first, but it will eventually grow on you. But you gotta do it for the health reasons and before you know it, your palete will adjust. Here is my rundown of the different Zevia flavors. This is after years of drinking diet soda.

Cola - Doesn't taste like any other cola I've had. I could be wrong but, it's more like a sarsaparilla with notes of bubble gum.

Root Beer - This flavor marries well with the stevia sweetener. If you're a root beer aficionado though, you might miss the caramel/molasses flavor.

Ginger Ale - Very strong ginger flavor here. This one is a winner if you like ginger ales. It even slightly tickled my nose the way old-fashioned ginger ales do.

Cream Soda - I'm not sure what makes cream soda creamy but this one is lacking it. On the plus side, this flavor profile (like the Root Beer) masks the stevia well.

Grape - Nice grape flavor. I don't have much expectations from a grape soda and this version didn't disappoint.

Black Cherry - Winner! Winner! Chicken dinner! Best flavor of the batch!

Lemon Lime - This one was just OK. Not much to complain about, but not very exciting either.

Orange - Maybe it's because I love orange soda, but this flavor didn't do it for me. It tastes like eating one of those Smarties candies.

Mountain Zevia - Not what I expected and like the Lemon Lime flavor it just wasn't memorable.

Dr. Zevia - My first impression was that this tastes like medicine. Yuck! But after a few cans, it has kind of grown on me and actually reminds me of a red Ice Tickles freezer pop. Not my first choice, but if it was in my fridge, I would drink it with no complaints.

Grapefruit Citrus- This one was not bad. It was kind of lacking in grapefruit flavor when compared to a can of Squirt Zero Sugar, but it will do in a pinch.

One complaint I do have is that there are just way too much bubbles. I always have to temper it before it is drinkable. But overall, I'm very satisfied with these Zevia soda drinks. In the end, I just pray that they don't find some adverse side effects of Stevia leaf-extracts. Otherwise, it's back to the drawing board again!",positive
213,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Zevia Zero Calorie Soda,$15.18 - $58.95,5,"I was never a soda drinker, I might drink a couple of sodas per week when I want something bubbly and refreshing. The Zevia sodas are the best zero-sugar zero-calorie drinks I have tried, with natural sweeteners (I personally really like Stevia). They're not too sweet, not too bubbly and the flavors are nice without having an aftertaste.

I purchased the variety pack because I love to have variety, I'm not the kind of person that couldn't drink or eat the same thing everyday. I like the compact but protective cardboard packaging the sodas come in; from the 24 cans I think only one was very slightly dented.

The 24 cans variety pack is worthwhile purchasing once the price goes down to $13-14, lower price per can than any sale in physical stores.

Below I review each individual flavor, but I never wasn't into the original sodas they try to replace (and some I haven't taste in 10-20 years).
* Cola - classic sweet cola flavor, definitely not the exact Coke or Pepsi taste, but still enjoyable
* Caffeine Free Cola - I would have expected this to taste just like the Cola flavor, but it's a more mediocre taste
* Lemon Lime Twist - perfect blend of lime and lemon, quite sweet but refreshing, a classic soda flavor
* Grape - tastes just like any other grape flavor juice, fortunately is a more mild flavor
* Mountain Zevia - sweet lime flavor
* Dr Zevia - a sweeter version of the Cola with a twist of cherry, very nice flavor
* Ginger Ale - a nice sweet ginger flavor, better than other ginger ale drink I have tried (but I still don't like ginger)
* Orange - the classic artificial orange flavor, maybe resembling Fanta or Mirinda
* Cream Soda - taste like a vanilla cupcake foam, not my cup of soda
* Grapefruit Citrus - a blend of grapefruit and sweet citrus, I wish it had more of the grapefruit bitterness
* Ginger Root Beer - I don't know how Ginger Root Beer taste, but I love this drink; somehow I don't taste ginger at all in this
* Black cherry - I love anything black cherry and this is absolutely delicious... it's dark cherry with hints of both sweetness and sourness",positive
214,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Zevia Zero Calorie Soda,$15.18 - $58.95,5,"I have ordered this a few times now, and the more that I drink it, the more that I really love it. Now, I do have a favorite root beer (Boylan Bottling Natural Root Beer Soda), however I don't always have $50 to get it. It is what it is, and I just got to make do. It was either a choice of this (Zevia) brand, or another cheaper alternative. It was the ""creamy"" part of the description that made me want to try this one.

Now, when I got them, I did try one next day (after putting some in the fridge). It was surprizingly, really, really good! And, there most definitely was no aftertaste. It was super ""creamy"", and very delicious!

Kind of related (sorry for TMI), but I do (or, did) suffer chronic constipation. My doctor had me not take any more OTC laxatives as they were making my situation far more worse (as in, they just weren't working). So, a few years ago, he started prescribing me Sorbitol (this is a sickeningly overtly-sweet sweetener/ laxative). This stuff tasted so nasty, and I had the hardest time downing a dose. Enter in, Zevia...

I was not at all, expecting any (medicinal) results from drinking Zevia. It tasted relatively good, so I was happy. But, within just half a can of consumption, I found myself running to the bathroom. Like every single day, half a can, and I just had to go immediately! So, I decided to look up ""stevia"", as I had never had that, and found out that it is in fact a natural sweetener. So, if you have a sensitivity to natural sweeteners as apparently like I do, you may want to counter in that fact, before you buy it. Now, I am usually at home (at any given time) regardless, so I prefer to still drink this (almost daily) for how it helps to correct my chronic problem, as I seem to no longer suffer it now while drinking Zevia. Sorbitol, is not recommended to take every day, only as needed. So, with drinking just a half can of Zevia, and I'm going that same day, well I can honestly say that I have not been constipated for months.

Now, I recommend drinking this straight from the can, I drink half and then put plastic wrap over the top and will drink this next day. I say this, about drinking from the can directly, because the color of it is very off-putting, I mean if you are used to drinking (normal) root beer. When you pour Zevia into a cup/ or, glass, it is crystal clear. And, I feel like I'm not drinking root beer, which then (kind of) mars the taste for me.

If you suffer chronic constipation, I'd recommend giving this a go, as it tastes a million times better than just straight up Sorbitol. All in all, I'm really glad I tried this, as it is now a permanent staple in my diet.",positive
215,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Zevia Zero Calorie Soda,$15.18 - $58.95,5,"So, I am not a soda drinker. I never have been. I have avoided it except on rare occasions because I have always been disgusted by the ingredients and the insane amount of sugar. If you're in love with your soda, this is going to obviously be different, because it IS different. I can't speak to that, though, since I don't drink other soda. I have, however, fallen in love with Zevia. I've recommended it to everyone I know, friends and family, but no one I know drinks soda either, so they're all pretty skeptical and look at me like I'm a bit confused because I'm trying to get them to drink something that has been so unhealthy for.. ever. ""But try it! It's so good!"" .. they all just pass, it's heartbreaking. Like, I made this incredible discovery and everyone just thinks I'm nuts. Uhg. I've been a seltzer drinker for a long time, but after a while it starts to taste plain and boring, (fart water.. if you know, you know) no matter the brand or flavor. Zevia, after 8 months now, has not gotten boring. I can give this to my kids and not feel like I'm poisoning them. I can drink this and not feel bad about my choices. Well, soda choices anyway, let's not get carried away. It's just really delicious, and has become a staple in our home. I highly recommend you give it an honest try.",positive
216,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Zevia Zero Calorie Soda,$15.18 - $58.95,4,"Overall Zevia sodas are pretty decent. The Ginger Ale is the most true to taste variety in my opinion. The cola is good as is the Dr. Zevia (Dr, Pepper imitation). The downside is that it is a little pricey compared to regular sodas... but in the end may be LESS expensive as you can drink as much as you want and not worry about diabetes, weight gain, or crap like Aspartame. I've had 2 cases of Zevia on auto-ship for a few years, and only once some of the cans were dented (but not ruptured). The only other Stevia sweetened soda I've been able to find is the ""Green Cola"" brand. These can be bought at Market Basket, or through Amazon, but it's pricey. In my opinion the Green cola is a bit better than the Zevia cola.",positive
217,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Zevia Zero Calorie Soda,$15.18 - $58.95,5,"*****UPDATE AS OF 8/9/2022*****

One of the ingredients listed in this brand of soda is causing me to have gastrointestinal issues. The stevia leaf extract is causing bloating, upset stomach, cramping, diarrhea, nausea, inflammation, and flatulence. I've checked with my GI doctor and was informed that it might take 1-2 weeks for my digestive system to get used to the stevia. They also stated that if my symptoms do not clear up after 2 weeks to discontinue use of this product as I might have a food intolerance to the stevia. I noticed that my symptoms only occurred on days in which I consumed 1 can. I'm still leaving my review at 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐'s because there's nothing wrong with the product. But there's something wrong with my digestive system! (It's not you, it's me!)

*****ORIGINAL REVIEW*****

5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐'s for this zero sugar, zero calorie soda!

12 Amazing flavors. (2 of each flavor)

Zero sugar!

Zero calories!

Zero aftertaste!

100% Flavor! It really does taste amazing.

For 63¢ a can, this is my new favorite soda. There's no bad aftertaste, no aftertaste at all unlike other brand name diet sodas. It's not too sweet & has just the right amount of carbonation. One case includes 2 cans of each of the 12 different flavors.

I'm VERY satisfied with this purchase.",positive
218,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Zevia Zero Calorie Soda,$15.18 - $58.95,5,"I've only recently learned about Zevia after some friends at work highly recommended it to me, and I'm very glad they did! I enjoy being able to have a beverage like soda that doesn't come with a ""sugar crash"" feeling afterward, and Zevia definitely delivers in that regard. Having several solid flavor choices is a huge plus as well, in case you ever want to switch things around.

My only questioning is regarding the delivery packaging...I ordered a 24-pack of the Creamy Root Beer flavor for myself, and another 24-pack of the Cola flavor for my fiancee, and I wonder if the plastic wrap over the cans is 100% necessary or if there are other suitable packing methods that would reduce plastic usage. Also, the Cola was packed with plastic wrap AND 4 sets of those 6-pack plastic rings, which definitely feels overkill on the plastic (not to mention being extra work to cut the rings up before disposing of them). Other than that, I appreciate what Zevia brings to the table as a soda ""alternative"" (though for me it's been a straight-up replacement), and I'm curious to see what other flavors they come out with in the future!

219,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Zevia Zero Calorie Soda,$15.18 - $58.95,4,"Really trying to cut out diet sodas as the artificial sweeteners are horrible to my health. I’m a calorie counter so drinking my calories is not something I want to do! Enter Zevia - a “healthier” alternative to diet sodas. At $13 for a 24 pack, I couldn’t resist. However, my favorite flavors really surprised me! I generally drink Diet Coke and Sprite Zero, but both the cola and lemon lime flavors did not impress me. I tried more flavors that weren’t bad, but also weren’t great. I was defeated thinking I would just have to revert back to my unhealthy diet soda ways, until I grabbed Grapefruit Citrus. WOW! So delicious and refreshing. It’s the perfect amount of sweet and citrusy. I also enjoyed Black Cherry and Ginger Ale, but Grapefruit Citrus really stole the show. My husband enjoyed the Orange flavor. From now on, I’m going to purchase the individual flavors in bulk even though they are a little pricier. I’m so happy to have found a drink to replace the diet crap!!",positive
220,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Liquid Death Mountain Water,$14.99 - $46.99,5,"I have nothing but positive things to say about Liquid Death, which has saved my life on more than one occasion (literally).

I’ll start with what happened 2 years ago- I went on a vacation where there was no shade to shield me from the triple degree weather. I had a hard time drinking water or remembering to, and basically would reach for ANY other liquid first. Well, wouldn’t you know it, I got heat stroke- big time, to the point where my body started seizing. I end up in the ER- yep, it’s severe dehydration and I’m getting told I could have died. Doctor advises me to drink more water. I stop by 7-eleven, I see these cans. I was confused at first (“why is there beer with the waters?”). I grab one out of sheer curiosity. Lo and behold, it’s the absolute best water I’ve ever tasted in my life. I end up buying out every store in my area, and eventually feel sad that I can’t find them anywhere anymore.

Then, almost exactly a year later- kidney stones, that supposedly are going to require surgery to remove. I end up ordering several cases of Liquid Death- by the time I finish the cases, my stones have passed and the doctor is bewildered. No, it wasn’t cranberry juice or some crazy diet- just this water, which I consumed enough of to eventually get $80 back when I recycled them.

And thirdly, to the biggest selling point for me- many people think it’s beer. I, myself, thought they were beers when I first saw them. As a sober person, I cannot explain to you how much of my sobriety I owe to Liquid Death- it feels like a tall boy, looks like a tall boy, but it’s water. The placebo effect of it has kept me clean for years since I discovered it, and I still reach for one after a long day at work to wind down.

Everything about this company, this brand, this water is incredible. If you live near me and are having trouble finding it- I’m sorry it’s because I still buy the entirety of stock when I find it. I can’t get enough of liquid death- thank you so much for everything you do for the planet, for the body, and for me.",positive

I normally find sparkling water extremely unpleasant, sour and don't do even a sip. This is really good. I can drink this at a normal rate, not hours trying to drink a plastic bottle of aloe juice which I thought was being recycled. Death to plastic, Liquid Death for the win. I've had two cans today and it's amazing. I haven't liked drinking water because it usually comes in a bottle and tastes like plastic. I don't trust the tap water no matter what because of all the dumping that was done up the hill. The EPA had to come in and the water is still being tested periodically. They aren't done the cleanup.

223,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Liquid Death Mountain Water,$14.99 - $46.99,5,"I'm a water person and will almost always strictly drink natural spring water. I try to avoid filtered or purified water since it doesn't do much of anything. Matter of fact, during the pandemic, the only water my family and I could g3t ahold of was the nasty purified stuff and filtered waters which, no matter how much we drank, we still felt thirsty. As the pandemic started to come to an end, we were on a mission to find some water that will help us with that thirst. We've found a few great ones, but this one right here is by far our FAVORITE water! (Netherland water from Trader Joe's comes in 2nd and Poland Spring 3rd)

They are better cold then room temperature, but tasty nonetheless. I love that I can recycle the can when I’m done and they are easy to carry around. However, I feel uncomfortable carrying them around since EVERYONE who sees me with it thinks I’m drinking alcohol - it’s very annoying since I want to proudly drink this since it’s soooo tasty, yet I can’t because I don’t want to be reported to HR for drinking water that looks like it’s in an alcohol can! I’m also fearful of drinking it in the car because I’m afraid a police officer will see me drinking it and pull me over because they think it’s a beer can. So drink at your own risk.

225,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Liquid Death Mountain Water,$14.99 - $46.99,5,"Okay, I really love this drink. I have problems staying hydrated in the summer and I am especially vulnerable to heat-related illness, but it is hard to remember to drink 64oz of water every single day.

First, this drink is delicious, the Berry-it-Alive flavor is my favorite and it's like a fruit punch kind of flavor.
I also love the Severed Lime which reminds me of 7-UP. The Mango isn't for me, but the regular sparkling water is fantastic too.

Second, flavored versions have a tiny bit of agave which really makes the flavor pop, but without adding a ton of sugar or calories to the drink. 20cal per can, which you can basically burn just sitting on your tush.

Third, buying online is much, much cheaper than buying individual cans.

Lastly, and this really should be first but they spend 10% of the profit on cleaning up plastic waste. It's called Liquid Death because they are committed to killing plastic waste.

What's really special about this drink is the combination of flavor and calories. I drink all kinds of seltzers because it's easier to drink than flat water for me, but I like these the most out of Sanzo, Spindrift, LaCroix and Bubly",positive
226,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Liquid Death Mountain Water,$14.99 - $46.99,4,"I like this brand I like that that comes in 16.9 o cans however it does lose its carbonation very very quickly and for cans so big it's hard to or to get it all down before that starts happening.
It also does start becoming becoming uncarbonated the 2nd you put ice in it which is very unfortunate.

Best thing about this? It doesn't taste stagnant! It doesn't lose it's flavor!

You'll open the can and it smells like a damn fruit snack and will remain like that for the duration of the can. Most other seltzers lose their scent and taste after 3 minutes!

250,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Gatorade Thirst Quencher Powder,$9.98 - $34.99,5,"I -hate- that Amazon doesn’t permit us to rate the vendor separately from the product because good products shouldn’t have to suffer low star reviews due to poor vendors. And it drives me crazy when I read reviews for a product and any low star reviews are (justifiable in most cases-) complaints about the vendor/shipping. That said…..

Great value for the money and great taste. I love Gatorade & having the powder allows me to save money and mix as I go instead of having to buy cases of bottles that end up 1/2 finished and forgotten and then tossed - which = more plastic waste. Also, mixing my own i can control how sweet I’d like it to be.

Shipping wise….The can was double boxed (to the size of the can) BUT with no internal cushioning of the can so any crushing of the box would in turn crush the container, as in my case. I saw in other reviews the same problem but I always seem to think, “That was just their experience.” Apparently this is a consistent problem w/ the vendor/distributor as I’m now part of that “crappy experience” club.

The top of the can was partially popped off, (in the 1st photo you can see the dent, I had to push the can back into form to get the top off safely, I wish I had taken a pic before that so the actual dent could be seen) there was powder everywhere and approx 1.5” less powder in the can. I’m sure at packaging there’s probably 1/2” - 3/4” from the rim to the powder to allow space for the scoop, as in other cans I’ve had. I know it sounds nitpicky but with all of the powder that poured out of the packaging when I opened it, that’s money if you’re budgeting for products to last you a certain amount of time. (Hence, why we miserly folks who love Gatorade shop for the values! Ha ha ha…)

Other than that, arrived on time, our delivery person is always awesome, and “blue flavored” Gatorade RULES! \m/ >_< \m/",positive
251,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Gatorade Thirst Quencher Powder,$9.98 - $34.99,5,"I'm not complaining, but seriously? No scoop?

I wish I had found this years ago! I love Gatorade and I have an autoimmune issue and get dehydrated very quickly. I rely on rehydration fluids to survive. Yes, water is wonderful. I drink a lot of water everyday. I need electrolytes in addition to fluid. Gatorade and Powerade fits the bill and tastes good.

My only issue with Gatorade has always been too much sugar. Well, that and the bottles and all that wasted plastic. This is a large canister with a pull off lid and has a huge amount of servings in it. I'm in love.

This allows me to weaken my Gatorade to the proper level for my tastebuds and get my vitamins and minerals in. I've even used this to make ice cubes. You can't go wrong with this product. I wish I were getting paid to chat this up because I can't shut up. I've told everyone.

But please, add a scoop. Or if there is one in there *somewhere* make it more easily found.",positive
252,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Gatorade Thirst Quencher Powder,$9.98 - $34.99,5,Gatorade powder is the way to go if you are drinking a lot of Gatorade. The taste is exactly the same as the Gatorade liquid you buy in the store. The big difference is that you would end up spending about $60 for the same amount of Gatorade you can make with this powder. I keep the old Gatorade bottles and it is easy to make and get the taste exactly the same. One scoop for 25 to 32 ounces and 2 scoops for 64 ounces. You save so much money on the powder over what you would pay in the store for a bottle of Gatorade it is ridiculous. Try this product you will love it.,positive
253,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Gatorade Thirst Quencher Powder,$9.98 - $34.99,5,"First off let me just say the only Gatorade flavors I've ever seen in powder form or orange and lemon lime. I didn't even know glacier freeze came in powder form too. I was beyond impressed by how well this packaging was sent to me. They put it in two cardboard boxes and use packing Puffs to ensure that it was still optimally protected. They also added a layer of protective film to ensure it doesn't spill during shipping. All these reviews that show busted, screwed up looking packaging, I feel sorry for y'all, but that was not my experience. You will not be disappointed if you buy this. This is equal to three 24 packs of Gatorade which I have only found here and Sam's club for less than 20 bucks a pack. Great value for a customer that consistently drinks this all throughout the week every single day and night for work or for home use alike. Also great for sports teams or cookouts or just pulling out at the lake or the beach and not running out of that good stuff that keeps you cool and tastes good. Wish I could give this stuff 6 stars.",positive
254,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Gatorade Thirst Quencher Powder,$9.98 - $34.99,5,"This is probably my 3rd order and usually I would switch the flavors around. This is my first time trying the glacier cherry despite not being a fan of cherry flavored drinks but I took a chance and loved it so much that it's easily my favorite flavor now. When mixed, it is a clear liquid, similar to water so no stains if it spills. I recommend watering it down for best taste and less sugar intake. For my 72oz water bottle with less than quarter ice, I would do 1 full scoop plus less than a quarter more.

THE TASTE: the taste isn't too strong and doesn't quite taste like 100% cherry. There's a hint of pomegranate and fruit punch which is very refreshing especially on a hot day. Give it a try, I'm sure you will like it too. I will definitely buy again.",positive
255,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Gatorade Thirst Quencher Powder,$9.98 - $34.99,5,"My mom and I use these as our regular juice intake, as opposed to buying cases of the plastic bottles or other gallon juices.

257,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Gatorade Thirst Quencher Powder,$9.98 - $34.99,5,"I'm glad I found this in bulk (cheaper that way) and I am SO glad I found a version (""glacier cherry"") without artificial color. I like this flavor the best of the various versions of Gatorade I have sampled. Gatorade is a good thing to have around the house, not just for rehydration after exercise, but also for rehydration after GI upset or GI illness, and sometimes it even helps with headaches. One tip for preparing it, though...at full strength it does not dissolve fully in ice water, so I dissolve it in room-temperature water first, then refrigerate it or add ice cubes.",positive

They were OOS, so I used Amazon who graciously sent ir within 4 hours the first time. It was stolen, having been left in the wrong place. I called, got a promis of a refund, advised to Reorder.
I reordered, it was delivered overnight, thank you, but it's not even close to what I ordered and although can't Return it, I was issued a full refund. I'm left holding the ball about disposal.
And need to waste more time, today, trying to find a Seller who knows the difference between a Latte and nit Latte, who can read ""Toasted Graham"" vs. Cinnamon Dulce, who has clean, Starbucks Box, not an obviously recycled Seattle's Best box.

261,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Starbucks K-Cup Coffee Pods,$33.24 - $109.99,5,"In an earlier review for this flavored coffee, I slammed Starbucks. That coffee (Creme Brule'e or at least called that) was awful. While it did smell like Creme Brulee giving the home a pleasant aroma throughout, it gave the pallet anything but that.
THIS Creme Brulee coffee is what Starbucks should have made in the first place! The flavor is real! It passed both the nose and the pallet tests. Sure, it costs more and this time I don't mind the cost. At last I can drink this flavored coffee without the Creme Brulee flavored creamer whereas in the earlier blend, it was a must! I noticed that when I did put the Creme Brulee creamer in this particular blend I didn't have to put much in to enhance the flavor but truthfully, since I normally drink coffee black to begin with, I'm liking this new and exciting blend much better without it.

I just hope Starbuck's will make it available again by the time my supply runs out. It's a great subtle flavour, nothing over-powering, and it's seldom that one cup isn't followed quickly by another.

270,Grocery & Gourmet Food,VPX Bang Energy Drink with Super Creatine,$19.99 - $72.74,5,"In years past when I was working early morning jobs and etc, I had tried several so called ""energy drinks"" like monster, rockstar, etc. None of which helped me at all, and the flavors of all but one weren't any good either.

Fast forward to feb 2019, I had a severe head injury. Long story short, Forklift driver had a steel beam caught on a steel rack and it was under pressure. The beam shot out and struck me in the right side of my head. Ended up with multiple long term issues from this, of which I still deal with. Among some other major issues, I also have memory lapses, concentration, focus, and a couple other cognitive things.
Six months later, due to some of these issues, I wasn't thinking clearly one day and ended up breaking my leg. Had to have two surgeries, steel plates, etc to try to fix it.

Fast forward to about 5 months ago, almost a year and half from when I broke my leg. I still was having a lot pain from my leg, and limped all any time I was up, even had pain when I was sitting or laying down most of the time. Sometimes the pain was so bad, I couldn't hardly put any weight on that leg. And I was also still dealing with the same issues from my head injury.

One day I went with someone to the store, and I was really fatigued, as I had been for some months. Doctor told me that was likely due to the head injury itself, and also the medications I have to take now. In any case, I happened to walk by a end cap in the store with this energy drink I had never heard of before called ""Bang"". I glanced at it, and mostly because I needed a break from trying to walk with the cart, I picked up one can and looked at the ingredients. I didn't find what I expected, seemed to be a much more natural drink that all the one's I had tried before. They had a fruit pump type flavor, and I figured if nothing else might be better than soda. I picked up two cans.
The next day I drink one can over the course of several hours. That evening I realized that I was having a ""really good"" day with my leg. The pain was significantly less than I had been dealing with most days. Didn't think much more of it at the time. Next day I drink the 2nd can over several hours, I had to admit my energy was noticeably improved. Then that evening I also realized I hadn't been limping for several hours. But the next day the pain began to return, and by that evening it had went back to what had become the ""new normal"".
I started thinking about what had changed, was there anything I did different for those two days? The drink... but how could that help my leg...? Week or two passed, and then I went to town again, I found out the store was getting rid of Bang...figures.... But I was able to buy about a case on ""clearance"".
That week I drank one can each day over the course of 3 to 4 hours, and my the pain in my leg was Much Improved. And the brain fog was a lot better, I could think more clearly. I also wasn't fatigued like I had been. It was the best I had felt in 2 years. Couldn't believe that a drink could make that much difference.

I eventually figured out the CoQ10 was what was helping my leg, and I now take a daily supplement. Still have pain at times, but also have times where the pain is gone or nearly gone. Still have a bad day when I'm on my feet alot. So after I couldn't buy it locally, I searched Amazon and found Bang here. So I now have a subscribed shipment for several flavors each month. And I drink one can almost everyday. Its helped me feel much closer to my ""normal"" before my injuries. And by regaining my movement and increased energy, I lost the weight I had put on in the previous year and half.

IF you're going to buy an energy drink, this is the ONLY one that I could recommend. It does Really Work on many levels.
And for people saying their case came beat up or etc. Yeah I've had a few cans come that way too. But none that were broke or leaking. And in the end... it is called Bang :-)

UPDATE: Jan 10th 2022 - Still drink Bang, often one a day. Still helps my injury related problems. One thing has changed... I have now had multiple cases that had been beaten up so bad they were leaking. Amazon really does need to pack these better, and no more than two cases in a box at most.

I've also had a number of cases that ""went missing"" during shipping, and for some 'odd' reason it is Always this Fruit Punch flavor. Apparently someone working in shipping likes fruit punch.

Anyway, a few days ago I had a new problem I hadn't see yet, had 3 cases that came in at the same time which were packed into ONE box :-/ .... which apparently had *Frozen* during shipping and exploded... and then thawed back out. At least that the best theory I have. The box literally fell apart as the UPS guy was handing it to me. In any case, I submitted a return with amazon and got a refund. So even with the issues and such, I can say that Amazon has stood behind their return policy. So long as this continues, I'll keep them on subscription.",positive
271,Grocery & Gourmet Food,VPX Bang Energy Drink with Super Creatine,$19.99 - $72.74,5,"So I took a leap of faith based off of previous reviews, I wasn't sure I would care for anything that was sugar free and I don't care for the aftertaste most energy drinks leave behind. But I had some extra funds on my EBT card and decided to give this a try. First off, the taste was very yummy! Not overly, sickly sweet, it had the perfect balance for a flavor that is Cotton Candy flavored. Usually I can't stand sweetened drinks that are zero sugar, they usually have a strong artificial aftertaste that makes me nauseous but not this one! It also doesn't have that strong energy drink taste to it that leaves a gross aftertaste, which was nice. It gives a nice boost to my energy without feeling jittery or that my heart is going to explode out of my chest. If you are on the fence, I would say just go for it!",positive
272,Grocery & Gourmet Food,VPX Bang Energy Drink with Super Creatine,$19.99 - $72.74,5,"Rainbow Unicorn: I thought this would be great from the name. I mean, it's an awesome name! I expected great things, but I was disappointed. Not enough pizzazz to justify the name. It was a sweet, indistinctly fruity flavor that I didn't especially care for.

Radical Skadattle: Ok this is more what I was looking for! This one could have taken the Rainbow Unicorn name, imho. As the name implies, it's sort of a rainbow Skittles type flavor, with a nice tang to it. Love this flavor.

Sour Heads: This is another winner, I love sour candy, and this is a good one. It's not insanely mouthwateringly sour (I kind of wish it was), but it packs a decent pucker.

Bonus review (Reign flavors): I know this is for Bang, but to me they are more or less interchangeable depending what flavor I want. I have tried and liked Reign's: Jalapeño Strawberry (it's not really spicy, but it's different and fun), Orange Dreamsicle (just like the Creamsicle pops, or an orange creme soda, it's GOOD). Lastly, White Gummy Bear (Pineapple) is good, but not 10/10, more like 8/10, I definitely like it, but I get bored drinking just this one over and over.",positive
273,Grocery & Gourmet Food,VPX Bang Energy Drink with Super Creatine,$19.99 - $72.74,4,"It's hard to describe this flavor, other than being a complex but smoothly executed mix of a rainbow of flavors.

My guess and attempt at describing the flavors would be: Hints of tropical fruits (notably pineaple, maybe a bit of banana?), mixed in with subtle berry flavors (I'm thinking a little strawberry, maybe raspberry and/or blueberry).

Energy additives don't seem overly strong or overpowering - you can't even taste it, as compared to most other 'mainatream' big brand drinks, which have a strong (bordering on harsh and unpleasant) sour taste that seems to come inherently from their choice of energy additives.

Whatever the mix is, this flavor and the fact that it's sugar-free, makes this the favorite go-to that my wife and I buy and drink constantly.",positive

Throughout the years I have definitely come across a few cases that do taste a bit off almost chemically, but I don’t think that’s by design probably just a QC issue. The price has gone up a few bucks since I started ordering cases off of Amazon. I will continue to order bulk as long as the price competes or beats local prices.",positive

Perfect at restaurants with meals. Portion size is good for 2yo or younger. Mine eats two. Loves the flavor. I don't think there's only she doesn't like. I have tried almost all the flavors with her. No added frustose corn syrup and no gmos. Vegan friendly. Gluten free. I loves that this brand has expanded their line to yogurts and puddings.
Again, my daughter loves those too.

This product was a game changer for me over a year ago, and I would hate to have to start searching for another sugar substitute that has zero glycemic impact, has zero calories, has zero carbs, and tastes just like sugar. Thanks so much, Lakanto!

************************************************************************

I buy this stuff all the time. It was a game changer for me. I highly recommend this to people diabetics with a sweet tooth, or keto beginners with a sweet tooth (I'm the latter).

It’s sweetens just like sugar! This maintains a low glycemic index so I don’t have any sugar spikes. I think the price may be a little high. That is the only negative that I have for this product. However, for me, I am willing to pay the little extra for the taste and health benefit.",positive
302,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Lakanto Monk Fruit Sweetener - Sugar Substitute,$3.78 - $77.90,4,"The baking sweetener dissolved easily into the other ingredients. The texture of the dish was unchanged by the substitution. It was a substitution that worked well. Best of all, the sugar rush and crash didn't happen with this dessert. It was a novel experience. No aftertaste like Stevia, no dangerous chemicals like other added sweeteners. I couldn’t be happier with the taste and knowledge that it is good for my health. Research it. If this was 100% Monk Fruit, it would cost a fortune. This is perfect and the reason I am using it daily and will be buying it the rest of my life. Mixing erythritol with monk fruit reduces the cooling sensation and makes for nicer tasting goodies. I've used it mainly for keto baking. Among the things I've made with it are cheesecakes, crumbles, cookies, raspberry jam with chia and BBQ sauce. Many of my sugar loving friends haven't been able to tell it's not sugar. Erythritol doesn't dissolve very well, so if you want a smooth consistency grind the sweetener in a (very dry) coffee grinder or food processor until it's a powder. It may seem expensive but a little goes a long way if you're no longer used to very sweet things.",positive
303,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Lakanto Monk Fruit Sweetener - Sugar Substitute,$3.78 - $77.90,5,"This product is an excellent sugar substitute for baking cakes and cookies. One thing to note about erythritol is that it can cause gastric discomfort if too much is consumed, since your body does not metabolize it. I have some recipes that call for a lot of sugar that I reduce the amount of erythritol needed by adding pure stevia to the recipe. Another thing about erythritol - I don't like it for making liquid things like compotes, curds, ice cream, etc, because it will recrystallize in a few days and ruin the texture. For liquid things, I prefer allulose (however, I had bad luck baking with allulose - it tends to burn and also changed the texture of the baked goods - I will have to experiment more.)",positive

305,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Lakanto Monk Fruit Sweetener - Sugar Substitute,$3.78 - $77.90,5,"We love this in our house. I cook a lot of sugar free and keto recipes.. (You would not believe the amount of desserts that you can make that taste FANTASTIC that are good for you without any bad for you sugars.) This is best tasting sugar substitute we have found. Of course, we would love this to be as affordable as sugar, but that is probably not a reasonable price.

Advice for others who want to try this...
Golden monkfruit is better than the original.
If you want to bake with this, it does contain Erythritol, which can crystallize when exposed to heat (depending on what you are making). This can be fantastic for some textures, but terrible for others. You can powder it with a mill grinder (which is what we do), which then doesn't have the same issue. It is well worth it. You may need a tad more when it is powdered. If price is not an issue for you, this company makes a baking sweetener as well. I haven't used that much to comment on its flavor profile.

I would highly recommend trying this sweetener if you are looking to eat healthier without having to sacrifice flavor.",positive

So I recreated an old recipe for coffee-flavored (or plain) tapioca pudding from a vintage recipe card for the Instant Pot | multicooker, using this Lankato monkfruit sugar substitute. It’s a weekly treat now and great for anyone who must watch sugar intake.

NOTE: If you get a burn notice, just use a flat-edge wooden spatula to scrape it up, stir in 1/4 cup more water, and reset. It doesn’t burn, exactly? but rather sticks the bottom of the SS liner.

Dr. Lauren’s Instant Pot Tapioca Pudding

INGREDIENTS:
2 cups water *OR coffee*
½ cup tapioca pearls (not quick-cooking)
½ cup Lankato monkfruit sugar substitute
pinch of salt
2 egg yolks, room temperature
½ cup half and half OR non-dairy substitute
1 teaspoon vanilla extract, more to taste

INSTANT POT | MULTICOOKER DIRECTIONS:
Mix tapioca and water *OR coffee* inside your Instant Pot.

Cook at high pressure for 7 minutes.

When cooking time is complete, wait for a natural pressure release for 10 minutes, then do a quick release of any remaining pressure.

Add sugar, a pinch of salt and stir slowly.

In a small bowl, whisk egg yolks and half and half. Slowly pour the mixture into the Instant Pot, while stirring constantly. Add vanilla extract and stir well.

Select “Sauté” and cook until it starts to reach a slow bubbling simmer (not a full boil). Press ""cancel"" at that point and remove Instant Pot liner to a raised rack or trivet to cool.

Serve warm or chilled and enjoy.

It’d be great made with cocoa powder, or some interesting baking flavor extracts found right here. Search for the Bakto store; they offer 60 choices and you can customize a 3- or 5-flavor custom mix. Chai or another spicy tea, even Earl Grey or matcha, maybe even clear fruit juice, would all be interesting variations (reduce the monkfruit sugar to ~1/3 cup, or tone down with plain or Grewk yogurt. For kids, stir in your choice of baking chips after the pudding has cooled to near room temperature. If you don’t want to taste the little tapioca pearls, simply cook this on High Pressure for 10 minutes—obliterates them lol. I might have to try this with some boba pearls cooked much longer.",positive

One can had already leaked out and was empty (not that I would have drunk any of it anyway) and the lids of three cans were severely dented, one so badly that it sprayed all over me by the time I had wrestled it open. This purchase did not result in the savings or value I had hoped to gain by it.""

However, on my second delivery, the box was undamaged, explaining the excellent shape of the cans, and a second box of Citrus Twist similarly arrived in excellent condition.

As previously mentioned, I love ICE Black Raspberry + Caffeine - it's my favorite ""sparkling water"" now, although it's ultimately a 5-calorie soft drink because the carbonation is added. (Just FYI, this flavor is offered in bottles without caffeine, but I want the extra kick of caffeine included with the cans.)

Unlike any ""soft drink"" or ""sparkling water"" of which I'm aware, ICE + Caffeine drinks include 15% of the RDA of Vitamins A, D, B6, Niacin, B12, Biotin and Pantothenic Acid in addition to 70 mg of caffeine, so they also qualify as an Energy drink.

Every guest I've had chooses ICE Black Raspberry + Caffeine over anything else I have, including Pepsi, hot and frozen coffee and fruit juices, including my diabetic friend who must necessarily avoid sugary drinks.

Trust me on this one: you will love this flavor and purchasing it in the amount Amazon offers provides a minimum 25% savings over grocery stores prices where it is frequently unavailable and only sold on a per can basis at (currently) $1.75+ per can. Now I only purchase one or two cans of different flavors to find out whether or not I like them enough to purchase 12 to 24 by scheduled deliveries on Amazon, but no other flavors compare to this, and no other carbonated beverages offer the B vitamins and caffeine that promote energy.

If you have been looking for something new that tastes great that you can enjoy if you're trying to cut calories or just want something delicious, refreshing and energizing to drink, ICE Black Raspberry+Caffeine should be at the top of your list.",positive

I am a bonafide soda addict; I can’t get enough of the stuff. If they could give me Cheerwine intravenously, and pump it straight into my blood stream 24 hours a day, I would be cool with that. But I also know how bad all that sugar is for your health and your teeth. I’m not saying artificial sweetener is better, but it feels like the lesser of the two evils. I digress. These scratch the soda itch for me without all that sugar. I have tried several of the flavors, and will break down my thoughts on each flavor below:

Blue Raspberry: This is the best flavor by FAR! It is candy-like, but in a tart and refreshing way. It isn’t overly sweet at all. Just delicious!

Strawberry Citrus: This doesn’t taste like limes, oranges, or strawberries (the fruits pictured on the can) to me, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t good. It’s a vague fruity flavor, but not in a bad way. It still blows my dress up, just not as much as the Blue Raspberry one.

UPDATE: Orange Passion Fruit: This one is really good! It is very tangy and more passion fruit than orange to my tastebuds. It has a very zesty, zingy tropical flavor. Me likey!

Citrus Twist: This one is kinda “meh” but kinda good if you’re REALLY thirsty, because it is tangy and refreshing. It has grown on me as I’ve worked my way through the case, but I am undecided as to whether I will purchase it again. It tastes like Mountain Dew and Sprite had a baby, and has an aftertaste similar to diet Mountain Dew (if you know, you know).

None of these have the nasty, “want to scrub your tongue” aftertaste that some drinks containing artificial sweetener have. The sweetener in these is sucralose, which from my experience, isn’t as bad for that. I will update my ranking as I try other flavors. I have an unopened case of the Orange Passion Fruit at home, and am considering purchasing the Cherry Vanilla.",positive

320,Grocery & Gourmet Food,REIGN Fitness & Performance Drink,$18.98 - $49.95,4,"When it comes to getting my morning caffeine, I can choke down just about anything. I’ve even managed to consume pure caffeine, which is nasty, awful stuff. This gummi bear flavored concoction really pressed me to my limits, though. The taste is absolutely, positively vile. I’ve been drinking energy drinks since I had my first can on Red Bull in the late 1990’s. I’ve tried just about every variation that’s come out since then. Reign Total Body Fuel, white gummi bear flavor easily ranks among the very worst I’ve ever tried. The basic flavor is as horrible as it is indescribable. It has a wretched chemical tang, very strong artificial sugar flavor, and an aftertaste that is brutally punishing.

Then why did I give this product four stars instead of one? Because those who truly appreciate the miracle that is the modern energy drink do not worry about flavor any more than a connoisseur of fine Cognac worries about the shape of the bottle. It’s all about chasing the dragon, and that dragon is caffeine. This product gives 300 mg of pure, uncut white lightning per 16 oz can, which is among the very highest available on the American market. That is the same amount of caffeine you would get from three cups of coffee or an entire six-pack of Coke. If that doesn’t wake you up in the morning, my friends, you are probably actually dead.

So, yes, just like the thrill of standing on the summit Mount Everest, you have to earn the rush you get from Reign Total Body fuel. The price you pay comes from the awful, awful flavor, a offering of suffering in exchange for earthly pleasure. And just like climbing Everest, many will not be up to the challenge. They will fall by the wayside after their first sip, left to get their fix from a cup of green tea. But for those who are willing to push through the pain, the rewards are great and beautiful.

Edited to add: I have also now tried the Orange Dreamsicle flavor. Calories: 10 Caffeine: 300 mg

340,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Peet’s Coffee,$38.18 - $97.90,5,"I originally tried Peet's coffee (medium roast, Big Bang) via an influenser thing, and was impressed by how bold it was for a medium roast. I really enjoyed it. My preference is dark roast coffee, black, unsweetened.. the darker the better. I want it bold, smooth, and chewy. I figured if Peet's can make a gorgeous dark leaning medium, then I must try one of their actual dark roasts. So I came here to find some. This is good! It is strong for a K-cup. I usually brew k-cups at 8 ounces for best flavor, but this can be easily brewed at 10 ounces. Try 6 ounces for extra bite, or for pouring over ice. I intend to try their other dark roasts, and even their decaf (occasionally I still want coffee but dont want the caffeine). This Major Dickason's Blend has a little something I can't quite pinpoint. It has a hint of tang that I normally avoid, yet that deep undertone of dark roasts keeps it solidly in my favor. I really like this, but it is maybe #2 or 3 in my list of preferred coffee, but it is on the list of coffee I would repurchase!. I see that they also offer other dark roasts, so I will be sure to try them out. My usual dark roasts are:
San Fransisco Bay Extra Dark Italian Roast
Green Mountain Dark Magic

As for others in my household, my husband drank some and he is more of a Caribou medium or light roast drinker (blegh). I had my mom over for coffee, and I made this for her. She never knows what I am making, but usually it is a medum or dark roast. She definitely noticed that this was different and very good. She thought it had a good strong coffee flavor. She added a little cream and sugar.

I'm pleased. My box of loose cups is exactly as expected. No problems, no issues, no concerns. Will highly likely buy again.",positive

Those are my top 3 in order of all time favorite K-cups. I prefer darker more robust blends so if dark roast isn’t up your alley then steer back to Caribou Day Break light blend. If you’re enjoying medium blends but just craving something a bit more then I recommend you take the plunge and try this. Packaging was well done so please don’t listen to these bad reviews. This is the same thing you’d get in the store. The kcups have the bulge aka the vacuum sealed air right seal unlike people posting pictures of them flat or deflated looking.

364,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Maruchan Ramen,$5.76 - $36.99,5,"I'm a retired single guy with simple tastes, and a predilection for pasta. I like ramen because one package is just the right size for a meal, and hey, it's pasta. I do do a little tinkering with the basic meal. I found some dried vegetable flakes here on Amazon, and add a heaping tablespoon to the water. It adds a little color and flavor, and the flakes help me see when the water is boiling. I also add a dollop of stir-fry sauce or General Tso's sauce to add a little extra flavor. Oh, and I drain most of the water off before adding the seasoning packet and the dollop of sauce, mix everything in well, then drain the rest of the water off.

Being on a fixed pension, the cost per envelope is very attractive. Even with my additions I figure a meal costs me less than fifty cents. If one were to add frozen vegatables instead of dried flakes the price might be a few cents more, but still more than satisfactory to one's budget.",positive

I don’t make mine according to the instructions, for 2 reasons: I don’t like styrofoam, and I prefer to use more water than the cup would hold, because I love the broth. So I dump the contents of the cup into a soup mug, which is tricky, as the noodles are somehow stuck to the cup. I hold the cup over my mug, then gently squeeze the cup with both hands as I rotate the cup to release all the noodles. This keeps the styrofoam from breaking/cracking, and after one full rotation, the clump of noodles plops into my mug. Then I add 12-14oz of boiling water, and cover for 3 minutes as stated in the directions. After I finish drinking the broth, I add 1/4 cup of chopped cashews to the noodles. Yum!

410,Grocery & Gourmet Food,BODYARMOR LYTE Sports Drink Low-Calorie Sports Beverage,$14.88 - $49.77,5,"PROS: This is SO delicious. You'd never know it has very little sugar (thanks to the wonderful, natural sugar substitute, erythritol). The peach flavor is dominant in the peach-mango, but that's what I was hoping for. A little reminiscent of peach tea. It's not overly sweet like a lot of items like this, either (although I wouldn't mind if it was slightly less sweet - but it doesn't have that gross overly sweet Stevia flavor like so many items out there).
CONS: My only complaint is the form factor. Maybe it would be impossible to offer a dehydrated/powdered form, but I would greatly appreciate if they did, for environmental reasons. While this is great for on-the-go or when you can't prep in advance, it's still bulky plastic, and so I don't drink them nearly as often as I would otherwise. (Yes, there is recycling where I live, but a lot of the plastics that go into recycling don't actually end up being recycled.)

FLAVORS: I have only tried a couple of other flavors - the tropical coconut (pineapple + coconut) was fine but just not my preference (you might like it if you're a big fan of pina coladas). The first one I tried was the Berry Punch flavor, and it was definitely good enough to get my attention as a natural, low-sugar electrolyte version. Quite good, but the Peach Mango is by far the best, IMHO. The Berry Punch is a little less sweet, though, which is nice; I'm just partial to peach. I do still want to try other flavors, but there doesn't seem to be an affordable variety pack on here. I was able to find some flavors in the store, but they were pretty pricey each compared to the bulk pack here.

I have tried a LOT of lower or no-sugar electrolyte products over time, as well as Pedialyte (the Advanced Care version), my prior go-to, which isn't too terrible in terms of sugar content. The Pedialyte is still the most effective per dose that I've tried. However, this gets me most of the way there and with no artificial colors, a lot less sugar, and cheaper per ounce. So I think I can finally stop feeling like a child and drinking Pedialyte when I feel a migraine coming on or am just too dehydrated, lol, thanks to this product. Definitely going on the subscribe & save rotation!",positive
411,Grocery & Gourmet Food,BODYARMOR LYTE Sports Drink Low-Calorie Sports Beverage,$14.88 - $49.77,5,"I’m no expert on sports drinks so I can’t really speak to the ingredients or compare them to other similar products but like so many others, I struggle to drink as much water as recommended and know that I feel much better in every way when I can stay hydrated. My son turned me on to Body Armor and I thought it was delicious. I love sugary drinks and Coca Cola is my guilty pleasure. I drink quite a bit of it despite knowing that it is terrible for me in several ways. I started out with the regular flavors but decided to try the Lyte variety because they have almost no calories for the entire bottle. I can down on of these puppies in a few minutes where it takes me an hour to nurse a bottle of plain water. I’m no athlete but I do work out and these drinks are great at quenching thirst and I’m hoping that the ingredients are replenishing to my body. The Peach Mango is my favorite flavor but honestly I have not found one that I don’t like! Even better, they are reasonably priced on Amazon and cheaper than they are at my local grocery store even when they are on sale. I hesitate to post this glowing review because I don’t want to run out if everyone runs to snap them up. I have the PM flavor on auto-delivery and last night, after reading a bunch of reviews, ordered a few more flavors to have on hand for variety. With Body Armor Lyte I have a beverage that keeps me able to drink the recommended amount of fluid daily while not feeling guilty for the empty calories or spending a fortune. I am a huge fan of this product. I hope they never stop making it and that Amazon continues to make it available at an affordable price.

UPDATE: I just got my shipment of the Coconut flavor and if it’s possible I like it even BETTER than the Peach Mango and I haven’t even tried the Strawberry Lemonade yet. Someone had said these were 40 calories a bottle but it looks to me like there is only one serving per bottle making them only 20 calories for the whole bottle Either way a winner in my book.

420,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Victor Allen's Coffee Donut Shop Blend Coffee Pods for Keurig K-Cup Brewers,$18.18 - $119.88,4,"Once and a while I will shop around and try news things. Coffee is something, when a brand is consistent, you stick with especially if you tried a bunch and fell upon a favorite; no reason to change it. The only reason that I tried this brand was fluctuating pricing in my favorite but that has since settled down back to the value it should be.

During that inflation in pricing I tried this brand. Not bad but not better than Amazon's Solimo Dark Roast. I have tried to beat it on price and taste but do not believe it's possible. I'll stay with Solimo and willing to absorb small increases as long as price normalizes over time. Solimo Dark Roast is surprisingly good. Do not pay more on others, no reason to, they will not taste better. Use 6, 7, 8 ounces water maximum for best results. I combine 2 k-cups in two brew cycles to make one larger 12+ ounce cup of coffee.",positive

I know that probably sounds weird, but some brands paper filters are very difficult to pull out and others even have an additional plastic filter in addition to the paper one.

I originally got a Keurig for the purpose of limiting myself to one or two cups in the morning due to blood pressure issues. It kept me from drinking a whole pot of coffee! Then I got hooked on all the little different flavors, but there's no way I'm going to pay a dollar or more per cup of coffee in my own home. So I'll probably buy them only when I can get them dirt cheap or at least a bargain price. These were flavorful and work well. Some Victor Allen K-Cups don't have a strong enough flavor for me but the answer to that is is just make a smaller cup. I don't make it to the bottom of one of those giant cups of coffee anyway and I like my coffee hot. If you can get 80 K-Cups for around $20 or so these days you didn't do too bad, but as I said too many K-Cups are priced astronomically these days and I'll pass on those and break out the old coffee pot if I have to!",positive

435,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Victor Allen's Coffee Favorites Variety Pack,$20.59 - $77.18,4,"no real issues with box i received. All flavors smell heavenly when being brewed, especially the chocolate hazelnut. Individual flavor taste wise all seems a little weak to my tastebuds even though coffee taste itself is actually on strong side even when using 12oz of water (in instant pod solo maker) BUT, when i add one drop of ezsweetz (pure liquid sulcralose) the flavor profile really pops out (something liquid sulcralose is good at doing without leaving an aftertaste). I do find the need to add tbsp of sugar to mine, keto-ish sugar that is (purecane zero calories one) and i drink it black 95% of the time but, on occasion i add a splash of milk when my carb intake has been low, these are even yummier that way. Glad i choose these, was never a flavored coffee person, only got the pod coffee maker for making flavored tea but, decided to try these too when i bought maker since the flavor choices of these seemed pretty good, was a good choice..

minor issues:
-i’ve tried one pod from each flavor yesterday (when received), after taking them all out of box today, it shows there are 2 pods missing in box i received; one chocolate hazelnut and one peanut butter cup.
-I also don’t care for how they just throw all the pods mixed together into the product box, not very nice presentation really but, overall i’m happy with purchase..

438,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Victor Allen's Coffee Favorites Variety Pack,$20.59 - $77.18,3,"Like a lot of other shoppers, I was trying to find decent flavored coffee pods at a good price. Also, like a lot of others, I was interested in a peppermint flavored coffee, and this variety pack offered one without demanding an arm and a leg in trade (*ahem* Starbucks, Dunkin). I really happen to like cinnamon in my coffee, too, so the Cinnamon Bun flavor seemed promising and I was excited to try it.

Firstly, I can understand why some reviewers claim there is ""no flavor"" to these; the flavoring that is there is not overpoweringly, punch-in-the-face strong--which I think some people need/expect. I'm not one of those people, however, and could easily taste the Peppermint Bark and Vanilla Buttercream, with the Sugar Cookie being a little more subtle. As for Cinnamon Bun... well, that's another story I'll get to in a bit. All the coffee itself claims to be medium roast, but I'd be shocked if it were actually anything beyond a light roast. If you like strong coffee, this is not for you, especially in this k-cup format. Oh, and there was a weird smell coming from the printed foil lids, especially after heated from brewing... maybe the ink used? Thankfully not the coffee itself, but still a little off-putting (though not really noticeable with the Peppermint Bark pods, for some reason).

Anyway, breaking this pack down by flavor, I'll go from my favorite to least-favorite:

- Peppermint Bark: 4/5 stars. The flavor was there for me, but as I said earlier, not overly strong. But if I wanted overly strong, I'd pour peppermint schnapps into my regular coffee and be done with it. This is a softer peppermint, like you've stirred your coffee with a candy cane; enough to be appreciable and enjoyable (and you can really smell it as it's brewing). 1 star off because I'd prefer a stronger roast on the coffee, and just a *bit* more flavoring would be nice. I would buy this flavor again, on its own, though.

- Vanilla Buttercream: 4/5 stars. This one (pleasantly) surprised me. Vanilla flavors can easily get lost, and that's what I expected from this and the Sugar Cookie. But there is a rich, actual butter flavor/aroma to this that I really liked in addition to the vanilla. Again, flavor and coffee roast could be a little stronger, for my preference, so 1 star off.

- Sugar Cookie: 3/5 stars. Honestly, what I got from this one is only slightly better than what I expected. Sugar cookie is such a subtle flavor to begin with, that paired with (what I truly believe to be) a light roast coffee, it was surprising to be able to taste the flavor at all--but I could. Somewhat. That said, it really only amounted to an average cup of coffee with a hint of cookie taste from time to time.

- Cinnamon Bun: 0/5 stars. This one was unbelievably disappointing. No cinnamon flavor, whatsoever. Hell, there wasn't even any COFFEE flavor. The only possible way this could remind me of a cinnamon bun is if I scraped the icing off and mixed it with a copious amount of hot water.... It was seriously like hot sugar-water, but somehow without the sugar. Even with generous amounts of creamer and sweetener added, this one was unpalatable to me and I could not finish the cup. I really can't see saving the remainder of these pods in the back of my coffee drawer, ""just in case"", as it didn't even give me a plain old cup of coffee--will likely just throw them out.

Overall, I wouldn't buy this variety pack again, though I would purchase the Peppermint Bark flavor individually. Vanilla Buttercream might be worth buying individually, as well, if that's a flavor profile you like. Both had enough, good flavor for me to enjoy my cups of coffee. The other two flavors, though, were average at best, and horribly disgusting at worst--making half the variety pack a waste of money, for me, even though it is decently priced.",fair

I'm not using this brand for the flavor- purely the dental benefits, and it does leave my breath feeling clean, so for me it's working as intended. Wasn't expecting a long lasting flavor, but it would have been nice",positive
461,Grocery & Gourmet Food,PUR GUM BAGS,$3.28 - $75.25,4,"The gum is decent, if you want sugar free and this new special chemical they use to sweeten it.

I shared it with my medical team chemo nurse ms. Brenda. I call her ms.”B”. She’s a blast when I come in for chemo. I do blood weekly, last week was the 1st in 3 years I was able to take 1 week off treatments, blood/ pre meds. so I don’t get sick. That was wonderful.
She makes me feel happy when I’m down, she knows how to give me tips on when I’m not feeling well. She just became a new grandmother for the 1st time. I love my medical team. But she stands out !!! I forgot to say she loved this gum too.
Love her 💕

468,Grocery & Gourmet Food,PUR GUM BAGS,$3.28 - $75.25,4,"At the suggestion of my dentist and PCP, I purchased these because xylitol helps increase saliva production. I have autoimmune disorders, and I take medications which lower my saliva and tear production. Saliva is important for dental health as it lowers the amount of bacterial growth in the mouth, therefore lowering the chances of cavities, gingivitis, bad breath, etc.

Though the flavor does not last long on some flavors, maybe 10 min or so, this gum is great for saliva production. It still stimulated my salivary glands even after it had lost most of its flavor.

I've not yet tried all of the flavors, but I will try to update this review once I have.

Pomegranate Mint: 5/5. I didn't think I would like this flavor, but the tartness of the pomegranate mixes nicely with the cooling mint. It freshens the breath, despite the flavor not lasting long. The scent lasts longer than the flavor, and my husband said he could smell it on my breath even though I'd been chewing it for longer than an hour. I enjoy it a lot.

Wintergreen: 4/5. The flavor lasts much longer on this than the Pomegranate Mint. It is also much stronger, so it will freshen more potent breath than the pomegranate flavor. This is one you can use after eating garlic, onions, etc. I give it a 4/5 because flavors that include the words ""winter,"" ""polar,"" etc. are not flavors I like a lot.

Bubblegum: 2/5. Tastes like bubblegum and flavor lasts as long as the bubblegum one chews as a kid, which is not very long. The flavor isn't bad, and there isn't really an aftertaste like childhood bubblegum. The flavor just doesn't last more than 10 min or so.

Cinnamon: 5/5. Very intense flavor, like one expects from cinnamon flavored gum. This flavor lasted longer than the Wintergreen, and was just as potent for bad breath. I could chew it for several hours and still taste cinnamon. If you like cinnamon, this is a great choice.

Chocolate Mint: 3/5. I can't quite place what kind of mint it is. It's like a mix of spearmint and peppermint. It reminds me of a peppermint patty. The taste is not long lasting (though longer than the bubblegum), and I don't think it would be great for freshening breath. However, it does taste good and increase saliva production.",positive
469,Grocery & Gourmet Food,PUR GUM BAGS,$3.28 - $75.25,4,"These are great! And good for your teeth, but I wish The flavor didn’t run out so quickly! After about 8-10 min you loose most of the flavor.

They are a healthy addition and it doesn't take that much.
So far, mine have only contained seeds. I hope others just got a bad batch.
I will keep buying them but look carefully.
I hate bugs and how dirt was in a container I don't know. I hope the company addressed those issues. If those customers contacted the company and posted their replies it would be nice. I have been using these about a year and so far not had issues myself.

There's no bugs or twigs, just the usual static electricity that makes Chia Seeds act like mini Mexican Jumping Beans. :-) As I filled the jar in which I store a smaller portion because my pantry's on the small side, I even searched for some brown seeds - the ones that haven't yet matured - and haven't found any. Which says to me that this is a quality batch.

I been eating Chia, Flax and Hemp Seeds every day since 2020 as part of my ""Breakfast of Champions"" (pictured). I use them in smoothies, homemade bread and muffins and other dishes. Glad I found these, because they're a great deal for the price as well.

One thing I might consider changing: the jar could be light- or ultraviolet-proof. The other brand whose jar is a little smaller and in which I store the seeds in my kitchen pantry is that dark green color so the seeds are not exposed to light. This actually is a small thing for me since I will store both containers in cool dark places (this big jar is now down in the ""shopping pantry"" where large, bulk items are kept). And, I guess transparency is a good thing so consumers can see what they're buying.

Anyhoo, great product.",positive
