It's also how I convince my wife of certain things I won't detail here. I dropped it a handful of times the last time I went camping, but that was probably from all the drinking. My hand eye coordination is really good most of the time, and my friend Steve has even remarked about it in the past. Regardless, it did end up falling into rocks/gravel and did end up taking a bit of damage. I would have supplied pictures, but I ended up losing it when I traveled back in time to 1994 because it did not function well as a pog slammer. Oh well, you live and you learn I suppose.",positive

50,Collectible Coins,Whitman Cent Folder Parent,$1.93 - $28.32,4,I bought the set of 3 of these books when I was around 11 years old. I recently unpacked them from storage & decided to try And see how many of the empty slots I could fill for the Specific years of pennies I couldn’t find before. Unfortunately they were falling apart after all these years so I log into Amazon and search Penny collection books and was very surprised to see that they had the very same set after all these years and it was virtually unchanged The cost of each of the three was very reasonable so ordered them right away.It’s a great way to easily see what you have or what you don’t- & The descriptions are informative when it comes to telling you how many of these coins were minted & where from. My only advice is to make sure when you insert the coins that you have the book laying open on a hard surface. If you don’t it will bend easily & make “crease marks” in the cardboard other than that they are great for adults and kids alike. Especially when you have the book open & and see the empty spots naturally it makes you want to fill them. Even my son was very motivated to find pennies we didnt have in our collection & he learned a lot along the way,positive
51,Collectible Coins,Whitman Cent Folder Parent,$1.93 - $28.32,5,I like to be able to add to coin collection as the coins pass through the hands. It is easy to make a list and check change from any store to see what can fill the empty slots.,positive

Decorative Wooden Box with Certificate of Authenticity.",$42.50 - $59.90,4,"This is my second time purchasing from here. I bought the 1lb and enjoyed it enough to purchase the 2lb. My children liked the “treasure chest” the coins came in. There are a good mixture of different sizes, colors, and shapes. Which was neat to look through, however a lot of the coins were from the same area. I would have liked to see a little more of a variety of places. It also has a lot of duplicate coins. I would say some I even have six of the same coin. The 2lb had U.S. pennies and a nickel. The “special coin” each box had was so deteriorated that it was hard to see anything on it. So, overall…I had fun with my kids, but I think it’s a little overpriced for what you get.",positive

63,Collectible Coins,"Padre - World Currency Set - Treasure Chest with 1Lb. Expert-Inspected, Foreign Currency Coin Collection in 4.7 x 3.5 x 3.5 in. Decorative Wooden Box with Certificate of Authenticity.",$42.50 - $59.90,3,"I was very excited to receive this item, considering I’ve always enjoyed collecting foreign money and just recently found out I can buy a variety of different coins on Amazon to add to my collection.

Though the box is nice, I felt it could have been sanded down a bit, got a few splinters by just examining the chest.

Upon pouring out the coins from a baggie that was within the chest I was excited to go through every single coin. However I came up with disappointment as I did not have to go through each coin as a good majority of them are from rather the same country or are of the same type.

Variation of the coins are also pretty lack luster, as all the coins came from the same places in Europe. Over 100 coins and not a single one from Asia. I also found a bus token and 2 arcade tokens. I was really hoping I wouldn’t come across a single token.

Most of the coins were dated around 19th century while maybe a good 4 of them were from the 18th century. I was not all too disappointed with the conditions of these coins as I expected them to be pretty circulated.

I’ll admit, I should’ve have seen this coming, reading the reviews of people experiencing the same thing I should’ve thought this thoroughly before making the purchase.
However, I did obtain coins I have yet in my collection despite the numerous repeats I have of them now. So I suppose the experiencing was not all too bad how ever with the amount of repeats I do not believe charging over $60 is worth the price for variation. I understand that the company picks the coins at random and I wouldn’t be surprised if they just scooped up 2lb worth of coins from a pile and bag it up for shipping.

That may be exact the problem that could be easily fixed for a lot of customers if the company could take the time to ensure there aren’t any duplicates and more variation in each chest before shipping. It would also ensure no tokens were added to the mix, considering the Certificate of Authenticity that came with the chest mentions that “each coin” was examined for authenticity yet tokens managed to make their way into the pile somehow.",fair

For example I got seven 1998 British pennies. There was also a disproportionate amount of Colombian coins, seventeen, which although they varied by dates it really cuts into the overall diversity of the world coins vibe. The oldest date was 1826, but the majority are 1940 and later. Some of the coins were bent, and many so worn it was difficult to tell what they were. One coin I still can’t I.D. The little treasure chest box they come with is where most of the price of this product is probably allocated. It’s not of high quality, but looks nice and makes a nice gift box for the coins. A child interested in coins might love this, however this is not a good buy for someone just looking to acquire a diverse collection of world coins.

89,Collectible Coins,The Penny Journal by Pennybandz Holds 146 Coins The Ultimate Souvenir Penny Collecting Book for Your Coin Collection Holds 128 Pressed Pennies and 18 Pressed Quarters or Nickels,$21.97,3,"There are two plastic penny sheets has 4x4 double sided grid, with two pages you can slide into the center. (64p each)
The journal has enough pages for 18 sets of 16 pennies (288p). Each set has a 4x4 grid to match the penny sheets, and 3 pages of note space, except the last set with only one notes page.

Just got my book in and have been organizing and placing my collection. I picked this one because I liked the idea of being able to add more sheets as I get more pennies and the notebook with it to help chronicle where I got each one. While loading the pennies I kept noticing the sheets slide around making me realize how insecure the pages themselves are since they're only held in by friction with the journal and the elastic strap. The first page advertises itself as a change pocket, but I feel pretty confident any amount of change would cause it to slip out.

Then while logging the pennies I realized the next problem, adding sheets means the pages in my journal will be all out of order since they have to be added to the center. This means I would need to go ahead and commit to getting the extra pages before logging anything into the journal past Penny Page 4 or take out up to 64 pennies to expand the pages.

Finally the journal has enough space to log 288 pennies, but only enough sheets come with it for 128, (plus the bonus sheet for 18 bigger coins) The extra add-in sheets bring in enough for 256 pennies, leaving only 2 extra sets (32p) worth in the journal. This is only enough space if you for some reason made a mistake in the journal and wanted to just start over, but not even close to enough to entertain a third set of add-ins.

Either the journal shouldn't have that much note space, or it should just include the extra two sheets as part of the notebook and NOT advertise itself as expandable. Its just too expensive to have this huge problem that requires me to pay for shipping again to complete the product. The sheets could still be sold as replacements for lost or damaged pages, but with the current layout of the product a second set is just mandatory. Having to pay shipping twice makes this a $40 journal and I don't know if that's really worth it. Ultimately the math came out to about 15 cents per penny if you want to compare the quality to other storage options.

I love my penny collection and was excited for a nice way to store and display them, but this just disappointed me.",fair

These were pretty much what I remembered, with a nice slot to slide each penny. There are larger slots as well -- I've used mine for smashed euros.
I bought the two pack because I figured my middle daughter would want one as well (she did). She doesn't have any smashed pennies of her own, so she got the ""free"" ones that were included. (Those happened to be the Chattanooga choo choo and Legoland.)

111,Collectible Coins,BCW 2x2 Coin Snap Holder Large Dollar (38.1mm) Bundle of 25,$13.71,1,"THE BAD NEWS:

I have been buying BCW coin snaps for almost ten years, in all flavors: penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar and dollar. Once they were great, with nice smooth edges all around, no rough spots or burrs and the top and bottom fit together in a tight tolerance.
4-5 years ago, I started to see the occasional snap with rough plastic spots sticking out along the 4 edges where they come out of the mold, the so-called birth marks.
Last summer I saw this all go to heck. 90% of the snaps in all flavors were coming in with aggressive rough spots of jagged plastic from the mold release points and the top and bottom halves were not fitted to a tight tolerance anymore. The rough spots are so bad, you have to take an x-acto blade to remove these plastic anomalies. Cleaning them up makes them better but of course it will never make them the way they should be which is smooth clear plastic all around the whole perimeter of the snaps. And it is an incredible waste of time and resources to fix them.
I have a wholesale account with BCW and had extended conversations with them about the problem. They acknowledged the problem but 9 months later nothing has changed. The vendor(s) in China that produce these for them are either slow to make new molds or do not want to. They are still bad.

The GOOD NEWS:

Recently, on Amazon there are new listings for 2 inch coin snaps that are not BCW. There isn't a 'brand name' and several vendors are selling them. They are basically Chinese knock offs of the BCW, but BETTER. If you search Amazon for ""coin snaps"" you will find them. The outer and inner dimensions are identical to BCW snaps. BUT better yet, they eliminated that framing area on the top side of the snaps. The result is the viewing area is increased. All the sides are SMOOTH and clear with none of the extreme rough break off points you see in the BCW's. The top and bottom tolerance fit is tight and matched up. The 2 large slots you see on BCW's have been eliminated which also increases smoothness. It can be tricky but once you figure out how to open them, it is fine. There is one corner on these knock off snaps that has a small gap between the top and bottom pieces. With a jeweler's flat head screw driver you can twist and pop them open. Pricing is comparable to what you see for BCW snaps.
If you are frustrated with the continued poor quality if all the BCW snaps, I would try these knock offs. Plus, they are Prime Amazon items, so if for any reason you are not satisfied you can return them for free!",negative

A number of them were quite nice and had sharp details. I didn't rate a 5 since they were rolled in one of those paper rolls as I was expected them in a plastic tube like the wheaties I got a few months ago. Maybe a drawstring bag. Packed in a padded envelope and not a box. However, that is not a big deal since I couldn't put them back in the tube correctly and do not need any more boxes.

405,Collectible Coins,"Different Coins from Many Countries Around The World Including Money Bag, Coin Purse - Pouch",$18.50 - $202.90,5,"Oh yah, they're some different and cool coinage.

There is a lot of different coins from around the world. They are lower denominations of course, for the price, you're not going to get any rare collectables. However they are interesting. Most of them, I have no idea what nations they are from. Many are from South East Asia, like the Philippines and Indonesia, the middle east, and some European countries, and then other countries as well. Since I don't read their language, I couldn't tell you from where most are from. They are old and fairly worn out with use.

I got these to use as currency in a game I'm putting together and thought their exotic and different scripts would be good with the other fantasy coins I bought. I think they'll be great for that purpose, adding a wider range of cultures to the monetary system of my fantasy world. For the price, they were much cheaper than the other metal fantasy and pirate coins out there.

If I had any suggestions for the seller, it would be to have sets from particular regions or countries. Like a Chinese coin set, Japanese, India, Middle Eastern, European, Pacific Islands, etc.. that way, if I wanted to give my game a more Chinese or Japanese mythos type theme, I could have coins from those cultures, adding to it's experience.

For everyone else, I guess you could show off these coins and regale all your friends about the adventures you had across the Asian continent and be ""that guy."" 😉",positive
406,Collectible Coins,"Different Coins from Many Countries Around The World Including Money Bag, Coin Purse - Pouch",$18.50 - $202.90,4,"Not really too bad of a haul.

May not sound like a big deal, but when I buy a certain amount of things, I want that amount. The price I paid was $24.49. If I had paid $24.47, two coins short, I'm sure the seller would not have shipped them to me.
Out of the 98 coins that were shipped, 48 were from duplicate countries. NOT duplicate coins. Even though some were from the same country, they were of different denomination.

While it doesn't quite have the interior details of a competitor's version, it also doesn't have issues with with the hinge of the lid being broken before or during shipping. It also costs less than 1/3 of the competitor's version! The copy I received was quite a bit darker than the images of the listed product, but that was easily rectified with some fine steel wool, a bit of wheel cleaner (designed to remove road grim and brake dust), and about 10 minutes worth of work to polish it up. Overall am I very pleased with this item! The only negative is that the plastic capsule it was shipped in arrived broken, but since I didn't even know the container was provided and I had no intention of displaying it that way, it's not an issue for me.",positive
