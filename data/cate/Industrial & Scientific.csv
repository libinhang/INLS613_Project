My sister in law and niece( haven‚Äôt seen them in 3 yrs) were on route by car from upstate NY after having attended a church outing. They wanted to drop by on route say hello maybe spend a night? I told my husband I insisted a Covid test despite their vaccine status+ booster.
I told them this - they snickered but reluctantly agreed. I set up a table and 2 chairs with a clock 6 feet away so they could test outside on the driveway . Said hello 20 feet away. One had already said she had a stuffy nose ‚Äú probably from the hotel A.C.‚Äù they stayed in over Memorial Day weekend. The instruction sheet very easy to read. I coached them from a far off distance outside. Sister in law - positive . Niece - . Negative. I suggested they either keep going and stay at the nieces house in Philly and isolate. I told them to take the 2 test kit with them . ‚Äú we will talk over the phone. ‚Äú The niece felt ‚Äú off that night‚Äù and tested herself again + the next day. The in law + again. They both felt like ‚Äú crap‚Äù , missed some time off from work etc- but both alive. The point being, easy to use, 2 in a box , ( other companies) only have one in box. You really need to test twice with symptoms. 15 min but more important if asymptomatic ( my niece) - . Not surprised because they had been together over a long weekend in an hotel room, in a car x 8 hrs , no masks. The only tricky part is I had to tell them from a distance how to squeeze the cotton swab in the test vial 10-15 times to extract potential viral material from the Nasal swab before the 3 drops go in the test well. The rest was easy to read. Who knows how many others were exposed) no masking was done at the event.
I caught an unnecessary exposure for my family. You will have to give guests the kit ( free), take some resistance, maybe damage a family relationship a little but this virus doesn‚Äôt care!
The test table is still on the driveway with outdoor chairs. Will be bleaching them all down wearing gloves , air dry before storing away.",positive

Anyway,your results depends on how you swab your nose. A faint line or faint lines in my opinion could depend on how you swab your nose, also when the virus is dissipating from the body it would show faint lines on the T part but brighter on C. If both are faint maybe you did not swab your nose correctly. Eventually the test will appear clear on the T when you are covid free. Please wear a mask even when it shows clear if you are still coughing. PCR did not detect covid in me, I did it twice during early symptoms and later down.I was sick with all the symptoms except diarrhea. I think maybe I didn't swab my nose properly, but with other family members it showed on this home test and the PCR test as positive. Older adults were more sick üò´ than the younger. * Don't get covid 19, it will age you even though you recover.Still sick!",positive
2,Industrial & Scientific,"iHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test, 2 Tests per Pack,FDA EUA Authorized OTC At-home Self Test, Results in 15 Minutes with Non-invasive Nasal Swab, Easy to Use & No Discomfort",$17.98,5,"These tests renewed my faith in antigen testing. That is, given an understanding of how they work. These are not hyper-sensitive like PCR tests. You need to present enough virus to register a positive. But the test gives a good snapshot of whether you are highly contagious at that exact moment.

This was all good stuff to know in theory. But we had never once seen a positive rapid test through all kinds of kid and adult coughs sickness. Until very recently, when my wife and I both ended up finally catching Covid. As the first chills began we both still tested negative. The next morning we were solid positive and stayed that way. Our two kids never developed symptoms and stayed negative throughout our recovery. But our tests remained positive for a week, with the test line becoming progressively more faint toward the end.

Unfortunately at this price, (which isn't bad) it isn't really feasible for a lot of people to go wild testing like crazy. But when we did have the opportunity to do that I was very reassured by the consistency of results. Just know that especially for vaccinated individuals who may show an immune response very early on, the first sign of symptoms may be too early to show up on an antigen test.

Also, if the vials aren't prefilled, I had much better luck cutting the solution packet with clean scissors to leave a better opening to get the solution into the vial.",positive

Stupid me, after going for 2.5 years without even a cold or sore throat I decided to remove my mask at a Chris Rock standup concert and 2 days later I felt a sore throat coming on. I immediately took an iHealth home test and BOOM, two lines showed up. My doctor prescribed medicine that same day and 10 days later I was ok. Being fully vaccinated with boosters was also a key element in only having one bad day. These tests are good to keep around the house just in case.

Well, think again! One week after getting the test, I contracted BA-5 in July 2022. It is hard to believe! I am fully vaccinated and boostered and wear a mask pretty faithfully. I performed both tests over a one week period and I can't tell you how convenient and easy it was. No walk-in clinics, no hours on line waiting to see a physician, peace of mind in less than 15 minutes.

I believe everyone needs these tests on standby. The cost is affordable and under $20. It's easy to read the results and it confirms what you already suspect. You have Covid-19 and isolate to protect your family and neighbors alike.",positive

It is the same test mailed out for free by the federal govt. in 2021. It is easy to use. You just drop about 3 drops of the liquid onto the designated place on a
plastic device and wait 15 minutes for a result. It's accuracy is probably not as good as the professionally administered test, but that test often requires an appointment and at least a couple of days to get a result.
If one is testing for recovery of COVID, it's likely not a bad idea to do the test at least twice before resuming
public activities.",positive

Nasal sinus rinse and theraflu tea only helped slightly. I had phlegm, couch, woke up drenched in sweat from chills, and my body was sore. I've had all vaccines including both boosters and have been working from home the majority of the pandemic. I went to an urgent care clinic my insurance referred me to. Although they tested me for Covid I have to wait 2 days on the results. Thank you god this at home kit came in today. Before I took the test I was actually thinking I was being dramatic about my symptoms or it was my stress making me have somatic complaints. Well, sure enough thanks to this test I don't have to wait two days to see if I have it. I have it. I was glad to see I have it because I literally thought I was going insane because the headache and flu like symptoms come in waves and when they hit... it hits hard.

Now the tubes seem to mostly come pre-filled, which, as another reviewer pointed out, sometimes doesn't come all the way to the minimum line. I've had at least 2 boxes recently where one of the tubes wasn't filled at all; had nothing in it. So that test was completely wasted. I've also had a couple of boxes where the test result didn't show up clear, was ambiguous - causing me to test again with a different brand to be sure of the result - or the result didn't show at all, despite following all the instructions meticulously.

We masked per regulations and were vaccinated, but still ended up getting COVID in June 2022. It can be difficult to tell whether sniffles, cough and sore throat are a cold, allergies, COVID or something else. These iHealth tests, while not 100% accurate, can determine if it is COVID. My husband and I are high risk, plus I‚Äôm occasionally around my elderly father, so it is important to us that we know. We used this brand every time we tested at home (first free kits from the government, then purchased). The box contains 2 tests, so it‚Äôs about $8.50/test, which is quite reasonable. It‚Äôs important you follow the step-by-step instructions; you will have your results 15 minutes later. It was this test that showed my husband was COVID positive, with my son and I being tested thereafter at an urgent care. A professional PCR test is more accurate, but these tests are good for home use. Note that the tests are good for 3 months after their stamped expiration date.",positive

I suppose I don't pay as much attention to advertising as 3rd graders, because I did not know this fact until it was pointed out to me by a 3rd grader.
Anyway... This paper is very soft. But the rolls are huge. I guess that's good, because you get a lot of sheets per roll. But it also means they look like commercial rolls. (The ones they put in public restrooms, retail store restrooms, rest stops, places like that.) They are absolutely gigantic. They look awkward in many toilet paper holders, and don't even fit in others. With the one toilet paper holder we have, these rolls end up scraping against the back for a while until enough sheets are used.

Dishes come out perfectly clean the first time, and I've never had an issue with leftover residue or undissolved detergent. The pack of 94 tabs has lasted us over 6 months and I'd say we probably wash dishes at least 3-4 times a week.

50,Industrial & Scientific,"CLINITEST Rapid Covid-19 Antigen Self-Test: Convenient-5 pack, test results in 15 minutes, FDA EUA Authorized OTC at-Home Self Test Kit",$25.00,4,"I've used this brand of rapid Covid test at least 7 times between myself, my husband, and our daughter. If you have symptoms, this test works great--even with very mild symptoms. My daughter complained of a sore throat one night, but the test was negative. The next morning, her throat hurt more, and the test was faintly positive (Her case was confirmed with a PCR test). When I looked back at a picture I had taken of the first test, I could see that I missed that there was a very faint line in the ""T"" position, so in reality the test the night before was positive, too. Maybe I just didn't want to believe she had Covid again. For the record, I used a different brand of rapid test on her back in January when she had strong symptoms, but it was negative. I took her the next day for a PCR test (when most of her symptoms had already subsided by that time), but it was positive.

This test is a bit more involved than other rapid tests I've used--in that you have to let the swab sit in the reagent for a minute before doing the whole add-drops-to-the-test-strip thing. But it seems to make it more accurate/reliable. I wish I had the other brand of test at the same time so I could have tested them both on my daughter to compare results.

Really, the only limitation I see of this test is the same as all other rapid tests--it will not turn positive as early as a PCR test. That is, you can HAVE Covid that turns a PCR test positive, but it generally takes one to three more days for a rapid test to turn positive.

There is not an abundance of solution to begin with and the directions do tell you to squeeze the fluid back out of the swab before removing it completely. I found that the plastic tube can easily withstand a fair amount of pressure from the outside to extract the fluid. Don't hesitate to give the swab a hearty squeeze, you should be fine.

151,Industrial & Scientific,"Forehead Thermometer, Baby and Adults Thermometer with Fever Alarm, LCD Display and Memory Function, Ideal for Whole Family",$16.99 - $20.99,3,"The overall design and quality of this product is great. However, unless I'm always hypothermic (I'm not) this is not reading body temperature, it's reading skin temperature / surface temp. I tried it on my forehead, arm, neck ...holding it very close up and at the recommended 1.5 inches...all gave various readings of 2 - 4 degrees LOWER than normal body temp (93-95F). A person can have a fever, or even normal BODY temp, but their skin could be much lower (or higher) depending on the environment their in, room temperature, etc. I got a close to normal reading from in my ear. I guess I don't have a fever, but it should read somewhere close to normal without having to go from body part to body part to find it.

It does instruct that ""both the patient and the thermometer should stay in steady-state room condition"". I'm not sure exactly what that means, except my guess is that I and it should be where there isn't a lot of temp changes (like outside).

So basically what I'm saying is that a device such as this for personal or family use when you want to see if you're running a fever: I wouldn't recommend it. I know doctor's offices and hospitals use this kind of device but theirs are more expensive, more accurate and far less picky about ambient temperatures, body places and distances, etc.

For me, I'll be staying with the ""old-fashioned"" kind of thermometer. This kind is just too finicky and unreliable. Oh, but it's great at telling you if your coffee is at the perfect temperature for you.",fair

I liked the brace so much I bought two more - one in a different color to wear during the regular day. I did hit one problem however. When very damp with sweat the brace took some effort to get off (removal when dry was no problem), and the force/way I held it to remove the damp brace has over the course of 2-3 weeks or so caused the sleeve containing one of the springs to start to detach from the fabric at the lower end.

I've bought various toilet cleaners over the years, including an expensive silicone scrubber, but the ease of using this makes it my number one choice.

I love that there's no need to buy messy expensive cleaning solutions, resulting in less plastic waste.

I did buy a mega pack of off-brand refills on Amazon which work ok, but they require more effort to attach to the wand, and then I have to pull them off the wand because they don't release like the Clorox ones do... so I save money but ew, have to use a rubber glove to remove the used scrubber.

220,Industrial & Scientific,Kleenex Multifold Paper Towels,$21.49 - $66.33,5,"I first saw pop up paper towel dispensers at my work (Tork brand), and liked the concept. You get 1 papertowel if you want one, or pull again for another. It's less wasteful and has exact dispensing, unlike rolls of papertowels that can get out of hand at home. We have a papertowel roll holder at home that works fine, but there are times where pulling a single sheet, tearing, and repeating isn't always a smooth operation.

I read reviews of different products from Kleenex, Kimberly Clark, Costco, etc, and found these were rated the best. Value wise, they can be a bit pricey, but if you do the math, it's not much more than normal rolls of papertowels at the store, and sometimes cheaper per piece. I usually wait for a ""used"" version to pop up on Amazon as it's just the box that's a bit scrunched up for quite a bit cheaper.

Although these have similar quantities of pieces to a normal paper towel roll, we go through these so much slower than a roll would. I think it's because of exact dispensing. We get exactly the number we want and no more. I was so happy I got a second dispenser for the garage (first went into the kitchen). No issues so far other than I'd suggest putting 80% of a pack of these into the Tork dispenser rather than the whole pack. It makes dispensing easier (if you go 100% of a pack, the top few will be more difficult to remove and potentially tear).

These towels are durable, absorb a decent amount, and have replaced blue paper towels in the garage for me. Kitchen spills - no problem. Bacon grease - works fine. Car fluids - easy.",positive

I use them in a dispenser in 2 bathrooms and the kitchen. My dispenser holds one and half of these packages. I read some reviews that mention the little pieces that are everywhere, it's true I pick them up off the floor and countertops all the time but it's from not pulling the paper towels correctly. If you pull with just one hand they CAN rip off where you are holding it but it doesn't always happen. Great brand, great product!",positive

I use them after washing my hands and while cooking to keep my hands clean before handling food. One towel does the job. I hate wasting paper and I never used paper towels before this. I reuse these, not for hands but for cleaning. I let them dry, and use them like paper towels for cleaning up messes since they‚Äôre not really dirty after just drying clean hands. There is only me at my house and a case has lasted me a year and a half. I haven‚Äôt bought a dispenser. I use the long tissue boxes and they work fine.

We have 3 dogs, 2 of them are Huskies. This simplistic tool helps me keep all the hair in check when i dont want to use my dyson or for areas that are hard to vacuum, like pet beds or the couch.
I did dock a star due to the lack of emphasis they put on what kind of materiel you should Not use this on. The directions off handedly say not to use it on knit fabrics, but as some of the other reviews state, the UpRoot tool will destroy any delicate fabrics. If you are buying this with the intention of using it on anything other than low pile carpet/area rugs, pet beds and the animal itself (which out of curiosity you try, but really isnt that effective) then i dont recommend it.
As for price, i purchased this more expensive one because it was the one i kept seeing on Instagram ads, but the design of the tool seems pretty basic, so i would be willing to bet a cheaper one probably would work just as well.",positive
231,Industrial & Scientific,"Uproot Cleaner Pro Reusable Cat Hair Remover - Special Dog Hair Remover Multi Fabric Edge and Carpet Scraper by Uproot Clean - Easy Pet Hair Remover for Couch, Pet Towers & Rugs - Gets Every Hair!",$22.99,4,"I bought this to help un-matt my 12 year old medium pile carpet - in the main traffic areas, it looks pretty rough. I tried a carpet rake, but that didn't work because the bristles just didn't dig deep enough to get into the mats. When I saw someone on social media suggest this tool I bought one to try it out - again, primarily for de-matting the carpet, secondarily for removing hair.

The bad news (for me) is that it did not work for un-matting the carpet. It just kind of moved the direction the mats were facing back and forth, depending on which way you brushed across it. Downstairs, where the carpet is vacuumed approx. 1x / day by a robot vacuum, it didn't pull up any pet hair either (we have 3 cats and 2 dogs), and I mostly got just a bit of the actual carpet fiber. Not too much, it wasn't damaging

I won't use this for de-matting / fluffing old carpet. I've found a dog brush - the kind with the very thin metal bristles - works best for that purpose.

Next I tried upstairs, where vacuuming is much less frequent - I won't say how often, it's embarrassing. That said, this purchase coincided with the purchase of a new robot vacuum, which has been run upstairs about 7 times in the last 2 days. The tool didn't pull up much pet hair initially. Bummer. So I tool the dog brush to the same area, de-matted it, and then tried this tool. Now we got some results - it was pulling out enough hair for it to be worthwhile.

So, for me, it'll be de-matt the carpet with the dog brush, then go over it with this to pull up pet and human hair. It's going to be a very tedious process with two handheld tools, but it looks so much better, I think it'll be worth it.",positive
