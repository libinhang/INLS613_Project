36,Magazine Subscriptions,Better Homes & Gardens,$5.00,5,"I enjoy this magazine. I subscribed to the print subscription so I can tear out pages with recipes or ideas to try, and it's an inexpensive way to have some pleasant leisure time. I do have a question: How many issues should I get? I believe the print subscription for a year is 12 issues, but I have noticed issues sometimes combine two months and I am also missing a month or two. Are their ""special"" issues that are added to give me 12 issues?",positive
37,Magazine Subscriptions,Better Homes & Gardens,$5.00,3,"I am not sure if the internet is driving my perspective, but it seems that the monthly offerings in BHG are just 'meh."" Like the magazine I received this month. There were pictures of privileged people who bought an old stone house and refurbished it in grand modern style. I mean....common, who in the bottom 60% of Americans will EVER be able to afford a fancy place like that??? In the country, with a 40 minute drive outside a large city (i.e. where property values are the highest....look up ""Donut Syndrome"" which is sociological term, describing White privilege moving to suburbs. They had a lovely pool, gardens, and great big windows. Yeah--who wouldn't like that? I have looked into installing a small (12' x 24') swimming pool in my small yard, and even with looking at more 'affordable"" options, like a fiberglass small pool, with permits and grade work, concrete coping/deck work, plumbing/drainoff work, security gates, filtration and window/door alarms (coding requirements)...it's $40,000+ for the 'lesser"" quality stuff. Who the hell can afford that???? If BHG actually high lighted more modest homes and showed what people have done with small affordable spaces to make them nicer, then maybe they would be relevant. After flipping through this month's magazine, I felt like it was peddling a lie--most Americans will never have ANYTHING remotely close to what is in that magazine. Probably won't renew my subscription, unless future issues are more down to earth and relevant to average people. I am not a ""keep up with the Jone's"" type of person, but I do value a happy living environment, so either I am not affluent enough for this magazine, or it is only targeting people with enough disposable income to $40,000 a year projects on their home. Ain't me. It would take me more than 10 years to be able to do something that grand (if I were lucky, barring any unforeseen catastrophes), more like a once in a lifetime expense.",fair

40,Magazine Subscriptions,Reader's Digest,$8.00,1,"First, it had been many years since I saw a copy of this magazine. My mother had a subscription going all the way back to the 1950's, my grandmother had a subscription going back to her own childhood. My mother inherited all her mothers copies when my grandmother died. I inherited those going back to February 1922, just over 1000 issues. I still have them. I have since read every issue. I hadn't read it in years, not since the late 1970's. I was missing 2007-2020 and figured I could catch up at the public library. I saw it advertised here on Amazon in 2020 and felt nostalgic so I ordered a one year subscription for $5. I got about $5 worth. It is unfortunate that the publishers have decided to reduce the Wallace's masterpiece into something for people with short attention spans. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. The magazine is 1/4 the size I remember and it shrunk from a monthly subscription to ten times a year. I decided not to renew.

In the autumn of 2021 I continued to receive issues past my one year subscription date. I took the issue back to the post office with a note attached telling them to cancel. I continued to get issues and have repeated this every time they sent an issue since. I was just reviewing my account and discovered a charge for $17.98 for a renewal and Amazon told me they could not cancel the subscription that it was too late. I checked the archive of my purchases and discovered that they slipped this by me last year and I never noticed on my checking account. I have gone from disappointed to furious. Not only have they desecrated the Wallace's masterpiece but they have turned it into a criminal enterprise!

I strongly recommend NOT ordering this subscription. If your local library has this magazine archived I suggest going there and reading copies from prior to this century. The worst article from before 2000 is infinitely better than the best one I read in the one year of subscription that I authorized.

One final note. They are no longer publishing 10 issues a year. If you order this and expect 10 issues you will be disappointed. This magazine is now only published 9 times a year. And while it always had advertising, it is now more than 50% advertising which is another extreme disappointment.",negative

51,Magazine Subscriptions,HGTV Magazine,$8.00,4,"HGTV Magazine is a great learning tool for decorating with old and new items.
I know I'm going to enjoy devouring my HGTV mag every time I take it out of my mailbox. I try to carefully read every page even if it doesn't instantly interest me because I know it will promote new ideas I can use to decorate and enhance the beauty in my home. Honestly I realize that some of the items are very high priced but if you keep an open mind you might just be able to find something similar or close to that item at Goodwill or a Habitat for Humanity ReStore or yard sale or at least push your thought process into a totally different area that you never would have though of otherwise. I find myself thinking ""I never would have though I would like THAT with THAT!"" How far I've progressed! Best Wishes!",positive
52,Magazine Subscriptions,HGTV Magazine,$8.00,5,It's so hard for me to find time to read these but they are chock full of useful ideas. I love that the spreads are adventurous. Reading on the kindle app also makes it super easy to clip ideas!,positive
53,Magazine Subscriptions,HGTV Magazine,$8.00,5,"It's crazy to get this high quality magazine for only $5! Take advantage! If you're worried about auto-renewal issues, see my tried and true fix below. This is my second year of HGTV magazine, and it has yet to disappoint. It's jam packed with home redecorating ideas specific to the season. My absolute favorite part of this magazine is the ""fun decorating"" page in issue that shows expensive items and their cheaper alternative. (For example - a high end rug with a similar looking rug at over half the cost.) There's great advice on choosing paint colors for different rooms and how-to lessons on the correct way to refinish and paint furniture. I love the ""spot the difference"" advice as well - learning the differences between various furniture and home goods so you're on your A-game in any conversation. Also included is a great recipe in each edition. I've clipped many of these and they've turned out to be easy and delicious! Pretty much anything you can think of that has to do with your home is included in this magazine. If nothing else, it makes for a colorful and festive bathroom book that anyone can flip through and enjoy. My 12-year old daughter loves it for their crafts, cooking, and how-to advice. I love it as a cheap way to get ideas to spruce up my home. There aren't too many advertisements or wasted space either.

I haven't had any problems with unwanted auto-renewal of my magazines on Amazon as long as I follow these steps to turn it off:
1) Go to your account and look under Membership and Subscriptions.
2) Find ""Print Magazines.""
3) Once selected, you will see all of your current magazine subscriptions and when they will be renewed at the lowest Amazon price.
4) Simply turn off the ""auto-renewal"" setting by selecting auto-renewal settings and ""turn off.""

57,Magazine Subscriptions,HGTV Magazine,$8.00,2,"I have gotten HGTV for years. I renewed in October and I got it regularly until the under of the year. After that I got two issues. I thought it got lost in the mail so the automated customer service extended my subscription by a month.
However in our next door app for neighborhood of over 500 homes people were complaining about not getting their issues of their magazine and other from that company. The person that wrote in the Nextdoor app stated she had contacted customer service and they were using a different carrier and not United States Postal Service but they wouldn’t say who, strange. So now I am stuck waiting on the phone because they don’t have an email address to contact them.
So a warning, I love the paper magazines no the less I might be going to digital. Also, if this is a way for the company to push for more digital content, there has got to be a way better way.",negative
58,Magazine Subscriptions,HGTV Magazine,$8.00,5,"My mother & I had many times jointly reading HGTV magazine. I had purchased one before my trip to the nursing home to see her. To my surprise she was having a fantastic day…awake, alert, feeding herself & eating everything on her tray. It was a great visit.
After that visit I ordered this magazine for her & a golf magazine for my father. This magazine arrived a few days ago. Really great speed since I ordered it, but my mother died July 11.
I haven’t looked at the magazine yet. It’s sitting right beside me.
I will enjoy the magazine….even if my Mom didn’t get the chance. It really is a great magazine if you watch HGTV and their type of content",positive

It’s a fun, fast paced first of all and all the TRENDY THINGS,PLACES & great ideas for keeping the cost 💲 of redecorating your home, offices or children’s rooms, etc.etc.etc! Food magazines were good, REAL Magazines good but this has a different twist for the young & even older baby boomers styles… $18 bucks & loving relaxing looking at exciting NEW IDEAS!! Good Luck, Cynthia:)",positive
60,Magazine Subscriptions,Vanity Fair,$8.00,4,"I think V.F. has sometimes been unfairly dismissed as a lightweight Hollywood or ""chick"" magazine. Well OK, the cover story (and photo) is usually in the entertainment field, and the publisher's media kit states that the readership is 79 percent female. What's gender got to do with it? Most of the stories are serious and intelligent enough to be worthy of anyone's attention. Consider, for example, some of the topics of recent articles: the background behind the financial meltdown at Lehman Brothers; the $3 trillion cost of the Iraq war; Vladimir Putin's power grab in Russia; real estate woes in the Hamptons and at the Plaza Hotel; Rupert Murdoch's media empire; Bobby Kennedy's ill-fated 1968 presidential campaign...to name just a few. The depth and sophistication of these stories, and the quality of the writing, is certainly equal to anything you'd find in the Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic Magazine, The New Yorker, and similar ""serious"" publications. Even the movie star subjects, such as the recent cover story on Marilyn Monroe, generally have a weightier slant to them. Don't confuse this with the mindless junk you'd find in supermarket tabloids. As for those ""shocking"" photos of Miley Cyrus....well, the whole controversy seemed to be almost a satire of how a puritanical public can become outraged about nothing. At any rate, I would not have wanted to miss what the outcry was all about. I find that every month there is always something worth reading, and I learn a few things as well as being entertained. So why four stars instead of five? Well, while depth and details are good, I find that some of the articles tend to be a little too long, and about halfway through I'm tempted to start skimming. Also, Graydon's Carter's Bush-bashing editorials month after month can get a little tiresome. I'm not a big admirer of Bush myself, but it's long past time to ""give it a rest"".
These small complaints aside, I recommend this as a very worthwhile publication. A word about price: the promotional rates at Amazon are typically better that those on the postcards inserted in the magazine, plus you avoid that ridiculous ""postage and handling"" fee. Twenty bucks total for two years (at Amazon), which is about the cost of a mere four copies purchased individually at the newsstand, seems too good a deal to pass up.",positive
61,Magazine Subscriptions,Vanity Fair,$8.00,4,"I have absolutely no interest in the fashion aspect of this magazine but each issue always has one, and usually more, interesting articles on a wide variety of topics. Absolutely worth the low subscription price.",positive
62,Magazine Subscriptions,Vanity Fair,$8.00,3,"It's a matter of preference and I don't happen to like rescue stories or praise-god stories, so not much of any given issue has huge appeal to me. But I like the brain teasers at the back, and some of the jokes are really good (and some not). And there's usually a joke or two that you already heard a year or two ago.

The magazine's intended audience seems to be old folks. Me, I look like I'm in my mid-70s, but I'm only 40 on the inside. So I'm not yet much of a connoisseur of corny yet.",fair
63,Magazine Subscriptions,Vanity Fair,$8.00,5,"I requested a refund as the magazine has just gotten too liberal for my taste. It has changed, did not used to be that way.",positive
64,Magazine Subscriptions,Vanity Fair,$8.00,4,"I gave Vanity Fair 4 stars based on the photography alone. When taken in concert with the tone of recent anti-Bush articles, it drops to 2 stars. Now I might not agree with the magazine's political point of view but that's not really my beef. The problem is this isn't supposed to be a political magazine! It's about fashion, society, Hollywood, travel, etc. There are so many political magazines available that if one is looking for that kind thing, it's easy enough to find. Why must the left continue to demonstrate that they truly do control the media and use that influence time and time again to push their agenda? It wouldn't be so bad if they were honest about it by telling readers that Vanity Fair was a political magazine, but they don't. If you look at the cover and the articles mentioned, you will see few, if any, references to the Bush bashing that's inside. As an example, a recent issue featured a shirtless David Beckham on the cover. They used the sex angle to sell copies but once you opened the magazine, you'd find no less than 7 articles that talked about Bush, the Republican party or the Iraqi war. All of this is mixed in between pages of the shirtless soccer player and various Hollywood celebs. Again, I'm not against a magazine with a political agenda, I'm just disappointed it has to be this one. I wish they'd stick with what they do best and leave the politics to someone else. Let's face it, we know this is a Hollywood magazine and therefore know the political point of view to which they subscribe. We don't have to be hit over the head with it every issue. After a while, it begins to look pitiful. Hopefully, after the election, things will get back to normal because the photography by Annie Leibovitz, Bruce Weber and the late Herb Ritts is terrific.",positive
65,Magazine Subscriptions,Vanity Fair,$8.00,5,"If I had to subscribe to only one magazine, this would be it. I love the Editor section, the parties, the book reviews, the letters, articles on up-and-comers ... then there are THE stories. There are so many interesting stories I've read in VF and I have enjoyed the stories -- even if the content wasn't of interest to me upon first glance. But just after reading a paragraph or two? Every story I read, no matter the content, is fascinating!

When I first started subscribing (ages ago), I discovered VF authors and began my long-time admiration for the magazine! The finance articles by Michael Lewis and others are amazing; the late Dominick Dunne made me feel as though ""I"" were in the middle of the most wonderful stories he told; and, of course, there was the late, great Christopher Hitchens. I enjoyed his articles and later respected his books and talks! Those were the authors I discovered through the magazine years ago and I will continue to subscribe so that I can discover new, wonderful & exciting authors and stories I have come to expect and love! In case you can't tell, I recommend this magazine!!!",positive
66,Magazine Subscriptions,Vanity Fair,$8.00,5,"I have grown to really respect Vanity Fair. For a long time I read it for its enjoyable collection of reporting about the rich and famous. Kind of like People Magazine, up many notches for class and honesty. I felt like I was being allowed behind the curtain of the ""Beautiful People"" But in recent years it has evolved into a role of writing strong and well-written articles about politics, and important people. Kind of like the NYT, but with charm and in-depth social analysis. Its astonishing use of covers alone is worth the subscription. It has switched from bosomy starlets to black women of accomplishment. It still has the starlets, but less often. And the starlets only get one page review, while the women of color and accomplishment emerge as three-dimensional figures. I highly recommend it.",positive

69,Magazine Subscriptions,Vanity Fair,$8.00,4,"Vanity Fair is head and shoulders above ""People"" magazine. It targets those uppty folks who won't read those fashion rags, but still want to know about the rich and famous. Sometimes its really good reading but mostly I could care less. Exception is the murder and mayhem from the expose of the Show jumping (horses) circuit. (Re-written into the book ""Hot Blood"", which if you missed it is a great read into the greed of rich people. You'd have thought that there was such a thing as so much money you wouldn't have to cheat insurance companies but I guess I didn't factor in the cost of a top rated jumping horse.) The covers have in the past been very cutting edge. Anyone remeber the issue with Demi Moore in full body paint and a minor shadow? But who is dating who on the movie sets is not what I care about. If you do, get this one over the others.",positive

72,Magazine Subscriptions,Family Handyman,$10.00,3,"After reading the reviews and the inexpensive $8.95 price tag, I thought this magazine would make a great gift for my handy husband. He wasn't impressed with the first two issues and complained of advertisements crowding the magazine. He was excited to read a good article on beginning welding in his 3rd issue. I took some time to leaf through the magazine before writing this review. The advertisements are exhausting. For example, in the first 10 pages of one issue, I counted 3 full page advertisements and 3 half page advertisements. It's like that throughout the remainder of the magazine as well. This is really unfortunate as it takes away from the readability of the magazine. There is some useful information presented such as ""stuff we love"" which outlines favorite DIY tools, material, and gear. There are Pro tips (example: installing an irrigation system), reader DIY tips, and a handful of projects with decent instructions. Unfortunately, most of the projects haven't interested my husband.

74,Magazine Subscriptions,Family Handyman,$10.00,4,"==== SUMMARY ====
Overall an enjoyable read for the low price. I usually find something useful in it. True, it's ad-heavy but I tear those pages out to reduce shelf clutter. The main 2 downsides are that 1) over the years, they start to repeat the same tips over-and-over again. e.g., caulking tips, painting tips, etc, and 2) if you're an experienced DIY'er or trade professional, there are other magazines that are better-suited for experienced handy men and women. Nevertheless, it's cheap entertainment that I enjoy reading.

For experienced DIYers, I recommend looking into ""This Old House"", ""Old House Journal"" and/or woodworking-focused magazines like ""Workbench"", ""Wood"", ""Fine Woodworking"", etc.

Useful tips & tricks for simple projects
Quick, easy read
Decent reviews on new tools

=== CONS ===

Tips become repetitive

77,Magazine Subscriptions,Family Handyman,$10.00,4,"Update April 2021:
There seems to be a lot of reviews talking about only getting one issue every couple of months. I want people to understand that a 1 year subscription is 9 issues so don't expect it to show up every month. I would certainly like it to be more regular, but it isn't.

Another comment is the number of adds, every magazine of this type, I have seen, has a lot of adds. That is how we get to pay such low prices. While I have little doubt they have researched the types of adds that might catch the eye of their readers, most of them have nothing to do with me.

I have been an on/off subscriber to this magazine for a lot of years, it keeps getting thinner but the quality of what is in there seems to still be ok. If I had to pay the prices shown in the renewal notices I get with the magazine I wouldn't purchase it, but the price here on Amazon is half that if you time it right.

Original Review:
The magazine itself is good, There are a range of types of projects/tips from the ""Seen that already"" to the ""wow that's cool"" I tend to use this magazine as inspiration rather than a specific howto.

After I subscribed I received The previous issue and current issue the same day, then 2 weeks later I received the next months issue. To be honest I don't know how to feel about that.

In my case I had already purchased the previous months issue from a store so I didn't need that one. I think I would have rather just had the subscription start with the one that came 2 weeks later.",positive

79,Magazine Subscriptions,Family Handyman,$10.00,4,"Having designed and built our own home with our own hands (layman, with strong skills in this area), this magazine will not furnish you with big ideas and ""how to"" to perform such endeavors. None surprising, given the title of the magazine.
Never-the-less, I find it a fun rag to peruse and usually get right down to it, when it lands in my hands.

I enjoy the ideas presented in this magazines; which are simple to create, with the how-to given within the pages. Ideas and instructions that an average person, with basic understanding of shop tools & materials can follow and complete in a relatively short time.

The curious and casual homeowning DIY'er, I think, would appreciate this magazine the most. Though, do not expect to be ""blown away.""
To give you an idea of what is included in this issue (03/10), my latest copy contains:

Under Features:

* Carved stone fountain (Build it in a weekend: no stone cutting experience required!)
* Recipe for a lush lawn (Let Mr. Lawn show you how to wipe out weeds, water smart and fertilize right.)
* Easy cabinet repairs (Simple fixes for everything from stubborn drawers to dull finishes.)
* Tips for a low-maintenance pond (A little extra care and effort now will mean alot less work later.)

Under Departments:

* Home care & repair (Fix for crumbling brick mortar.)
* Do's & Don'ts (Craft beautiful painted trim from MDF instead of wood.)
* Instant Project (Wren houses made from vinyl fence posts and caps? Brilliant!)
* New Tools & Gear (A big-heat soldering torch and a propane powered leaf blower.)
* Question & Comment (Do-it-yourself rain barrels, extension cord repairs.)
* Reader Projects (From trash to treasure.)
* Car & Garage (Six easy, money saving fixes for ATV's and motorcycles.)
* Dollar Savvy Homeowner (Choosing the right concrete landscaping block.)
* Handy Hints (Stay put sofa shoes, no mess paint touch-up and more.)
* Shop Rat (A mega table for portable table saws and a cool little bench.)
* Wordless Workshop (Fast, easy workbench drawers.)
* Great Goofs (A sledge, a fencepost and a water line. Need we say more?)

You can visit the website: [...] to get an idea of the magazine, as well given extra ideas/tips that will not be shown in the magazine.

I would like to see this magazine include, perhaps at least quarterly, a more complex project. I certainly do not think it would upset it's subscribers.
When my subscription nears expiration, I plan to re-subscribe. Thus far, it's been a fun magazine to peruse and have found some useful ideas within. Here's hoping that they will see a benefit to it's readership and to their magazine, to occasionally place bigger ideas and how-to within their magazine periodically.",positive

I got this subscription for the ridiculously low price of $5 for a year's worth of issues. There is no scam here...I've ordered $5 magazines from Amazon for the past 2 years and it's a simple process to avoid automatic renewing with an increased charge. Simply go to your account and look under Membership and Subscriptions. Find ""Print Magazines.""

111,Magazine Subscriptions,Condé Nast Traveler,$5.00,5,"Conde-Nast's Traveler is not my first choice in travel publications; I originally confused it with the National Geographic Travel magazine and 'clicked' before I finished reading. The price was within my comfort zone so I let it ride and anticipated a pleasant surprise.
I wasn't surprised, at least not positively. But by chance I offered Traveler to a young friend and last year it became her very most favored magazine. In this the second year of subscribing, I no longer even open the magazine, though it often looks very inviting, but rather quickly pass it directly to this young reader.
By giving Traveler a second chance it now earns highest marks. First it is very visually interesting and appealing to my reader who is totally unfamiliar with the outer world and very eager to see all she can see. Additionally, the zine teaches as it goes; my young friend is making lists of what to do and expect and is looking up additional information. And finally, we live in a very remote part of the American West and Traveler is fueling the dreams of this young girl.
Way to go, folks. Our kids often fail to dream bigger dreams than this tiny town can fulfill. Your magazine is helping at least one person reach out and beyond our mountain wilderness. Thanks. =",positive

That is when we decided it was worth paying for a subscription to the magazine.

This information offers so much information and we can turn the T.V. off and read and learn through other methods such as National Geographic which officers world wide educational information.

The photography is very beautiful and also educational. This magazine is very valuable to our family and worth the return on our investment (subscription to the magazine). We gain so much knowledge from this magazine and for our household, we will pay more for knowledge than material things (cars, house, brand name clothes etc)..

Our children love the photography and it allows us to use this educational magazine as a means to teach our children to gain information, news, knowledge, etc from other sources other than the T.V. This magazine exposes our children to articles and other information that they may have not been exposed to through school or our community. Our children can use their imagination and go far away without leaving our home.

You will find the subject matter, photography, and writing very interesting and informative. This magazine is one that will give back to you.. We only subscribe to National Geographic and one other magazine. We only subscribe to the best!

This magazine will enrich your household and take you places you could never imagine!

140,Magazine Subscriptions,Men's Health,$8.00,2,"My first Men's Health mag was several years ago and at the time I was just whipping into getting into shape again. I found a set of exercises I absolutely loved and to this day favor those same ones.
Now with two years of subscriptions, I dread them. There is no proper index to flip to exactly what you wanted from the cover (or anything else) and what is there is painfully formatted. You're hit with a pretty normal amount of ads that make sense, but then are hit with things that are self destructive (smoking and alcohol) or garbage novelty crap. Now with this latest edition March 2022, which I'm getting in June, it's promoting illicit drugs and talking about polygamy and casual kink sex.
I'm all for a magazine having fun stuff to stick in there, but I want my health magazine to promote HEALTHY things! If I wanted self-destructive behavior, I can spend my time on Reddit and Twitter for free. I'm never touching this mag again.",negative
141,Magazine Subscriptions,Men's Health,$8.00,3,"It said on a cover, LOOK BETTER INSTANTLY! So I bought a subscription to this magazine because, you know, just having the subscription turns you into the guy on the cover without any work. I immediately saw muscle mass increase, chiseled jaw, deeper booming voice, and women flocked to me like I worked as a erotic novel writer, fireman, astronaut, cowboy, guitar player, part time underwear model and was a millionaire. Ok, maybe it wont work the same for you, but the magazine might attract a woman when she sees it on your table knowing you are at least hopefully masculine which in itself seems to be more rare these days and read Men's Health because you want to be the healthiest you can be or just get some general knowledge.

I wont complain about the magazine changing over time, and apparently paying for a magazine subscription doesnt remove the nearly half of it thats filled with ads. Todays issues still do contain some useful advice on working out, fitness, sex, grooming tips, nutrition, and occasional articles you wont want to skip. The working out and fitness are more detailed, while the nutrition and health dont always go in depth. For example talking about the huge problem of infertility was basic about alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, diet and exercise rather then the real issues like endocrine disruptors in plastics, chemicals, estrogens from heavy metals and other sources, emf/wifi etc. Get a haircut...and then get a job. Clean your act up, and dont be a slob. At least you can rub those samples of colognes over you which might help your chances since women respond to scent more then bank account balances.",fair

144,Magazine Subscriptions,Men's Health,$8.00,3,"So I ordered this magazine and for almost a year I've been reading it. I have to admit, it's not entirely what I expected. I've picked up a random issue for review, September 2007 to be exact. So here goes...

The GOOD: The articles in here are well-written for the most part, and many of them are related to actual health. This issue, which features an odd dual-issue format with Jamie Foxx on one cover and Andy Samberg from SNL on the back, has an article about the decline in testosterone (good) and stories about cooking healthier (also good). Some of the ads in this issue are geared toward men too, such as the Ford Super Duty and Jeep ads.

The BAD: In my opinion, there's *way* too much focus on fashion in this magazine. It's bad on normal months, but this issue has a whole section donated to it (the back, upside-down section). They seem to want me to buy a $750.00 pair of ugly Beatles-boots and by far the ugliest watch I've ever seen, the Zenith Defy Xtreme Open for $29,700.00. Not sure who this magazine is catering to but I bought a subscription to learn more about healthy living. There are entire magazines out there devoted to the type of guy who has money to burn and cares so much about a certain image (in otherwords, a poser). I didn't expect it from this magazine. And it's not that I want to tell this magazine what it should or shouldn't be... it's just that I don't want any part of this whole image thing. You can buy some great high-quality and functional men's items without going overboard with materialism, and I don't want a magazine that promotes that.

The UGLY: That Zenith watch takes the cake. Seriously, look it up online. It looks like something from a cereal box. I might wear it if it was free, but I'd have to wear long sleeves to cover it up. A watch shouldn't cost more than a new car. If it does... you're a poser :)

Overall: This magazine has some good fatures but it's too fashion-oriented for my tastes.",fair

Even though it's easy to get sticker shock, it's still fun to admire the creative efforts of first rate interior designers, architects, and photographers. There are quite a few ads, but most of the ads are posh (Chanel, Tiffany and Company, Louis Vuitton, Cartier etc.), so the ads are often beautiful, too. I'm enjoying Elle Decor, even if it is a little like that commercial for e-Trade. You know the one where they show a totally miserable guy flying economy with a kid kicking his seat. Then the guy gets up and starts walking in slow-motion towards first class while Tony Bennet belts out ""Fly Me to the Moon"". It's classic. As our guy gets closer to first class he glimpses what can only be the beautiful people enjoying cocktails. The stewardess beams a beautiful, welcoming smile as she rudely snaps the curtain shut in front of him. Then the message: ""First Class is there to remind you you're not in first class. Don't get mad, get e-Trade."" Totally my favorite commercial. Ever. Five stars for the magazine that gives us a glimpse into first class.",positive
149,Magazine Subscriptions,Men's Health,$8.00,4,"Just a word of caution for those interested in subscribing - I really enjoy this magazine but I have chime in with some recent reviews that the publisher is very slow in getting this subscription going. A little over two months ago I ordered several magazine subscriptions and so far my first issue of Elle Decor has still not arrived where several other subscription were received within 5-6 weeks.

as far as the magazine goes, from my past ED issues I find it the homes they feature have a great balance between modern, eclectic and chic design - definitely leans toward lux!

02/06/12 Update: My first issue, March 2012 has just arrived (12 weeks wait total).

A couple of highlights from this issue:

* Antique patterns and timeless fables inspire Idarica Gazzoni's fabrics and wallpaper
* Trend Alert - Paisley gets its groove back
* Great Ideas - Dazzling chandeliers add drama to a room

and my personal favorite article in Design Solutions called ""A Good Buy"", featuring some terrific smaller space ideas for living and dining spaces.

150,Magazine Subscriptions,Wired,$8.00,2,"I subscribed to this magazine because I am into technology and thought that this would give me insight into new advances, releases, etc. - and because there was a very palatable $8 annual subscription fee. I have received two issues now and have chosen to end my subscription because the effect of receiving each issue is not that I become educated about anything, but rather that I feel brought down a notch after being at the receipt point of an onslaught of politically biased, useless communication. Instead of focusing on the epic advances being made by the likes of Tesla, SpaceX, Google, etc., the magazine engages primarily in the now all-too-common practice of underhandedly (but quite obviously) inventing obscure but apparently heinous problems that are - apparently - attributable to the Trump Administration, or working out intelligent ways to position reality as being detestable and the result of our country's pestiferous republican infection.

In short (but not that short), it is another publication that I do not wish to read due to its breathtaking adherence to a palpable agenda/narrative that pretends that the viewpoint and opinion of half of America's citizens does not matter, and that jamming useless propaganda down our throats is more important than educating us.",negative

Instead, it's all prose; one long story written as a fictional narrative, in a near-future fantasy that takes place entirely in a hypothetical world...& that I have no interest in reading at all...

I don't know what happened to Wired!

It is, after all, still ""Wired""...).

I'd say, IF you find Oprah Winfrey's Book of the Month Club just too demanding...and wished she would instead strictly select (very) short novellas, ...and maybe add in a little more ""techno-futuristic meets Dungeons & Dragons"" fan fiction every once in a while, ...and definitely axe the post-read discussion because, frankly, you only have time to hear just one point of view—your own! Or, more aptly, your own...that is itself a misinterpretation of Oprah's point of view! (Oprah has her share of political detractors, ...but no one can claim she doesn't understand the point of a book club!)...

IF all that sounds like it's just what you've been looking for, THEN this new Wired is probably for you. AND IF it does not... THEN this new Wired is probably not for you...and you would be well advised to avoid...at least for the foreseeable future.

*And as an update for my 2nd Wired...Yikes! ...Well, the format has shifted again, adding some articles back into the magazine... However, what I have read in this issue, I am deeply disturbed. They added in a piece from the former Editor of Wired, and that's good; however, the two stories flanking front & back of that story are extremist agenda driven. The first piece is a blatant attempt at subversion...I guess I didn't see that one coming?! BUT! It is in the ""story."" ...It fails early into the piece for a multitude of reasons, but the objective is obvious...and it is not gun control; subversion is not the tool to get that done! And the final piece galvanizes the first...and the magazine as a whole...as overt subversion.

And! I paid $5 for poorly written subversion...(?)! Wired is a bonafide total rip-off!",negative

153,Magazine Subscriptions,Wired,$8.00,4,"For many years wired was THE magazine of a technological future, presenting technologically driven material as a world changing force. This was nerdiness without submission, and one could be interested in technology without retreating from the world. The world was becoming technology.

There was plenty of technocratic bombast, many things that were written about died in the cradle, and Wired was as closely linked to the dot-com boom as any publication, but few magazines could grasp the present, and grasp ideas of the future so well as Wired.

Wired also had a countercultural edge because it, simply because the people involved with it were willing to play with, or at least touch, any interesting and new idea that fell within Wired's orbit. This was not a magazine for everyone, but it fit its niche well.

Lately something in the tone of the magazine seems to be changing. Rather than reporting from the inside of the technologically driven world, it seems as if Wired is increasingly chasing celebrities, and involving itself with things that are trendy in the media world.

Wired is not gone, per se, but frankly, when you see Martha Stewart on the cover, apparently because she is famous, and has hired people to integrate, in no novel or overwhelming way, a website with her other media activities, it is safe to say that Wired is becoming disconnected with its audience. While many articles are still interesting, the number of good ones is declining, and the tone of the magazine has shifted. One gets a strong feeling reading it that many of the staffers used to work at Cosmopolitan or Time, and are really more interested in faddish popular crisis and fashion than they are in technology. I can't yet say that Wired is bad, and there is no good substitute for it that I know about, but unfortunately, it seems as if the magazine is heading downhill.",positive
154,Magazine Subscriptions,Wired,$8.00,4,"Wired on Kindle is great. The articles offer a fascinating look into the future, the writers know their stuff, the graphics are top-notch. For $5 a year (the selling point), you couldn't get a better subscription deal!

That said, there are some negatives. Firstly, you can't get the magazine on desktop. Which is a bummer because I'm not too keen to squint at tiny sans-serif text on a mobile screen (the images and graphics also don't get their due).

To read legible, large text, you have to switch between 'Magazine Mode' (where you are looking at a magazine page about the size of your mobile screen) or Text Mode (plain, colorless but readable text). There is no middle ground feature which sucks.

Bottom line is it's just $5/year. You can't do better than that so I guess the cons are worth the price.",positive

They seem to find excellent journalists who investigate or report on some interesting topics. Definitely tech oriented but my wife who is not in tech, enjoys reading it also.

Only concern is that occasionally they have an author who is way too heavy on left leaning issues. So much that it gets in the way of good journalism. It is the rare journalist who can report without editorializing and for the most part that is what they have. I hope they don't go down the slippery slope of lax journalism by undisciplined writers.

156,Magazine Subscriptions,Wired,$8.00,4,"Wired used to be a lot better than it is now. They seem to be more formulaic with their selection of articles these days whereas 5 or 7 years ago they where more organic and risky. there may have been a dud issue once in a while but their topics made me contemplate ideas and parts of society or technologies that I either didn't know to exist or wrongly thought that I wouldn't be interested in. Now they have some mandatory topic categories that they need to cover in every issue. They even have an obligatory crime/suspense article which while mildly interesting seems to have no place in wired. The media/entertainment section is tired. I skip it completely. I think Wired doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it for geeks or nerds? I serves both of us better than any other magazine out there, don't get me wrong, but I fear it is on a trajectory that will ultimately cause me to not renew one year.

Wired HAS to be one of the most interesting magazines I have read in my sixty-six years. I read it front to back. Occasionally, an article my not be within my scope of interest, but by and large, most articles are interesting. Normally, the main cover article is the longest...but it is also the best written and most interesting article. Every month I ALWAYS have at least one article to ""rant"" about. VERY informative.

The last, long cover article I read was about the ""coming of age"" of robots. Oddly, not long before reading the article, I was recently pondering that question myself. What WILL we as humans DO, when robots do it all for us? The article answered my question. The ""Industrial Revolution"" 1760 ~ 1840 caused considerable consternation, posing by many, the same question I had. Sewing machines? Oh, the ruination! We adopted and lived through it...as we have ever since.

When I started reading my first issue, I thought, ""Nah, not going to like this."" I was wrong. By the time I got to the end of it, I was hooked. I renewed for for three more years, almost immediately after reading my very first issue.

They refer to the Feb 2012 issue as ""the White Issue"" with decorating ideas that involve white/neutrals - lots of examples of antiques and replicas throughout the magazine.

just a a quick sample of what's inside -

* Collecting this month focuses on match safes with photos of gorgeous antique versions.
* the center layout featuring a beautiful home done in pared back white and warm wood.
* more on whites in formal and eclectic settings.
* an article on the Coombs maple farm in Vermont with recipes for Sour Cream Pancakes with Maple-Pecan Butter and Tomato-Cheddar Strata.

I like that this is one magazine I subscribe to that I see prices quoted for little splurges that are affordable like simple/functional yet gorgeous custom stamped leather luggage tags for $13.95. This is already the second place in the issue in just the first few pages that highlights women artisans and made in the USA hand crafted goods. This magazine tries to keep things accessible to its readers, quoting sources we can use not just designer industry insiders.

187,Magazine Subscriptions,Car and Driver,$7.50,4,"I've subscribed to C&D reasonably consistently for about 10 years. I've periodically let my subscription expire for a few months at a time (mainly because I'm too lazy to renew) and have periodically subscribed to (or picked up at the mewstand) other US car magazines like Road & Track, Motortrend, Autoweek, etc., but keep finding myself coming back to C&D. C&D is clearly superior to those I just mentioned, in my opinion.

There are, however, a few magazines out there - like the UK's EVO and CAR, that may be better than C&D from some points of view (better photography, great reviews of a lot of exclusive sports cars I'll never get my hands on), but those publications are very pricey and they don't have as much information on mainstream cars you can buy in the US.

What I like: Good all around magazine. The road tests and comparison tests are generally very good, and reviews are generally chock full of tables of data (acceleration times, pricing, etc.). It's reasonably well written and, generally speaking, when you read a review you get a sense that the editor/reviewer knows what he's talking about (this isn't the case for some of C&D's competitors, unfortunately).

What I don't like so much: The comparison test results aren't always, ahem, all that unbiased (or at least they sometimes don't come across that way). Also, C&D is a car magazine - too many pages are spent on booooring SUVs and Crossovers. One other negative is that C&D just recently (a few months ago) changed their format somewhat - I liked the old format much better and there really was no reason to change, but this is just a minor gripe.

I give C&D 4 stars. Right now I subscribe to C&D and EVO, and I think that's a great combo - EVO for the great photography and articles about high end sports cars, while C&D provides good general information about more mainstream cars you can buy in the states. I doubt I'll ever not have a C&D subscription for any length of time.",positive

I recently retired and found my reading materials library was running short quite frequently, so when an offer came up to subscribe to Pop Mechanics I decided to give it a try. It has turned out to be one of the magazines I look forward to getting each month because it offers variety presented in a reasonable amount of detail. So many things that used to be done in depth have either been ""dumbed-down"" or have ceased publication. Pop Mechanics seems to hit a nice balance of enough information in their articles to answer your questions or present a fair assessment of a situation, without going overboard. I admit that some of the articles leave me wishing the publisher had done more on certain stories, but at the same time I have more than enough to go on and do my own research. And kudos to them for continuing to publish in a hard-copy format when so many (too many) others have pulled their heads back into their digital shells. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Luddite; I simply like having a physical medium to read at times. It's nice not to have to make sure my tablet is charged and connected to my network, plus the physical magazine is much lighter to hold on to when I'm reading in bed, compared to holding onto my tablet or trying to balance my laptop on my bed covers. Pop Mechanics does a fine job of getting the mechanical principles of how things work across, and it would help a lot of younger people if they spent a little time investigating this part of their lives, because one day they are going to need to know how some physical principle or property applies or works and all they're going to know how to do is download apps onto their phones.

The paper is thinner and so are most of the issues, the editorials are less inviting and overwhelmed by the ads which can be printed on paper so thick it makes it hard to leaf through the magazine. And don't get me started on the vile mix of too many competing perfume samples! I don't like many scents and a number of them make me nauseous, so I pull the things out immediately and put them in the farthest-away-from-me recycling bin. Even so, the scents still linger in the paper, especially on the facing pages, so I have to wash my hands after touching the magazine--something that cuts deeply into my enjoyment of Vogue and other mags with perfume sample ads. What's still great are the personal experience essays. Vogue has always had the best writers and the most interesting takes. Some of the fashion pages are still gorgeous, though many seem like recycled versions with poses we've already seen other models do better, or photos where the clothes can't be seen in the landscape or lighting used. With the poses, I don't know if the fault is the model's, because she has a limited range of poses, expressions or emotions, or if the fault is the editor's for choosing clothes or photos that look alike, but there's a lot too much sameness to the magazine recently. I look back longingly at Grace Coddington's amazing 1920s shoot, or the Versailles spread with those incredible clothes and stunning model with her gift for inventive poses that still let us see what she's wearing, or the Alice in Wonderland shoot--all examples of the best fashion photography available--and I hope Vogue gets a renewed jolt of the creativity, craftsmanship and professional pride that has made it an exemplar.",positive

But, when I called CN's toll free CS number the agent quickly and courteously amended my account for Vogue and set the other mag to ship the Sep issue. YAY! 5 stars for excellent customer service!

As far as the magazine itself, I quite enjoy sailing through the pages to see Vogue's take on the current styles in fashion, books, music, lifestyle, etc. While there seems to be a certain predictability and cliqueishness in the designers they advocate, I very much enjoy Vogue's presentation of the garments and the overall art direction.

Another subscription note, I found the price on Amazon for a 2-year subscription to be the best deal. However, it took a really long time for the first issue to arrive (although it came within the predicted window). What got me is that just a short time after I subscribed, and long before I got my first issue, I got a promotion in the mail to renew my subscription! If they can start sending junkmail out that fast, I would think they could send a magazine that has been out on the shelves for months (the first issue of my subscription, Summer 2014).

I hope the Summer 2014 issue isn't indicative of what we have to expect from this magazine. As a quarterly publication, I expect this magazine to contain only the best ideas, and new information. I also realize with infrequent publication and the internet, that some of the ideas they plan to include will be out of date by the time the magazine is published.

Compared to the Spring 2014 issue, this issue had a lot of ideas I had seen before, and the content seems almost exclusively from the internet - Etsy this, blogger that. There is definitely a place for featuring internet artists and makers, as well as bloggers, in magazines. I find this especially helpful when products and bloggers featured are ones I haven't seen before. It lacked a feeling of originality I have experienced with the magazine in the past. It lacked a lot of what made me like it to begin with.

That said, I also have the Spring 2014 issue (purchased pre-subscription), and that was an enjoyable read and had good ideas for projects I hadn't seen before. Also, this more recent issue lacked originality, but it also had some ideas that I can use, so it wasn't a total loss.

I am hoping this disappointment was a one-time deal and that the next issue will be better. There is still a place for magazines in the world, and I want this one to succeed!

Update: after receiving the first issue of my subscription, I did not receive any further issues. When some time had passed, I checked the magazine's website and realized that two subsequent issues had come out that I never received. When I contacted the seller, they informed me that would be unable to replace the missed issues but would extend my subscription for two additional issues. With a quarterly publication, two missed issues is a half a year of the subscription! I could have bought it at the newsstand for a dollar or two more and not had to deal with the aggravation.

216,Magazine Subscriptions,Do it Yourself,$5.75,3,"Two issues in, I’m disappointed in this DIY magazine. I just noticed that this is a Better Homes & Gardens publication and that would perhaps have hinted to me what it provides for ‘DIY.’

The first issue was okay—from it I found the courage to paint my fireplace. I went with a dark color and it looks great—the designer urged us to ‘go for it’ even if we were hesitant, which really I was doing that before I ordered this DIY magazine. But, seeing the fireplace ‘makeover’ I was more inspired to do mine. There were maybe one or two other things I found interesting, even if not my style.

But the second issue is even more ‘frou-frou’ and again nothing is to my style or taste. Not only that, the ‘DIY’ was too much beads, and these ugly patterns, and other decoration ideas that I’d never in a million years use in my house.

Further, there is not enough DIY to call this DIY, at least for me. I was hoping this magazine would have projects that I could do and with instruction on how to do them, not some designer or blogger showing what they already did to their house—if I wanted that, I’d buy a different kind of magazine geared towards home beautiful type stuff.

So this magazine is nothing that I expected and that’s disappointing. I wish now I’d not renewed after these two sample issues. I won’t be renewing after those are done unless the subsequent issues have projects or ideas that I can identify with or use or to inspire me.

Turns out, I was very, very wrong.

This magazine should have been titled ""Interior Design Ideas"". Or, maybe, ""The Interior Design Pinterest Blog"", since most of the stuff in each issue feels like it'd be more at home on Pinterest or a Blog than in a DIY magazine. At least half of each issue seems focused almost entirely on interior design, and not in a project or DIY oriented sort of way. It isn't showing you cool interior design projects that you can build or create yourself, it's showcasing how someone redesigned a room or house (stretching the DIY concept, since many of them seem to be involved with design or flipping houses or similar things).

Additionally, a lot of the ideas where the magazine actually focuses on making something, it is often a crafting idea. Don't get me wrong, I love creative crafting, and I even consider that to be among the highlights of an otherwise very disappointing magazine. However, even there, I consider craft work to be different from DIY projects. I'd appreciate the articles in a crafting magazine, but find them out of place in a DIY magazine.

If you're actually interested in making, building, and creating things, I'd hard pass on this magazine. It averages about 2-3 useful pages per issue. If you prefer looking at Pinterest and never actually building or making anything, then this magazine might be for you.",negative

We've only received 1 magazine so far. The articles and short informational passages are pretty interesting and age appropriate for both my 8 and 10 year olds. But the quality of the pictures and text are definitely not as good as National Geographic Kids. The test and pictures actually seem slightly blurry to me. The color of the pictures also seems a bit dull. Even the paper is thinner, which doesn't actually bother me but does make the quality seem cheaper.

Recently I had a pop-up saying I had saved all of the recipes I was allowed, and now must subscribe to Bon Appetite to save more….??? After several prices were offered, I finally agreed to a $5/year online subscription to Bon Appetite. Their recipes are interesting, and I suppose the price is reasonable enough. BUT, I am getting more than a bit annoyed with an absence of full disclosure up front that Epicurious, The Prep and a few other daily unsolicited culinary emails lead into a “buy this, or I can’t save information” from a source that I never asked for.

232,Magazine Subscriptions,Bon Appetit,$29.99,4,"I actually get more out of the YouTube videos put out by the BA Test Kitchen. I love all the chefs who contribute to the YouTube videos, so I was shocked at the varying pay (if paid at all) for some of the chefs which was revealed in the spring of 2020. But honestly, their commentary on the YouTube videos makes me really want to try the recipes they are using/creating, because I know the reasoning of the why, and I also get to see the ""how"" of recipes coming together. After watching those videos, the recipes in the magazine seem flat, and semi-uninspired. I am more wary of trying those recipes, I have come to understand. So, I once upon a time, would devour a BA magazine, I now get mine each month with a 'meh' and save it for bathroom time when I have nothing else to look at.

237,Magazine Subscriptions,Bon Appetit,$29.99,1,"I don’t typically take the time to write reviews but the decline of Bon Appetit has prompted me to caution all those who may be looking for a cooking magazine. I was a loyal subscriber to Bon Appetit for many years due to the reputation and great recipes. I looked forward to the beginning of each month and the new recipes, twists, spins and adaptions to classics and new recipes from various chefs I had never heard of. I planned my weekends and meals around the latest version and have a library of over 600 recipes and an additional 20+ cookbooks. I modified typical holiday meals with many of the new recipes provided by Bon Appetit.

As of the last year the magazine has lost their editor in chief and many chefs, contributors, etc. I was hoping the magazine would be able to keep their quality and deliver new and updated recipes, but that has not been the case. Rather the magazine has declined significantly. The magazine is about 1/2 the size as it was previously. There are far less recipes that their used to be and those that are provided are mainly recipes from past articles and years. There is no real original or new content and many more articles that do not contain their associated recipes or are less about cooking.

I have been monitoring for months hoping it would improve, but it has not and the lack of very few new spring/summer recipes is more than disappointing. If Bon Appetit wants to survive and remain part of the cooking landscape then they need to refocus their attention to the true purpose - cooking and providing new and innovative recipes .

Compared to Bon Appetit; Food and Wine has good food that's actually able to be cooked without buying an entirely new pantry of ingredients or searching out a specific type of pepper that nobody has heard of.
It's notably thicker than the Bon Appetit magazines but I find the content more enjoyable.

It wasn't forced or contrived, and it was interesting. Over the past several months, more and more, the content features people BECAUSE they are a certain color or race or gender, with the food element often taking a backseat to social justice politics (Marxism). The content is contrived and artificial, and the magazine becomes duller by the issue. I'm forever canceling my years' long subscription today. The final straw? The June issue was dedicated to Juneteenth; the new July issue mentions nothing at all about the Fourth of July, American Independence Day.

The combination of information, presentation, human interest stories and wit was unparalleled-- in my opinion.

I can leaf through the whole thing in 10 minutes, not feel the need to linger or stop at any page...it's uninspired and dull. Again, my opinion, of course.

Food and Wine just started coming (I think it was a holiday gift) and it's filled the void somewhat. I'd say it is a solid 4 where Gourmet was a solid 5 and Bon Apetit is a 2.

Food and Wine has a lot of interesting recipes and articles. It's got some foodie interest stories and lots of pretty pictures that make you hungry. I wish their fonts were prettier but the layout is well organized and functional. I notice a trend toward health consciousness, which I like.

I've also tried Saveur and was not that enthused. And the food network magazine is the PEOPLE magazine of food, not for reading articles but just skimming through pics. After careful consideration, I think F&W is the best food mag left on the market.",positive

I tend to order most of my online purchases through Amazon, because I have had very could results, this one however I would have been much better off to have gone through HIGHLIGHTS themselves at [...]. I ordered two magazines, Highlights for children (ages 6-12) and Highlights High Five at the same time - on September 13, 2009. The High Five magazine came as expected in beginning of November. The Highlights for Children did not. I waited and waited (not wanting to give one child something and not the other). In Mid November I called Highlights directly. They said they had never received the order for this magazine. Then I called Amazon. They gave me the Number for Magazine Express whom they sell this through. I called them. The customer service rep was very rude and proceeded to tell me it would be another few weeks for the magazine to be sent - that it could take up to 10 weeks. When asked why Highlights said they had never received the order, they said that it was actually going to be sent in bulk to them, then they would distribute. I then called Highlights again. They said that wasn't the case, all magazines are sent from them. They had received the order for the High Five, and that is why it had been shipped and received already. I then had to send proof via fax that I had paid for both substriptions and when the order had been placed. I did so, then called Amazon back, for I really didn't want to speak with the rude rep at Magazine Express again. Amazon contacted them, and they informed them of the same lies they had told me. I finally received the first issue on December 5,2009 (almost 3 months after the order and 2 issues of High Five later).

I was so jealous of the kids who had this delivered to their home every month. What a luxury. I was ready to order something else after reading all the bad reviews of their marketing practices. Then I noticed that I had ordered it last year for other granddaughters. I knew that I wasn't getting any unsolicited items from them. I contacted my son. He told me that his girls love Highlights. The four year old is especially glad to get each edition. And no, he had never received unsolicited items or had any problems at all.

I do not doubt that they engage in the practices that are alleged. The stories are too similar to discount and why would anyone lie about it. I am guessing that because the billing and shipping addresses differ we are not subject to the problem. I notice that grandparents are not complaining about the practice. It appears that because they have no billing information on the recipient they don't bother with the scam.

So I'll review this magazine with the intended audience in mind, with respect to how this magazine compares to other pop culture/Hollywood magazines.
Outdoor life magazine is great however a lot of ads in it. The kids magazines are great and a great price also. This is a great give to send to grandkids who live out of state.
First, it is true that US Weekly has changed dramatically in the past year or two. The magazine has adopted a British-tabloid style of journalism that has made it a top seller on newsstands. As a result, however, US Weekly's depth on Hollywood, and its reporting credibility has sunk to an all time low. Many of its rumors, unidentified news sources, reports from an insider, etc. are extremely fun to read, but also lacking in accuracy. With that said, readers should acknowledge that a good portion of information may be created by the writers and editors in order to deliver a more entertaining story.
Although some of the gossip-like reports may be nothing more than a figment of a writer's imagination (resembling a fan's biggest fantasy), US Weekly should be credited for its well-versed skills in crafting sensationalism. Whether a page is about Collin Farrell or American Idol, the magazine does a wonderful job of delivering a colorful page full of photographs and trivial tidbits. After a hard day's work or long hours studying, US Weekly is definitely a welcomed refreshment.
Now whether this magazine matches up to its other celebrity-magazine competitors is debatable. US Weekly lacks the great stories and interviews of Rolling Stone or Vanity Fair, but is a lot more enjoyable than People; it also suffices the cravings of those InStyle fans who like to check out fashion do's and don'ts. Overall, if it's fluff you want, then nobody does it better right now than US Weekly. The magazine's publishers don't even pretend anymore that some of its loyal subscribers are illiterate!
*** Summary: If you want substance, look elsewhere (i.e. The New Yorker, The Economist, The Nation).

273,Magazine Subscriptions,National Geographic Little Kids,$23.00,5,"This is my first magazine subscription trough amazon and I was a little puzzled with some reviews about delivery problems and delays for several magazines. But due to its bargain price I just gave it a try. I subscribed a month or so ago and was disappointed with the estimated delivery date given at the time of order which was 4 months from the time of order. To me it was ridiculously long to process a subscription, but the first issue was delivered in one month so I assume that estimated delivery was refering a safety window not to let customers have high expectations. So I was happy it came way sooner. It is a pocket size magazine and has around 20 pages or so. Very good pictures and some other activities were included. I agree with the other reviewers who say that it can only keep a child busy for a few days, but to me that is not a drawback. My son goes through it for a few days and then forgets it for a few weeks and when he finds afterwards he goes through it again for some more time. Besides, if we manage keeping the physical integrity of the magazine and have a few issues accumulate, then I am sure he will be more than happy to go back to previous ones. This is not a newspaper that would get old in a day.

Another good thing is that it has no advertisements at all. For some other child magazines, I heard parents complaining that nasty videogames and junky foods were advertised so that harm overweighs the benefits but for this magazine that is not the case, so you are safe...

The magazine could be better if it was may be double the size and frequency, once in every two months for this size of magazine is hard to understand, especially for a group like National Geographic which has access to lots of different nature photos and stories all the time.

So it is not something to depend on, but rather something that would show up in the mailbox when it was totally out of your mind and keep your child entertained for a few days or so...",positive

I would read the short articles to her and then I would summarize them in a simpler way. She'll point out ""ears!"" ""nose!"" ""monkey!"" ""baby monkey...mommy monkey!"" and she'll ask questions, ""they're drinking water?"" ""they're playing?"" It's so much fun for her and for me and my husband to go through it with her. After reading about elephants in one of them I asked her if she wanted to watch a video on elephants and I found one on youtube and so she watched a short video on it. I thought it was a nice way to supplement what she learned and get her excited to learn about nature. I plan on continuing that way when the other editions arrive.
Also, there are little animal cards with bits of information attached in each magazine that she can collect. She's looking forward to the next one already.
I will say that the magazines are not delivered in a plastic bag. They are taped together on the edges with stickers and you need to be careful opening it. Slice it with a letter opener or knife because you can damage it otherwise. They arrive a little scuffed, not in pristine condition, but i suppose it's better for the environment than using plastic and might also be cost saving.",positive

295,Magazine Subscriptions,Women's Health,$7.00,2,"I subscribed to this magazine thinking it would be about health, fitness, and above all, working out. The headlines on the cover seemed to suggest that was true, with the biggest fonts advertising things like ""flat abs now"" and ""maximize your workout"". In reality, the content of the magazine is mostly beauty (how that counts as ""health"" is beyond me) and weight-loss. Oh, the endless, endless articles about ""burn more fat!"" ""three new foods that will help you burn fat!"" ""drop pounds with this easy exercise!"" I don't need to lose weight and I found that these articles just played into my growing impression, as issue after issue dropped on my doormat, that the magazine views women as vapid, stereotypical beings whose only desire is to look good, whether through exercise (almost inevitably restricted to cardio and yoga), the ""right"" work-out clothes (really?) or knowing what dress is in fashion or what color make-up to buy. If you enjoy that sort of thing, that's fine- it is essentially one step above Cosmopolitan on the seriousness scale. If you're looking for actual information about working out and building muscle, know that Women's Health magazine is barely aware that these things exist, and when it does, it will come wrapped in the form of ""ten minutes a day to tone your bum like a super-model!"" or something equally cringe-inducing.

Frankly, looking around, it seems your choice is either a magazine that barely addresses fitness, or going straight to the hardcore muscle-building mags. I was hoping for something reasonably in-between with Women's Health, but failed to find it. If someone knows of such a magazine, I'd be interested to hear it (I tried Women's Fitness, which suffers from the same problems as Women's Health). The good news is that my subscription to Women's Health seemed to get me a good price on Men's Health, which I am switching over to because some reviewers recommended it for those disappointed with the content of WH. I'll see how that works out.",negative
