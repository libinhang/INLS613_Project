I used it after the beach and it only got most of the sand the suction stopped working after using it for a little bit so I had to empty it even though it wasn’t full but the suction came back after doing that. So, as long as you’re okay with emptying it a few times it’s a good product.",positive

3,Automotive,"THISWORX Car Vacuum Cleaner - Portable, High Power, Handheld Vacuums w/ 3 Attachments - 12v, Auto Accessories Kit for Interior Detailing",$14.72 - $71.99,5,I do a lot of driving/pick ups for ball. If you’ve ever had kids after a game or practice full of dirt and grass you’ll know what I mean when I say you’d think there was a dust bowl in my vehicle. This vacuum makes it easy to clean after every trip or when you get a moment. It is also great at pulling up the dog hair out of the carpet. Best little vacuum I’ve bought for a vehicle.,positive
4,Automotive,"THISWORX Car Vacuum Cleaner - Portable, High Power, Handheld Vacuums w/ 3 Attachments - 12v, Auto Accessories Kit for Interior Detailing",$14.72 - $71.99,5,"This vacuum works great for my vehicle. The cord is long and suction is good enough for my needs. My vehicle never gets super dirty, so I just needed something that would allow me to easily pick up small amounts of dirt and grass from my car floors on a weekly basis. This vacuum works perfectly for that. If you are looking for a vacuum to deep clean your vehicle, I'd recommend looking for something stronger. Other than that, you really can't go wrong with this vacuum. Works great and can easily be stored in your vehicle, as it takes very little space, making it easily accessible when needed.",positive

10,Automotive,"Cleaning Gel for Car, Car Cleaning Kit Universal Detailing Automotive Dust Car Crevice Cleaner Auto Air Vent Interior Detail Removal Putty Cleaning Keyboard Cleaner for Car Vents, PC, Laptops, Cameras",$7.99,4,"To be fair, I was hoping for a miracle clean. The pad on my keyboard is made of some soft-ish plastic with an engraved grid. It holds dust, dirt, and even glitter forever. I've tried various cleaning substances, stiff brushes, etc., with little effect. It was just gross. I saw an ad for this crevice cleaner, and it was reasonably priced, so I tried it, and I must say, it did a good job. While I was hoping it would magically lift everything off in one swoop, I did have to use it multiple times in small areas, followed by some digging with a sharp object into that stupid grid. And it left a little greasy feel that took a couple of days to disappear. But... that keyboard is the cleanest it's been since I took it out of its box. So for me, this is a good product that I'll use to keep the keyboard from getting gross again. No miracles, but, yeah, it worked well.",positive
11,Automotive,"Cleaning Gel for Car, Car Cleaning Kit Universal Detailing Automotive Dust Car Crevice Cleaner Auto Air Vent Interior Detail Removal Putty Cleaning Keyboard Cleaner for Car Vents, PC, Laptops, Cameras",$7.99,3,"I pruchased this to use in my vehicle to get into those hard to clean areas. I ended up using it in my dad's work truck to really put it to the test. He is working in a very dusty area with the red dirt....his truck was covered in the thick dust, so a perfect test of the product. He and I cleaned what we could with rags, but I wanted to try this stuff out on the creases and vents. It worked alright. Here are the pros/cons of the product from my initial test:

Pros:
- Ease of use: This is very easy to use. Just open it up, pull it out, and start dabbing it into the dusty areas. I found that tapping the dust to get the worst of it off before dragging it over a second time worked best.
- Cleaning: This is good for loose dust. It worked really well at removing the dust in the vents and some of the corners you could not get a rag into.

Cons:
- Cleaning: This did not remove some of the stuck on dust that a rag would have removed. I also found that getting in tighter crevices did not work very well either. It also left a little greasy feel that may attract dust or that some people may not like on their dashes or inside their vehicles.
- Cleaning the product: With as heavy of dust that was in my dad's truck, the gel got pretty dirty. I am not sure the best way to clean it, or if you can even clean it. Rags and towels are easy...just throw them into a washing machine. I'm guessing this is use until completely dirty and throw away.
- Messy: This also leaves a greasy feel to your hands. With rags, you can usually minimize this, but this stuff gets all over your fingers, especially the finger you use to press it into vents.

Overall, this is something that is a neat idea, but it really is not great. It worked okay at getting loose dirt and dust off of surfaces, but you could also get the same results from using something like tape or wrapping a small tool with some cloth and using cleaning agents. This might make a cheap, fun stocking stuffer if you want to get something that is different. Personally, I don't think I'll buy this again and just use rags.",fair

If you smoke in your car and have ash or tobacco in the lil drink cubbies or the inside for handle pockets you NEED to buy you some of these. I was so shook when I watched that stuff that reminded me of my youth when Slime came out. Not only does it work amazingly its also fun to use and is resuable. If I had one thing to say bad it's that the small print and my old eyes are at odds, I cannot read the jar or instructions on how to use it, so I winged it and it worked. I just pulled the entire wad out of the container and just started sticking into the drink holders in my car now it's spotless but since I had fun doing it the other day I'm gonna have to go get the rest done so I can post it on the ad. I still have more to do and will try and put up a lil video of how well this stuff works!!! Plus it's pocketbook friendly knowing what I know now if they decide to do what must business are doing these days in raising prices due to inflation from the global pandemic and how it's changed life as we know it, but I hope they don't cause they will still get rich on this product keeping the price where it was when I bought mine and will buy more and will stay a customer well into the future.",positive

Otherwise, it is easy to use and very effective, particularly on car speaker grills which never seem to get clean any other way.",positive
14,Automotive,"Cleaning Gel for Car, Car Cleaning Kit Universal Detailing Automotive Dust Car Crevice Cleaner Auto Air Vent Interior Detail Removal Putty Cleaning Keyboard Cleaner for Car Vents, PC, Laptops, Cameras",$7.99,4,Product is hard to get into some areas like corners because you need to press firmly and directly down into area. Also did not always pick up everything even after several attempts. Need a rag and possibly some cleaner to wipe down any shiny or clear things it touches because it will leave a film. It also will leave some bits of it in some tight spaces and can be hard to get out.,positive

Then again, it would have lasted more than one use but my weirdness wouldn't allow me to put it back in the container with all that dirt and dust and whatever else was in it. That's my bad.

Overall, I would do it again simply because it's easy to use. If you need to scrub something, this isn't the product for that. But it is a quick way to clean off the dash.",positive

I've determined that it's not something you probably want to reuse, but I'm not sure if others do. I bought it to clean the dust and dirt from the cup holders in my car to get me to when I can get a proper detail job done. I tore a bit of the glob out of the jar and rolled it around the cup holders and it cleaned it very well. Maybe someone with more patience than I would get a perfect clean, but I'm impatient and got a 4.8 out of 5 star clean in just a few minutes total for both cup holders.

20,Automotive,Rain-X Latitude 2-IN-1 Water Repellency Windshield,$13.97 - $69.97,4,"Purchased 21"" recommended for my vehicle. Easy to install- followed directions and it did what it was supposed to do. I used it for an 08 Jeep Patriot. The passenger side wiper does not conform completely to the window. I tried to bend the tip (3inches) for a better arc, but it didn't work. When the windshield wiper is on there is 2-3 inches that don't get wiped until the wiper reaches the 2oclock position. The driver's side wiper was better, but also had a point that didn't touch the glass leaving me with about 1/2"" (at 1 o'clock position) that it didn't wipe. If the wiper isn't tight to the window, I wonder how well it will do when I'm driving and bugs get smacked on the windsheild....",positive

Was also easy to install. Just have to follow instructions for the J hook style wiper arm. These are a good quality blade, so snug it’s like a squeegee and so quiet. I think they guarantee them for 6 months but I can usually get about a year out of them.",positive

23,Automotive,Rain-X Latitude 2-IN-1 Water Repellency Windshield,$13.97 - $69.97,4,"I ordered this for my Nissan Rogue, and it fits kinda, but not really well. The J-hook doesn't lock in exactly right, so it tends to slide off, which is only really annoying when trying to scrape ice. Every time I lift the arm, the stupid thing falls off. One time, we were heading down the road in a heavy rain storm, and the thing flew off the windshield altogether! But I was able to recover it and put it back on, and it's still going strong. It's an excellent blade, in terms of wiping the glass, and obviously scores high in the durability category. I will probably buy the same brand again. Maybe I'll just pick up a few zip ties to go with it...",positive

They wanted to charge me $90 to replace them. So I asked what would it be to just purchase the blades and I do it myself, they said $70.

30,Automotive,Bosch Automotive Accord Civic Crosstour CR-V Odyssey Pilot Ridgeline Toyota Celica FJ Cruiser Prius 4Runner,$3.44 - $59.00,4,"Cabin air filters are some of the most simple and easy things for manufacturer to make. Yet overwhelming, the prices are too high for what they are. That includes this filter. This beef of mine applies to nearly all cabin filters. Thus, the rating of 4.

This filter does an excellent job of capturing various debris both visible and those things too small to see. Allergy symptoms are reduced whilst driving one of my vehicles equipped with this Bosch HEPA filter vs what my allergy symptoms were before getting in said vehicles. So to me, this Bosch HEPA filter obviously works well.

Cabin air filters are only as good as your dillegence in changing them. HEPA filters catch more, so they clog faster than basic filters. And therefore require more frequent change outs. I personally believe that HEPA should not be air hosed off to extend they're life. Just change them.

I don't change filters based on a set number of miles or months in use, but by seasons and weather conditions. Spring, late Summers and in the Fall are usually hardest on filters. As is high winds during dry conditions or city driving. Cities are dirty! Wet weather proceeding spring generally increases allergy symptom generators. For best results, change your Cabin filter as your conditions dictate.

My changeout schedule is very subjective and and somewhat objective. What works for me may work for you. I change my filters based on the sound my fan makes, vs the fan setting, vs the felt air flow coming out of the vents, vs the air flow sounds I hear. If you have just one or two vehicles that you keep long term, you may develop knack for when to change your Cabin air filter with consulting a calendar.

If you don't keep fresh NEW filters in your vehicle, know that a dirty or reused filter can create the perfect media for mold. I have seen heavily molded filters in vehicles which were driven exclusively in the desert. So for safeties sake, stay on top of it. No, I am not a vehicle parts salesperson.",positive

40,Automotive,EcoNour Car Windshield Sunshade Circle - Variation,$15.99 - $37.99,5,"This item works very well for my 2013 Toyota Camry to protect the dash, steering wheel etc. from the brutal sun in the south. It also can be used nicely for our 2020 RAV4 as well if needed. Just put it in place with the silver side facing sun and black side inside the car and the visors hold it in place. It doesn't fit like a glove against the windshield perfectly but I didn't expect it to. I also works very well when the car is parked sideways facing the sun and I place it on the front and back seat. The loose areas outside the two circles do not stay in place perfectly against the windshield but you can adjust them enough to get good coverage. I do notice the inside temp has decreased considerably which is nice also. Being able to twist it into a smaller bag is nice but I don't do it much as I just move it from the windshield to the back seat. Overall I give it a 5 of 5 rating as most do. Great price, quality item and works nicely for my needs but protecting the dash, steering wheel and the whole driver front cabin area is priceless.",positive
41,Automotive,EcoNour Car Windshield Sunshade Circle - Variation,$15.99 - $37.99,5,"For reference, I have a 2008 Toyota Sienna LE minivan, and got the XL, which was a perfect fit!

I am very happy with this sun shade. The little storage pouch is thin and convenient, as well as easy to use. The shade itself is also great— black on one side and silver on the other. The two discs inside can overlap which is not only good for ensuring a snug, perfect fit when in use, but also makes putting it up / taking it down really easy. It also makes it easy to accommodate your rearview mirror and anything else you may have on the top / bottom center of your windshield. I personally have a dashcam right under my rearview mirror and am able to tuck the material between the two discs of the shade under it, and then sort of fold it over the top of the dashcam to protect it from the sun, which is really nice since this summer has been absolutely brutal where I live. I definitely feel the car is significantly cooler when I use the shade. It can only do so much, of course, with temps of 100 degrees and with your car sitting in constant direct sunlight, but again— I feel a noticeable change in how warm it is inside when I get in. Closing it back up was a bit challenging at first but once I got the hang of it, it became very easy and is fairly intuitive, though there is also a QR code on the storage pouch with instructions on how to use it.

Overall, I am very happy with this sun shade! It is light but sturdy, does the job, is a perfect fit, and is easy to store when not in use. Also priced well!",positive
42,Automotive,EcoNour Car Windshield Sunshade Circle - Variation,$15.99 - $37.99,4,"I have two of these for the front and back of my car. Sunny texas and no carport.
My frist order was good, it was packaged well. Came inside an amazon plastic puch and then the product itself was covered in thin plastic. The shield comes in a bag with a string tie.

The second order was at a discounted price and boy did they discount the quality. Im beginning to think prime day or coupons on amazon are just to offload products that didn't meet quality standards. I got another crappy product on Prime Day from another seller that thousands of ppl were happy with, and mine was beyond defective. There were a handful of ppl who had the same issue, wonder if they purchased theirs on discount too.

Anyways, the second order for this product came without an amazon box or pouch and was just the thin plastic material that the product comes in. Yikes!

Then the draw string bag that the shield comes in was just sad. The seams around the pouch had come undone, string hanging everywhere like someone forgot to finish sewing the product. Luckily the shield was fine. I almost returned it but decided I probably wouldnt even use the bag to store the shield.

I think the shield does its job and stays in place.",positive

Nothing against the company who makes them. This is actually a very good product. Very easy to fold, stores quite nicely in the back pocket of my passenger seat and keeps my car pretty cool. Even the dash and my steering wheel are cool enough that it won't burn my hands. I would totally recommend this product to others.
Also I would suggest if you order it on Amazon when you have the year, make and model of your car loaded into the Amazon garage, to measure your windshield and go with the size that's closest. Don't go off of what Amazon says.",positive
44,Automotive,EcoNour Car Windshield Sunshade Circle - Variation,$15.99 - $37.99,5,"I use it for its intended purpose, sun blocking my car windshield. It is not very substantial, almost paper thin. Black on one side (inside of car side) not at all shiny on the outside (windshield side), rather a subdued gray. I don't think it actually blocks much heat on the windshield side.
I have used it a couple of times now, in baking 90 degree plus direct sun, and did not notice much temperature difference. I used to have a shield that was shiny aluminum on both sides, with a 1/4 inch of some foam material between them. Worked great and provided a noticeably cooler interior.
Unfortunately, after some years of good use, the foam just crumbled away, hence the search for a replacement. This shield was my first try and I think it was not a good choice. I'll probably return it for something more effective.",positive

46,Automotive,EcoNour Car Windshield Sunshade Circle - Variation,$15.99 - $37.99,5,"This review is to let users know that the 59x29 inch fit perfectly for the 2017 KIA OPTIMA SX. With the sunshade the entire windshield is perfectly covered with very little to no extra material sticking out. It does say on the medium size that it will fit my Kia model snuggly, but I honestly think that the 64x34 would be to big.

I would say it would be best to use a measuring tape if you have one to measure your vehicle windshield that way you know for sure it’ll fit instead of relying on comments alone.

60,Automotive,AstroAI Air Compressor Tire Inflator Portable Air Pump for Car Tires 12V DC Auto Tire Pump with Digital Pressure Gauge Parent,$31.99 - $32.99,5,"SO EASY! it's goofproof!
The best feature is - it - does - not - have - a - battery - that needs to be charged or is susceptible to heat/cold, or worse fails when you need it most, *instead it plugs into your dash and the cord is long enough to reach all 4 tires. I was able to set the PSI just once and it remembers the setting permanently so all I have to do is connect hose to my tire valve stem and turn the unit on, then it automatically reads the current air pressure already in the tire, then fills it to the amount I had previously set. Works like a charm every time!
SIZE - it's about the size of a half gallon of milk, so it's easy to store and use! Wish I'd gotten one of these years ago. LOVE IT! I highly recommend giving this as a gift to anyone who drives a car. It's paid for itself many times over. GET ONE, YOU'LL LOVE IT.",positive
61,Automotive,AstroAI Air Compressor Tire Inflator Portable Air Pump for Car Tires 12V DC Auto Tire Pump with Digital Pressure Gauge Parent,$31.99 - $32.99,5,"I don’t like the insecure feeling of having a low tire and having to worry about where, or how far I’m going to have to travel to refill a low tire. I also REALLY don’t like swiping my credit card to pay 2.00 to put air in my tire. I extremely don’t like the insecurity of having to crouch down to my tires to put air in them, and having to watch over my shoulder for some creeper or potential mugger coming up on me. I purchased this to avoid all of that.
I used it today, and I love it. I also purchased the 12 foot extension cord, so I have a lot of cord to work with, and can reach all tires.
When you put the nozzle on your tire, and turn the device on, that will show you the current PSI in your tire. When you turn it off, and then on again and set the PSI you need in your tire, it will let you know when you have reached that PSI & then you shut it off, remove the nozzle from your tire and put your cap back on.

This thing is pretty awesome for the money!! My husband has a big air compressor he has on his truck, but sometimes he’s not around! I like to be self sufficient and be able to take care of things without his help. Tonight at the farm, we put it to use on an old farm truck that had a flat…and buddy I was impressed! Worked so easy! I’m not completely inadequate when it comes to working this kind of thing, but I’m also no mechanic!!
One draw back, I hope you’re not in a real big hurry when needing to fill that tire up!! We were down to 7psi and got to 35, but it took us about ~20 minutes! Oh well! Tire was up, I could check cattle, and I did it myself! Well, my 9 year old man and I !!
One more thing-my boy was playing with it in the truck when we were done and it’s also got one heck of a light on it too!! Didn’t even notice that feature, but that’s pretty handy!!

63,Automotive,AstroAI Air Compressor Tire Inflator Portable Air Pump for Car Tires 12V DC Auto Tire Pump with Digital Pressure Gauge Parent,$31.99 - $32.99,4,"My car tires were somehow all at 26-29lbs so while freaking out I decided to order this and see if I could pump them up at home without having to worry about driving on a highway to search for a place to put air in them.

Surprisingly this little machine worked very well! It filled up all 4 of my tires in less than 10 minutes. It did get a little warm towards the 10 minute mark but is wasn't hot enough to worry about.

I loved that the nozzle that you use to hook up to your tire stem has a closing mechanism so when I took it off it didn't leak any air like I've experience with other pumps. When I got in my car my tires were inflated to an exact 35lbs just like the machine displayed so I'd say it was right on the money and accurate.

I used this today for the first time to put air in my tire. My tire size is P245/40/R19 which should be at 35 psi (per manufacturer specs) and it was sitting at 27 psi. I hooked this up, set it to fill up to 35 psi exactly and within approximately a minute my tire was aired right to where it needed to be. I even doubled checked with my tire pressure guage. Very easy to use and came with many different tip options for all kinds of applications. I am impressed with it and it will sure be handy in the future.",positive
65,Automotive,AstroAI Air Compressor Tire Inflator Portable Air Pump for Car Tires 12V DC Auto Tire Pump with Digital Pressure Gauge Parent,$31.99 - $32.99,5,"Original review: I bought this less than two months ago, and have used it once. It was great, pretty quick to fill up tire, and so light/easy to use. Today when I went to use it for the second time, two of the wires disconnected and one of the nubs (not sure correct term) is stuck in the other cord, so I’m unable to use it again. I’m not sure if I received a lemon or what; it was great while it lasted but horrible value given uses.

UPDATE: the company reached out to me within a day of my review. They offered me a full refund or a new device. As stated in my original review, I really liked how it worked, so I chose to get a replacement. I received it super quickly and tested it out twice on my truck (4x4 so lose air when off-roading).

My 8year old junky one finally broke and needed replacing. This is the Cadillac of air pumps! The digital display glows so you can see it at night. You can manually enter the PSI you want on the display and once you turn it on it'll automatically stop at that Pressure. There is a nifty LED light built into the side of it and it is super compact. Every vehicle should have one for sure. Once my kids start driving they both will have one in their trunks. The only small change I would make is possibly making the power cable a little bit longer, always nice to have extra distance.",positive

The day I opened the box I used it to top off 2 low auto tires. It took several minutes to get the tire from 18psi to 36 and the unit was noticeably warm by then. Today I inflated 2 bicycle tires from 0 to 65 psi. I used a stop watch and it did each in under 1 1/2 minutes. Pressure read the same with my analog gauge. If this is all you need, it's fine. I guess it would be suitable for a basketball or a couple of small beach toys. If you want more (truck tires, trailer tires etc.) spend more money for a suitable machine.

70,Automotive,Amazon Basics Non-Abrasive Microfiber Cleaning Cloths for Home and Auto,$11.99 - $44.73,5,"I have autoimmune arthritis and carpal tunnel. Why am I saying this when reviewing cleaning cloths? Because one of the things that causes me the most pain is scrubbing. I am always looking for the best tools to get things clean with the least harm to me, the environment, and my wallet. These cloths are the mainstay of my cleaning caddy because they make deep-cleaning EVERYTHING so much easier!

I use the white cloths in the kitchen, blue in the bathroom, yellow everywhere else. The mircrofiber picks up dirt from all surfaces without damage. It’s great for streak-free glass and mirror cleaning. Cleans tubs, showers, grout, and tile. Gets toothpaste off the faucet and leaves it sparkling without scratching. It cleans walls without removing paint, gets dust and pollen off blinds, and is great for cleaning spills on hardwood floors. Need to clean more of a floor but don’t want to mop? Put this over your mop head and wipe things up. I keep a stack of these ready to go under every sink, and I carry a few when kayaking to wipe my glasses, mop out bilge, whatever—just don’t mix the two up!

When I have used one of these, I throw it in a bucket hanging in my laundry room, keeping the white cloths with cloth napkins and dish towels, and the others with my washable mop heads. Once a week, I clean them on sanitize with detergent and a bit of bleach. I like to hang them to dry outside for a crispier surface, by they dry fine in the tumble dryer too.

I have these on subscribe and save, with a new pack every six months. I literally do not buy paper towels now, because there is no need. At all. Did I mention these are great on stainless steel? Clean, no streaks or fingerprints. Clean your woodwork or baseboards with them too. Need to apply furniture polish? Got you covered with these! Kids cook something on the stove and leave a baked on mess? Wet one, put it on the mess, leave it for a few to soften, then wipe it up. Oh, and because it’s a cloth, cleaning wire shelves or behind a tap is easy—just wrap it around, give it a little back and forth, and done!

Oh, and if you are so inclined, take a clean one of these, soak it, put it in a baggie, put in a dab of isopropyl alcohol or hand sanitizer, and freeze. Flexible cold packs that don’t over-chill tissues for the win!

Seriously, these are great. Heck, you can even put roll them around a paper-towel tube and have them on your holder. They’ll stay put, and instead of automatically grabbing a paper towel, you’ll grab these instead.

After all this enthusiasm, please know that I loathe cleaning. That I can give some cloth all this hype for something I hate doing should say it all!",positive

- Actual microfiber. Could be used on monitors or TVs AS LONG AS THEY HAVEN'T BEEN WASHED. After a washing they might accumulate scratchy stuff from other clothes and lint etc
- Yes I know it's bad for the environment but if they get extremely dirty or get paint on them or something they can be tossed without too much guilt

Yes it can start 100% dead or no battery car jumps.

I know it's hard to find this specific information if you aren't a mechanic etc. I bought another Jump starter I won't name and the other one did not jump my dead battery. I was frustrated and pissed off that I spent $76 on the ineffective one.
I bought it because the seller claimed that it can charge a completely dead battery when they answered someone's question. I haven't used the car in question for quite some time and the battery was drained completely.
I had a Tacklife T8 and it worked on jumping 100% dead batteries but... It was stolen which is why I was looking for another one. Amazon does not sell the Tacklife anymore but Tacklife sells it on their website. I would rather buy from Amazon to be honest... Guarantees, refunds, customer service etc...

But anyway, my refund for the previous jumper went through and will be credited within the week.

Now, to the product... NOCO Boost Plus GB40... EXCELLENT. It jumped my 1.8 L sedan EASY. Easier than the Tacklife. Like there was no continuous cranking until start. It was just as if the battery is still good.
And this is from 100% dead battery.
Battery was dead as in when the key is turned, no sound whatsoever.

The key to finding one that can cold crank a dead car is to look at the instruction manuals for it online. If it mentions a forced boost mode which both NOCO and Tacklife have and a warning about it... Then that jumper can start from dead/no battery.

The warning is because the forced boost opens all circuits so if you have the clamps on the wrong connectors... The risk is sparking, fire, high heat etc. Is what I've heard/read. So, yea just color match and make sure the correct clamps are on the right connectors.",positive

Upon arriving at my car, I discovered that my battery was dead. I popped the hood, pulled out my old jumper cables and waited for some else to come out to the parking lot. No one did, so I went back in and asked security if they could give me a jump. The officer came out carrying one of these NOCOs and said that he would rather use that than pull his truck around and use jumper cables. I was open to the idea but was extremely surprised at how quickly the connection was made and how quickly my car was up and running. Afterward, I asked the officer where he got the NOCO and how much they run. He told me that they are on Amazon for about $100. He said that he never leaves home without it as it can be used multiple times before it needs to be charged again and that when fully charged it can sit for up to a year without needing to be charged again. Before I pulled out of the parking lot, I got on my phone , went to Amazon and ordered one along with the wall charger and hard shell case. Surprisingly, Amazon had it all on my doorstep by 3pm this afternoon! I fully charged it (took about 3 or 4 hours plugged into a wall socket at work). If you decide to make this purchase, I would HIGHLY suggest that you get the wall charger accessory and use that rather than plug it into a USB port.

It arrived almost fully charged, and I topped it off before using it on a mid-sized car, and on a SUV.

Why did I buy this?
Well, after I waited four hours for AAA to give me a jump at 7 pm, and by 11 pm, no help arrived, so I told them, ""Forget it, I'll get a friend to give my car a jump in the morning.""
I later learned that the car had a ""phantom"" or ""parasitic"" computer chip that drained the battery over a few days, much as if you left the lights on-the service dept. didn't figure that out at first, hence the need for more than one jump over a couple weeks.

While sometimes a drained battery may take a few jump attempts to give it a charge, and start it up, this device started up drained batteries immediately.

I can only assume that many of the negative reviews are from people who either didn't read the instructions, don't know what they're doing, or possibly both.
I had to jump a vehicle that had been sitting for months. Battery was stone cold dead. AutoZone jump box thing would only get a slight attempt to crank, then just clicking.
Bought this unit, hooked it up....nothing. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. if the battery is very dead, you have to turn on boost mode.
Turned on boost, tried again. It cranked up better than a new 540cca battery, and fired up before it even finished the first turnover.
Went to move the car, it stumbled and died. Hooked the Noco up again, once again started with a half a crank like it had a brand new battery.
After I got the car moved, I plugged in the unit to let it recharge. It hadn't even used enough power to need a charge. Just went straight to the slow green pulsing ""maintenance"" light.
Again, read the instructions. Charge it completely before using it. Charge it after you use it. Check the charge every few months of non-use. Make sure you have a GOOD connection to the positive cable or jump point, and attach the ground clamp to the chassis/block/etc NOT the negative terminal. This gives the power a more direct path to the starter and fuel/ignition system.",positive

Now the design flaws. The buttons are too easily pressed. The power button doesn't seem to be a big deal but twice now the light has been turned on and I didn't know it because it was in it's pouch and had drained the battery twice both times I went to use it and couldn't.

The second one I bought was on a prime day and the cases were on sale so purchased two of those to keep it and the buttons safe from being pressed.

The light works great but I gave it two stars because of the button.

The need to put some raised plastic around them or make them sunken or even require a long press to turn it on. I'm guessing it was bumped on something when I put it in the car which turned the light on.

Just be careful when putting it in the car or where ever you store it and check it regularly to make sure it has a good charge.

Only 4 stars on safety because of the buttons.

I do it because I love camping with my family. For years we used the 8oz liquid bottles of another brand to fantastic success. That exact formulation seems to have become difficult and expensive to find. These drop ins seemed like a reasonable and cost effective alternative. While I followed the directions on the side of the box (1 drop in per 40 gallon tank with a couple quarts of water to dissolve it) we began to notice that it was only doing half the job. After the first couple of dumps I was impressed to see it did a great job of breaking things down and making the overall job easier, watch out because it does nothing for odors. Continuing with the directions, it recommends 2 drop ins in 85+ degree heat, which we tried as we were in warmer weather. Solid call but still nothing for odors. We are fortunate that the seal in our toilet is air tight, but the smell escaping the roof vent is unpleasant.

140,Automotive,HOTOR Car Trash Can,$9.99 - $19.99,5,"With a new car, one always starts off with good intentions. This time, I'm going to keep it tidy. This time, I'm going to make everything super-efficient. Time passes, and intentions fade, faster than that new car smell. Ah, but this time, I finally got tired of using a spent tissue box as a car trash bin, perching it on the back seat ""transmission hump"" and having it slide to the floor one side or the other whenever I took a curve. Unsightly, impractical, dysfunctional.

I decided to give this HOTOR car trash bin a try. I was immediately struck by the color similarity between the ""brown"" choice on the web site and the ""cognac"" leather of my 2021 BMW 330ex. But would it fit on my designated trash bin spot, and could I anchor it there? The answers are yes and yes. With the buckled expandable strap on the HOTOR I can easily anchor the trash bin by adjusting the length of the strap and placing the strap/buckle under the open central utility bin lid. The utility bin lid closes fine with the strap in place, and I was delighted to see that I could open and close and open and close the bin lid without the strap getting in the way or becoming a nuisance. The three photographs attached to this review show how snuggly the bin fits in the space, how conveniently the bin can be located for the driver, and one of the photos also shows how nicely the brown color of the bin matches the color of the cognac leather. I'm very happy.

The only downside is that, with the bin in place as shown in the photos, it sits squarely and snugly in front of the back seat climate controls and central vents. But I rarely have back seat passengers, and so with the bin in place I just keep the back central vents closed. When I have back seat passengers, I will just ask them to move the bin and adjust the vents if they want to change the weather back there.

Otherwise the bin is as advertised. It includes a nice simple way to anchor an interior disposable plastic trash/ice bag (only two are provided), and nice flexible flaps to hide the trashy contents from view, yet make it easy to dispose of new trash. A zippered top makes it easy to empty the trash and change the plastic liner, or to adapt the HODER to idiosyncratic uses (see next).

I recently discovered that with the top unzipped I can nicely fit two big-box store orchid plants into this ""trash bin"", and the bin is secured enough by the strap that the plants are held upright and stable for the trip home (see attached photo). If you've ever transported orchid plants, you know what a challenge it can be to move them without smashing them. Even if you don't buy orchid plants, you may appreciate that this bin in a pinch may serve you in surprising ways - use your imagination!

Frankly, even if BMW offered their own $75 version of a car trash bin, I can't imagine it being any more attractive, structurally compatible, and functional than this $12-ish HOTOR product.",positive
141,Automotive,HOTOR Car Trash Can,$9.99 - $19.99,5,"This little trash can is just what I needed to keep my car tidy. It has little magnetic snap tabs to hold a 2-gallon trash bag (I found unscented drawstring bags here on AMZ) or a plastic grocery bag. The top zips open for access, though I've seen other versions with a velcro top that might be more convenient.

What makes this trash can great are the little side braces you pop in to keep the can from collapsing. It takes a little work to pop them into place, but it's worth it.

The only other thing I'd wish to change would be having a way to secure it to the floor, or some other option to secure it. It comes with a strap that can be used to hang it from a seatback or the center console/armrest, but in my tiny car, the only viable option was to hang the strap around my gearshift, which is a bit awkward.

142,Automotive,HOTOR Car Trash Can,$9.99 - $19.99,5,"The quality of this product is surprisingly refreshing, the materials match my interior, and look like real leather, the plastic inserts take a little effort to insert them and then it snaps open and looks like a part of the car. I especially like the 4 interior snaps (one on each side) that hold the plastic bag liner open. You can use any cheap trash can liner bag after you use the samples they include with the product - a nice touch. I highly recommend the product.
I had a question regarding ways of attaching the bag - not a complain or problem - nevertheless their customer service promptly replied. Given the quality of the product I do not expect any issues but I was very impressed with the fact they wanted to be sure I was completely happy (I am) with my purchase.",positive
143,Automotive,HOTOR Car Trash Can,$9.99 - $19.99,5,"The New York Times Wirecutter's blessing for this product is not hyperbole. This is one fine and convenient trash container for a car — and moderately priced. I ordered the 3-gallon Ultra size, which fits neatly behind my new Subaru Forester's center console, leaving plenty of room for the legs two rear passengers, although it might have to be moved to another location if the center seat is used.

My previous minivan had no center console, so I used a plastic grocery bag hanging from a front armrest, but that looked déclassé. The Ultra capacity Hotor trash can has a quality look as if it is meant to be there, but is also easier to use because I don't have to fish for the opening while I'm driving: The hole is firmly present so my hand can quickly find the opening, which is conveniently and decoratively covered by push away flaps.

The mesh outside pockets are another convenient touch.

The only minor difficulty I had was inserting the two plastic bands that come with it into the upper inner side channels just below the zipper to make the unit rigid. At first I thought they were too long and I was inclined to trim them. Don't! You have to bend them a lot so the ends can meet the insertion points and expand to their full length. The instructions warn you not to bend them too much, but you have to. They didn't break and there is also a spare pair.

I chose the black unit because it blends in with my auto's interior decor, but you may wish to choose pink to make it stand out proudly!",positive
144,Automotive,HOTOR Car Trash Can,$9.99 - $19.99,5,"I purchased this item based on a New York Times review, and I've been really happy with it. The container was easy to place behind the center console in my Honda Fit. The container is waterproof, the side storage pockets are useful, and the multiple placement/attachment options are great.

The container comes with some hard plastic pieces that are intended to keep the container from collapsing. However the plastic pieces are too long to fit the container. I used pair of heavy duty kitchen shears (the kind used to cut chicken bones) to cut the plastic pieces to a size that would fit.

The instructions refer to inserting the plastic ""stiffeners"" into elastic straps. However, the container - at least the one I received - had no elastic straps. Instead it had nylon straps sown to the sides in such a way that there were slots for the plastic stiffeners. I suspect that the manufacturer changed the design away from elastic straps, repositioned the ""new"" nylon straps, and did not update the manual, and did not check the plastic stiffener length with the the updated arrangement.

This is a ***really*** minor problem, and in no way detracts from a really nice car trash bin.",positive

Our local Costco here in the city stopped selling Mobile One and having to drive to any of the local automobile stores is not only inconvenient but you have to put up with snotty kids with attitude. Prices charged on Amazon are decent so you never overpay once you get the final order over $25. What makes this particular oil amazing is the fact I have a 17 year old Toyota which is used only make doctor's appointments and short hops to local places here in the city. As a result I never put more than 3k miles in the course of a year. Oil changes are performed in alternating years.....yes alternating years! Book value is insultingly low however I keep it around just for these purposes. So far it worked for me these 15 years since I retired. Can I have the oil changed by others? Yes but why pay hard earned bucks not knowing what kind of bulk oil is used when I can get the job done in 10 minutes or less knowing it's completed properly .... overtighted drain plug are avoided, oil filter cartridge isn't overtightened with a breaker bar, and all the remaining fluids are validated to be topped off.

By the end of the day when my tailbone starts to act up she’s on to her afternoon nap on the bed so it’s fine for me to have my turn.

194,Automotive,"Everlasting Comfort Office Chair Seat Cushion Pillow for Back, Coccyx, & Tailbone Pain Relief Pad",$39.99 - $58.95,5,"I have a seriously ill lady, with many major problems. She's been in hospitals now for several months, and has become extremely deconditioned. To get back and forth to doctors, when she's out of the hospital, we use a medical transport system. It's an important service, but there's often a wait of at least an hour. KF, as I'll call her, has no body muscle, no subcutaneous fat, and no padding at all. She has to sit in a wheelchair, waiting. Then there's the bumpy ride, then the doctor appointments, a ride back and so forth.

This lady has so much pain in her tail-bone, it's excruciating. She's in tears after about 10 minutes, and can hardly bear it during one of the appointment days. It's terrible! Then there's wheeling to meals at the facility, PT and other sitting events. She can't stand up, and never gets a chance to build muscles before the next medical crisis.

Why the long story? Because today, we gave this cushion a test run. KF was in the ICU for 4 days, and released for transport, scheduled at 1:30pm. They got her into the chair with the new cushion, using a power lift, at around 1:15pm. We sat for 1 hour and 10 minutes, before the transport showed up. I kept asking her, ""How's your tail-bone?"" ""Fine!""

The ride was about half an hour, then a bit of wait until she could be lifted out of the chair, back to bed. By the time I showed up, about 3 hours had passed and I didn't know what I'd find. Usually, she's in such pain she gets a Vicodin, and can hardly function for the rest of the day. Not this time!

Using this cushion, KF was about as ""normal"" as she'd been prior to getting into the wheelchair! Unbelievable! No tail-bone problems, no muscle cramping, no leg pain, no shoulder pain, and no arm and elbow pain, from trying to constantly adjust in the chair. Since she can't move much, it's very hard for her to even squirm around at the moment, but she didn't have to!

This is a superb pillow. We've had it only one day, but I can't believe how much we're pinning our hopes on something so basic. Back at the facility, I showed it to a guy who's lost a leg and had major cellulitis. His spine has degenerated to bone-on-bone, and he can barely sit in a wheel-chair for more than an hour. There's nothing he can do, but he's robust, has a solid body with a lot of padding, but has almost no spinal support whatsoever. He was astonished at how comfortable we was when we tried out the pillow.

Fingers crossed, hoping it lasts. I've rarely seen something that provides so much relief in such a basic way.

UPDATE: This is absolutely a lifesaver! Within 1 week of using the cushion, KF's tailbone was mostly healed. She can now sit for the many hours in waiting rooms, PT or other problems.

TIP: If you're using this with incontinence situations, definitely by two! If there's an issue, the outer fabric covering is easy to wash. But the inner memory foam isn't so easy, and takes forever to dry. MAJOR TIP: You can take off the outer casing, then cover the foam cushion with a 13-gal trash bag. Replace the casing, and the plastic bag isn't noticeable at all when used for sitting. However, it prevents liquids from soaking into the foam. The cushion is so critical you'll want a backup while the outer casing for the soiled one is in the wash.",positive

If you're a person with a small frame, this may work perfectly well, though gripe #1 may still be a problem.

Honestly, even after flattening out, it's still more comfortable than the Purple cushions (or the 4 other similar in style/design to the Everlasting Comfort cushion). If I could solve the problem of it scooting around my chair, I'd be content.

If you're like me and made the mistake of spending a lot of money on a high end brand (Herman Miller) office chair and regret spending so much on your seating...or are otherwise hesitant to spend more than this for what supports your body weight (esp. for work) all I can say is: don't skimp. Amazon's return policy doesn't excuse it. Pay good money for a good product...and return it if it disappoints. Don't forget to leave a review either way.",positive

200,Automotive,Chemical Guys Clean & Shine Car Wash,$9.99 - $57.87,4,"EDIT: I see now that the brush is marketed as a Carpet Brush attachment. I have raised my review from 3 to four stars accordingly. I should have seen this. But my advice to the Chemical Guys: make it even clearer, throw a disclaimer up or something, that the brush should be used on carpet only.

**second photo is of the passenger seat which I did not attempt to even clean after doing the driver's seat. It is posted to show what the fabric looked like before the brush tore it up.

First off, the product absolutely does work, and it smells fantastic. Second, they do recommend you test the product in a small inconspicuous area first, so in a way this is on me and I understand that. I used the brush attachment with my drill and used it to try to foam up the cleaner after spraying it on my driver's seat, as per the instructions. What I thought was foamy swirls of cleaning product that came up as soon as I started in with the drill brush, turned out to be the ripped-up upholstery of my seat being brushed around in a swirly pattern. This brush is absolutely way too rough for fabric upholstery, and frankly, I'd be nervous to use it on leather as well.

As I said above, I should have tested it in a more inconspicuous area first, and perhaps I should have been better able to tell the difference between foam and swirled/ripped fabric. I'm also planning on driving this car into the ground, so resale value isn't a big factor. However, I did reach out to the company directly on their website (as I was directed when trying to contact through Amazon) and have not received any response whatsoever. Mostly I just wanted to know if this had happened to anyone else that they knew of and if they had any advice to fix it or at least make it a little better... I'm not pleased that I have not heard back. But I can't fault the actual cleaning fluid -- that works well and smells amazing.",positive

CONS: I Will NOT buy the 16oz 2nd Bottle again. It made a mess and wasted solution as I was trying to spray the seats. I believe the HD Trigger was made for the 32oz bottle. I had to cut the plastic stem/tube for it to fit properly in the 16oz bottle.

I had some cheap seat covers on the middle captain seats and front with a cover for the 3rd row. I decided to replace the middle captain seat covers since i can see where my kids were stepping on their seats to get into the carseats. It wasnt fully covered and i saw shoe prints. So i got them 100 %covered. For the front row i needed something that would fit the seat as well as go over the screens attached to the back headrests. The ones prior i had to cut. Not only did these fit perfect i was able to slide them over the screens and still had a snug fit plus it covered the back of the seat completely. The 3rd row do fit well. Theres a lot of elastics im not sure where they go since theres nothing under the seat of the back to anchor them to.i did tuck them in and it was fine.

When it's all clicked together it's about 4 foot log. My old hose was the typical floppy type and when I put it on the sidewinder support it would often flop down creating a low spot, not this hose. It keeps it's form when setting on the support. You do have to take the part off that seals to the sewer line to get it to fit in the rear bumper. I also had problems getting it to fit until I flipped it around and stuck the clear end into the bumper first, I guess my bumper has a knot on the inside where it was welded and the trailer end of this hose fits really tight in the bumper.

The multiple rubber pads included helped with sizing and of course I only needed one layer of padding and the clamp holds very tight. I have ape hanger bars and mounted it high at first but the vibrations further up the bars made me reconsider so I remounted it much lower but made sure it cleared my tank when turning my bars. The locking clip is a nice touch but you have to make sure the gears are in the right place or it won't lock but that just took a second to compress the clamps tighter down on my phone case which felt more secure anyway. Hawaii roads are rough and full of potholes or unintentional speed bumps (over filled pot holes) but I'm pretty sure my phone is securely locked in place. I've always stuck my phone in my pocket in the past but I'm trying out a blue tooth speaker system so I want easier access to my phone if I need to make adjustments at a stop light or by the side of the road. Probably a waste of time as my exhaust pipes will drown out the speakers.

It's not really hard to do, but would probably be easier to install with a second pair of hands. There are silicon strips that go inside the main clamp to fill extra space. I got it done, but would have been a little easier with someone to hold those from sliding out.

I leave the main clamp installed, and remove the part the phone goes in at the end of the day. Have to share a truck, so this keeps it out of other person's way. This is pretty easy to do. Have to remember that when you're looking at it, the screw turns left to tighten from that POV.",positive

250,Automotive,Motor Trend Premium FlexTough Floor Mats,$24.84 - $49.99,4,"Update after 2 weeks.
I googled to find a remedy to eliminate the strong odor. Learned that the odor can be reduced by leaving the mats outide in sunlight. 2 weeks of sunlight remedy and the odor is reduced by 95%. I have to place my nose directly on the mats and can smell a hint of the odor.

Changing my rating to 4 stars, up from 3 stars. Didn't give it 5 stars, due to the effort to remediate the mats for 2 weeks and the fact that the seller stated that the mats are 100% odorless.

The product description says 100% odorless.
Not true.
The mats have a strong, pungent odor, the same odor one would smell in a tire store.

Went online to look up how to rid the mats of the pungent rubber odor. Search recommended sunlight would reduce / rid the mats of the odor.

If I can get rid of the odor, I'll keep the mats, as the rest of the product description holds true.",positive
251,Automotive,Motor Trend Premium FlexTough Floor Mats,$24.84 - $49.99,4,"I bought these mats for my 2012 Toyota Prius C, trim level 3. I hate the flimsy carpet mats that come stock on the vehicle because my right heel would bore a hole where I swap between the brake and the accelerator. Over time, small pebbles and debris would collect inside the divot and make it worse. I had already replaced the stock mats with new ones once already and the new one on the driver's side was completely spent after only a few years, so I decided to go with a mat that was made from some more durable material.

I like that you can cut them down to fit whatever shape you need, but I still feel like the coverage, especially for the rear passenger seat mats, is inadequate compared to the stock fitted mats.

My big issue is that both of the front seat mats don't sit flush. The driver side mat has a hump in it near the wheel well that can't be trimmed any further, and the passenger side has a weird dip near the back that makes the mat scrunch up unnaturally when nobody is resting their feet on it.

Going back to the driver's side mat, I don't know if my upholstery is just really worn out, if the imperfect fit is causing it to not bite into the fabric enough, or if the mats are just not that grippy, but the mat won't stay put. It doesn't slide much while driving, thankfully, but it does slip and slide a bit when entering or exiting. Not a huge issue, but I can see why Toyota adds in the security clip to make sure that the carpets don't slide on Toyota branded products.

Finally, these things *stink*! I've made mine for over a month installed in my car, and on hot days it smells like burning plastic in my car. A few minutes with the windows down and everything is back to normal tolerable levels, but you can always smell just a bit of the plastic-y chemical smell all the time.

All in all, it's a fine product and I will probably use them until they wear out. I definitely will look into making my next purchase a Toyota brand product just for the increased fit and the bonus of having security clips to prevent the mat from sliding.",positive

260,Automotive,CERAKOTE Ceramic Headlight Restoration Kit,$17.88 - $149.95,5,"And followed their instructions faithfully. And I even used a timer and lots of water from a garden hose for the sanding part. Use the supplied gloves, two pair in all, for steps 1 (remove oxidation) and 3 (the clear coat): there is something very chemical going on. Use masking tape around the headlight lens for all the steps. Basically, after using the oxidation wipes in step 1 and sandpaper in step 2, the headlight lens were very cloudy. Step 3 is crucial. The instructions said to apply step 3 on completely dry headlights, so I took their advice about making sure everything was dry to heart and had dinner while the headight lens dried, then I marched back out with clean, dry towel and a can of air spray to force out water from the nooks crannies around the headlight lens. (Did not need the can of air.) Then I applied the clear coat: it was like one of those miraculous transformations on those As Seen on TV commercials: the headlights were crystal clear. Let me be as clear as the restored headlight lens: they were not brand new with no time and mileage, but they looked very more like new than they were before. Step 1 probably takes more than five minutes and involved four wipes for each headlight lens, and total sanding time was 3+3 minutes per each grade for each headlight lens. Final coat was one wipe for each headlight lens. Total time was more than the stated 30 minutes, but before and after step 3 I really took my time. The instructions said to wait an hour after step 3 (which they don't count in their 30 minute time estimate): don't touch, don't use the car, and do not get any moisture on the headlights; so I set my timer, waited an hour, and did not touch the headlight lens in the mean time. I kept the hood up to avoid shaking any water on the headlight lens when closing. Remember, follow the instructions: when it says circular motion (step 1), use circles, when it says horizontal (steps 2 and 3), go horizontal. I don't know how long the results will last, but I'll note when it fails. Professional restoration runs anywhere from $50 to $200, and I notice the Cerakote sells a wholesale version of their restoration kit to the pros. A replacement lens runs something like $150-non dealer to $520 -dealer and takes a bit more expertise and time to install. Cerakote offers a limited lifetime warranty, i.e. refund, when instructions are followed
Day 2 report: overcast day and I when I looked close, I saw some fine scratch lines from the sanding. If I step back a few feet. then the scratches are not noticeable. This is a 13 year old car and I am happy enough that the headlights are now more effective.",positive
261,Automotive,CERAKOTE Ceramic Headlight Restoration Kit,$17.88 - $149.95,5,"I've been using Meguiar's PlastX polish and their headlight protectant for years, but I got tired of having to redo it every month. I read some reviews and watched a few videos for this Cerakote kit, and it seemed worth trying.
My headlights weren't bad, as you can see in the first photo, but they had yellowed and started to get cloudy again, less than a month from my last round with the Meguiar's. The first wipes took all the yellowing off very quickly, and I took my time with the 2 sanding steps. The second photo is after both grades of sandpaper, rinsing well and allowing to dry. I also made sure the edges of the headlights and the masking tape were both dry before I moved to the ceramic coating.
Now, I did mess up one side, which you can see in the last photo. I dropped the wipe halfway through, so in the time it took to refold it to a clean side, I got some streaking in the middle of the light. It's the passenger side, so I'm not that concerned, and I may give it a coat of wax in a few days, to see if I can smooth it out. Completely my fault, and the driver's side came out perfect.
Masking the lights definitely helped - I can recommend Scotch Exterior masking tape here, for ease of use and for staying in place through all the steps, even with lots of water exposure. Just be sure to move fast with the ceramic coating, and resist the urge to go over the headlight again. One coat and move on, and you should be all set.
Time will tell how durable it is, but I have no reason to doubt it. Highly recommended.",positive
262,Automotive,CERAKOTE Ceramic Headlight Restoration Kit,$17.88 - $149.95,5,"I'll have to add pictures when I get a chance to take some. I didn't take ""before"" pics, but I'll say the lights were VERY cloudy on my daughter's 328i. I previously went sanded and polished them using a drill and polishing compound and it worked ok, but the clarity still was not equal to the Cerakote kit and they only lasted a few months until they got cloudy again.

I can't speak to the longevity of the Cerakote product as of yet, but I am impressed with how well it worked. I think the key to the outcome is really being diligent with the prep work. I took my time with the wet sanding step and the final step went on very easy. I just went slow and made sure to get the full headlight coated.

The kit did such a good job that I'm going to get another one to do the lights on my Acura TL. It has the original lights and they're cloudy. I polished and sanded them before and used another coating that's supposed to protect them, but it did not last or provide the clarity that I got from the Cerakote kit.",positive
263,Automotive,CERAKOTE Ceramic Headlight Restoration Kit,$17.88 - $149.95,5,"Holy crap! I still don't believe it worked and was this easy. Maybe these headlights weren't as cloudy as some others (you be the judge). But I'm telling you it took me about 30 minutes and the results are fantastic! Others suggested... and I did, watch the little video online. There's nothing super-special about that information, but it is nice to have someone talk you through it while you watch.

I 'cheated' a little bit and used the 'Step 1 Wipes' twice - once with each of the 4 wipes on the left, then when it was done I used it on the right. Then I switched (started on the right and used the 'leftover' on the left). I don't know if it mattered - probably not.

Also with the 'Step 2', I scrubbed, but didn't feel like I killed myself. I probably could have spent more time with this... but I'm lazy. I did my best to keep things wet while sanding (broke my crappy little squirt bottle.. oh well). But again, I didn't scrub terribly long or hard.

As others have noted here and online, 'Step 3' is where the magic happens. I was happy to have gotten all the yellow off (Step 1), scratched through the protective layer (Step 2) with a few little scratches left. But those wipes on Step 3 did the trick. These things look brand new.

The only warning I would offer is to be careful when you open Step 3 - don't get them too close to your face. It's not like I used my teeth or anything - it was about chest-high, but I must have been breathing in when it opened. WOW THE SCENT IS STRONG (and burns a little). I must have done a better job with the second wipe here because I don't recall being shocked by the smell. Don't get me wrong, it's certainly not a deal-breaker... just be aware, that's all.

... and the best parts are that (a) I didn't fork over $400 for new lights and (b) the boy's mom is off my back for getting this done.",positive
264,Automotive,CERAKOTE Ceramic Headlight Restoration Kit,$17.88 - $149.95,5,"I used this on my 2012 truck and from a distance the headlights now look new. After applying the trim restorer/protector, the whole truck looks new. It does take some elbow grease to wet sand the lights, but the instructions are good, and it helps to know that the more you sand the better it will look. Apply the ceramic coating quickly and don't over think it. You can't help be get better headlights than you started with if they were cloudy.

I liked this product so much, I used it to restore a friend's 2007 truck lights that were cloudy and yellowing severely. The oxidation wipes were up against it, but I additionally used paper towels to remove the orange byproduct between wipes. The end result was a 1000x improvement, but there was still some yellow remaining. I don't know if I can blame this kit as much as those were 15 year old lenses that baked in the tropical sun every day of those 15 years.

The word online is that this headlight treatment lasts longer than the others. I can't speak to that yet, but it's lasted for several months now.",positive
265,Automotive,CERAKOTE Ceramic Headlight Restoration Kit,$17.88 - $149.95,5,I purchase this product because my 2003 Toyota Corolla was in need of some help in the light department. I live in a state with many homeless or some roads aren’t as bright as the others. I was driving to work one night and almost hit a homeless person on the road. at that moment I knew I needed to get my old faded headlight fixed. I was planning on buying brand new ones but I came up on this product and decided to give it a try why not save myself hundreds of dollars. I have to say I am absolutely astonished at the end product. I live in a cramped apartment and was able to get this done the only thing I used was a squirt bottle with some soapy water in it I got it done in 20 minutes. If you’re the owner of a older car and need to refurbish your headlights this is a no-brainer. I’ve also use their trim restore and it’s just as high-quality as the headlight Restorator. When driving an almost 20-year-old car that runs like the day it came off the show room floor why not have it look that good. This company has earned my business for life.,positive
266,Automotive,CERAKOTE Ceramic Headlight Restoration Kit,$17.88 - $149.95,5,"I bought this kit based on the number of reviews and because most all the reviews I read were in praise of this product. I used it exactly like the included instructions directed, except that I used the sanding discs longer than directed. I did this because I felt it would give a better result on these cloudy lenses. I almost feel that the first disc (red one) should have been a little more coarse grit, but they did the research for best results.
I should have taped around the headlight assemblies before using the Step 1 wipes as it would have made it easier to keep the chemical off the paint. But it easily wiped up with a clean cloth when I did hit the paint.
I did tape around the headlight assemblies before doing the Step 3 application just so I wouldn’t have to stop the process to clean up. I would advise everyone to do that. And make sure the vehicle is NOT in direct sunlight when you do any of these steps.
Overall the process of treatment wasn’t too difficult, except for the wet sanding. And as you can see in the attached pictures, the end result was great. I highly recommend this product !",positive

I'll update my review in a few months or do to see how long lasting this is. Although the process indicates no tools required it does take some muscle and time with the sanding part. Be very thorough. I followed the instructions to the letter. With one of my assemblies I can tell that there is internal fogging. So although I followed the instructions and I'm confident the job was completed well I can see that some fogging never changed throughout the whole process. That tells me that the fogging is internal. But it looks really good on outside and is very smooth. Definitely a big improvement. I just received brand new LED bulbs to the other day. So it will be exciting to see the difference at night. I'd, recommend this product to someone. As long as you follow the instructions and your thorough you'll get good results.

I told them what the problem was, and instead of being berated or given excuses I was simply told ""there are a lot of different headlights that are out there and sometimes me might have a problem."" They said that they would send me what I needed to complete the ""fix"" and asked for my amazon order number. A day later (one day!!) the product arrived and I was able to redo some of the process and now my foggy headlights look like new!

269,Automotive,CERAKOTE Ceramic Headlight Restoration Kit,$17.88 - $149.95,5,"I've seen many headlight restoration kits on the market, and Cerakote caught my eye as the simplest to use. The steps made sense, as long as you follow the instructions carefully. The only thing I slightly goofed on was the final application of the ceramic coating.

1. Make sure you clean the headlight lens to start.

2. Sand thoroughly with plenty of water. The instructions say 2 to 3 minutes with each grit, but I spent double the time to make sure the entire lens was hazy. This is important, because the final coating won't adhere to any part that's still shiny. Wipe the lens dry and check for haze. If any part is even slightly clear/shiny, sand it until it's hazy.

3. Make sure the lens is clean and dry before applying the ceramic coating. I used a leaf blower to dry all the crevices around the lens. Applying the ceramic coating is the final step. Make sure you do this part carefully and slowly, providing complete coverage with each pass.

The results will be amazing. The only part I goofed on was the complete coverage part with each pass on one of the lights. My lens has a rounded edge and the pressure wasn't consistent on one of the passes. I had to go back and do another pass with the wipe, and that messed with the thickness of the coating. It still came out great after it dried. It's not showroom perfect, but it's close, and a lot cheaper than replacing the headlight assembly! It's only been a week, but it looks good. Only time will tell how long it will last.",positive
270,Automotive,Bosch QuietCast Premium Ceramic Disc Brake Pad Set,$11.69 - $106.47,4,"These are the second set of Bosch QuietCast pads I've bought--the first set was for my wife's Nissan 350Z. Her pads were fairly tough to install due to how tight the pads fit into the caliper with the spring clips installed. However, with my 2016 Ram 1500, these pads were neigh impossible to install. They were simply way too tight in the caliper. I could force them in by brute force, but that is a horrible idea and without the pad being able to freely slide, is a sure fire way to have uneven pad wear.

After looking for answers online, I discovered a random website with the same complaint. The person on that site basically stated that some manufacturers have very precise tolerances, that do not account for the paint or epoxy coating applied after manufacture. He recommended a cheap file to file off some of the paint/epoxy coating. I actually hit the ears of my pads with the wire wheel on my bench grinder to take off some of the burrs and excess paint. After doing this, I was able to get the pads installed and they moved as necessary--not lose mind you but enough to locate and adjust themselves square to the rotor surface.

I spent 90 minutes on one wheel struggling and fighting with the pads, thinking I had the wrong clips or was doing something wrong. After the wire wheel, it came together in a cinch and the other caliper was a walk in the park.

I hope someone reads this and finds it helpful and saves them that 90 minutes it took me. Other than that, these are great, quiet and solid pads.",positive

The filter is easy to attach to any hose and the added short hose piece fits nicely into the fresh water tank opening so you don’t have to stand there holding the hose. What you don’t want to do is leave the filter attached to the hose on the city water attachment during extreme hot or cold weather. I had one burst from freezing and another hose burst off the filter from getting too hot. I detach after each refill, drain the filter, and store it inside the trailer. It is a good idea to have an extra filter handy. They do last a long time or through many refills.",positive

284,Automotive,Camco TastePURE RV Water Filter with Flexible Hose Protector (40043),$19.17,5,"I used some of these Camco TastePure RV/Marine Water Filters to create a backup water supply for emergency use. I used 6 of these Camco Taste Pure water filters; I had two garden hoses to reach the shed in my backyard. I started with one water filter connected directly to the water hose outlet on the back of my home. I joined one garden hose, then another water filter at the end of the first hose, then another garden hose, and finished with another water filter. I filled seven 55-gallon water drums with the first three water filters. I tested the water after the black charcoal color went away; I had to run the hose for nearly 2 minutes to clear all the charcoal color out. I tested the flavor to get a good idea of how the filtered water should taste. I tried the flavor of the water again after filling five drums, and nearing the end of the seventh drum; the water started to taste a bit different. The flavor wasn't bad, but I assumed that the filters had probably stopped doing the best job possible to filter any bacteria or other pollutants. I then took the filters out, started the process again with three new water filters, and filled another eight 55-gallon drums. The way things seem to be going lately, I felt it might be good to have a good water storage if the city water pumps shut down due to an emergency, like an earthquake or significant electricity failure, or maybe something else unforeseen.",positive

290,Automotive,"Roam Bike Phone Mount - Adjustable Handlebar of Motorcycle Phone Mount for Electric, Mountain, Scooter, and Dirt Bikes - Bike Phone Holder Compatible w/ iPhone & Android Cell Phones",$16.99,4,"I would not use this on a motorcycle. Your camera make break. Some motorcycles are known for having high vibrations. My rear camera broke after a month or two. Some stabilizer in the camera breaks and the camera will no longer focus and just vibrates and makes a noise when you turn it on. Look into quad lock. They have a vibration dampener. Haven’t used it yet personally but it looks promising.
I have had this mount on my motorcycle for the past year. It’s a Harley Fatbob. Today I almost lost my phone while riding. It never comes off my bike and due to being out in the elements, except when at home, it’s garaged then. Today the plastic failed and sheered off where it attached to the clamp and almost fell off. It was dangling and I had to pull over and tear it the rest of the way off. Other than that the parts have held up fine. The straps that secure your phone are a pain because they cover the buttons in the corners of your phone. If it wasn’t for that, and the fact that it sheered off today, I would have no complaints. This mount is probably more suitable for a bicycle. For the price, I’m not upset that it failed after a year. Just glad my phone still hung on and didn’t fall to the ground while I was riding.",positive
291,Automotive,"Roam Bike Phone Mount - Adjustable Handlebar of Motorcycle Phone Mount for Electric, Mountain, Scooter, and Dirt Bikes - Bike Phone Holder Compatible w/ iPhone & Android Cell Phones",$16.99,5,"I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max, and none of the options in my favorite bike shop worked well for it. I ordered this, and it’s amazingly adjustable and sturdy. I have no concerns at all that my phone is going to jump off the bike. The adjustability of the mount to fit a wide range of handlebars is great; I hadn’t realized just how chunky my handlebars are, but the widest setting of the mount was perfect for them. The inclusion of three sizes of silicone net is surprising, but assures compatibility with a very broad range of phones. I view the clamp as a nice bonus for added stability and security but I think the silicone net is the main factor in making the phone safe.

I suspect the phone would go flying in a major crash; that’s a risk I’m willing to take. The corners of the silicone net can get in the way of navigation on the phone, particularly when there’s a badge in the top left corner for an active background app. Nevertheless I like the silicone net because I think it’s the most secure mechanism I’ve seen that doesn’t require replacing my phone case.",positive
292,Automotive,"Roam Bike Phone Mount - Adjustable Handlebar of Motorcycle Phone Mount for Electric, Mountain, Scooter, and Dirt Bikes - Bike Phone Holder Compatible w/ iPhone & Android Cell Phones",$16.99,4,"I bought this because I'm always reaching for my phone to look at a GPS map and I wanted it right there in front of me. This holder does fit my phone, but barely. If the case was off, it would probably be better, but it seems to be ok. I've gone out already and the mount is secure. The phone doesn't move around (although - I haven't ridden anything super technical yet - so we'll see). It serves its purpose. BTW, because there are rubber straps that fit over your phone to keep it in place in addition to the side prongs holding it in place, it does not come out of the holder quickly or with great ease - so if you wanted something that did (say to take pictures or you're a casual rider) - this isn't it . I want my phone to not bounce around when I'm riding a rocky path.",positive

I've now ridden my bike about 10 times and the cell phone is being securely held in place. So from that standpoint, I'm very pleased with the purchase.
However, the box and its contents did not come with any install instructions. There was a reference to seeing it online at Amazon but I was unable to find it. I did, figure it out fairly quickly so, lack of instructions wasn't an impediment. There is one problem I did find. I tried to register the purchase so I could take advantage of the warranty but I was unable to log on at the website to document my purchase to put the warranty in place. I tried numerous times, but still have been able to log on. That was disappointing.",positive

I literally hit the crack and flipped onto the sidewalk. My bike went flying and so did I. When I got up, I inspected myself and the bike and we both seemed fine but what was most shocking of all was that my phone and the phone mount did not budge. They were exactly where they were before I tumbled. So if you want a sign of a secure phone mount, this is it.",positive

It's easy to install and easy pop your phone in and out. It also holds your phone extremally well.

Two minor issues:

1. The rubber holders tend to squeeze the side buttons on the phone. In my case, it squeezes the volume up button which is a bit annoying.

2. These rubber holders also interfere with using the corners of the screen. I use some biking apps and there are on screen buttons that are in the corners and can be a pain to get to.

For the price and the ability to hold the phone on the bike really well, I can get over these issues! I would recommend this mount to anyone looking for a cheap and effective way to mount their phone to their bike.",positive

Rubber straps offer extra security in case side clamps are not enough. In my case, one of the side clamps did FAIL during my last ride less than 1 month of ownership. The internal springs are held on by plastic parts and will eventually fail. I’ll keep using this since the one good clamp still has enough holding power to compensate for the busted one. Besides, the rubber straps keep it in place as well. It really was great while it lasted in one piece. That’s why I’m giving this a 4/5 stars.",positive

Even going over big bumps or off curbs it holds tight thanks to the rubber corner holders. They block the screen a little bit, but it doesn't really affect most apps. I use it with Strava or Google Maps open and the corners being blocked doesn't get in the way.

I have found that the pivot that holds the phone can slip a bit over big bumps, even if I tighten the locking ring down. Its not a big deal as I can just tilt it right back, but if you have an especially bumpy trail, it might be worth noting",positive

The issues that I have with it is that the silicone webs that they give you can be finicky and I noticed that there are three different webs to choose from so there's some messing around and figuring out which one to use. The other issue I have is that I have the Note20 and it seems like I can't find the right web for my phone because they all seem to be really tight around the phone and that causes the phone to slide down the holder which can be very annoying when mountain biking.
Overall, it works well but there might be some room for improvement with the silicone webs for larger phones with cases on them",positive
