0,Toys & Games,"Crayola Colored Pencils, Assorted Colors",$5.97 - $64.88,4,"Crayola Colored Pencils, No Repeat Colors, 120 Count
I hesitated buying these because I have the Prismacolor 132 set, and a few other brands, including the Crayola 50 set. I finally caved because this set has 120 colors & it was a Prime deal.

Crayola pencils are harder than Prismacolor so they hold a point longer. I don't have to sharpen them as often. I haven't sharpened any yet, so I can't comment on bad wood, broken lead etc.
These don't blend as nicely as Prismacolor, but they do blend. Crayola pencil colors aren't as vibrant or rich as Prismacolor. I have to press harder to get more color on the page. However, I always begin coloring with a light pressure & go over it to intensify the color.
So far none of the colors I've used have been scratchy. If you've ever used a scratchy colored pencil, you'll understand what I mean.

In the attached picture, for the hair, I blended Red Violet topped with Raspberry. I was going for an aubergine shade & almost accomplished it. My phone did not take an accurate color of my picture. The actual color ended up deeper & richer than the photo. (I gave up trying to edit the photo to depict the correct color.)
For some reason, I colored the beads first with Tickle Me Pink, when I decided on the color of the elk, not sure what it is, the beads were too light so I went over them with Fiery Rose. That color is showing fairly accurate in the photo. The greens are off slightly too.

The pencils don't have numbers, but they do have color names which can be hard to read depending on your lighting. There aren't any metallic colors. I wanted silver for the crown, but used warm gray in its place.

I thought I was going to have problems with the flimsy box, but the pencils are packaged in lift out containers, 2 containers hold 36 pencils each, & 2 containers hold 24 each. The containers have a tall side which is designed to be put back in the box with the tall side against the side of the box, storing them this way will make the box stronger. I think I'll label each container with the color names & swatched colors showing the pencils in that box.

So far I've had a great experience with this set of 120 colors. I feel they are a good value for a budget colored pencil.

1,Toys & Games,"Crayola Colored Pencils, Assorted Colors",$5.97 - $64.88,5,The box came in perfect condition minus the tape that was put on it and tore it a little when I tried to open it. The color variety matches exactly with the box so no missing colors and they work perfect for coloring! Does not include a pencil sharpener however which may be a downside for some people.,positive
2,Toys & Games,"Crayola Colored Pencils, Assorted Colors",$5.97 - $64.88,5,"My mom colors alot of adult coloring books. These pencils have a nice assortment of colors. Crayola pencils last longer and the lead doesn't break, especially when sharpening them, like other brands do.",positive
3,Toys & Games,"Crayola Colored Pencils, Assorted Colors",$5.97 - $64.88,5,I just wanted some decent economically-priced colored pencils so I ordered these. They work well. I can use light pressure for a touch of color or heavier pressure for more saturation. They blended well-enough with other colors to do shading.,positive
4,Toys & Games,"Crayola Colored Pencils, Assorted Colors",$5.97 - $64.88,4,I ordered these to go along with another set of more expensive pencils. They have some shades that my other set doesn’t have. They color nice but they’re not very vibrant. They’re harder pencils than my others and they don’t break when I sharpen them. The downside is the packaging and the printing on the pencils. It’s hard to read the colors and numbers. But overall they’re worth the money.,positive

10,Toys & Games,"Pokémon Assorted Cards, 50 Pieces",$5.42,5,"My photo isnt a great fan out picture, but my son wanted his cards so I had to take a quick shot.
I took a gamble with this purchase after seeing all the repeat cards reviews. I first checked out the most recent reviews and saw mostly positive, so I gave it a shot. $5 for 50 ... worth a shot.
Very happy with my purchase. Out of 50, we just got one double and one triple, which it totally fine with us. Obviously no one wants repeats, but when you buy those packs at the store... you risk that too sooooooo... whatever.
My son is brand new to the pokemon world and has a couple of friends who like to play, so I got this for him as a start. If he starts to get really into it, we'll get him more advanced card and packs at the stores. For now, we got exactly what they said in the description and my son is very happy.
I cant say if you purchase this you WONT get an overwhelming amount of repeats, but you many very well get a nice versatile deck. I do wish I would've gotten the 100 pack instead....next time.",positive
11,Toys & Games,"Pokémon Assorted Cards, 50 Pieces",$5.42,4,"I bought this pack for my 7 year old Pokemon fanatic. We received more duplicates than I had expected. He only got 1 fire Pokemon and no electric Pokemon. Which is what he was hoping for. Pikachu specifically which I know is a rare find, and told him so. The cards were new and in good condition. They are good quality, not cheap looking. All in all a decent buy for $6.99",positive
12,Toys & Games,"Pokémon Assorted Cards, 50 Pieces",$5.42,5,"This was perfect! I couldn't be more happy. No duplicates. Many of the stage 1 cards had the accompanying basic Pokemon in the set too. Good variety. Only about 6 energy cards and 5 trainer cards, the rest were all pokemon. Perfect!! Will be purchasing again. Can't believe what a great value this is compared to what they offer in the stores.",positive

If child's hand touches one animal while finger is pointing to another, the book may give info on the animal the child isn't actually looking at, but that is to be expected with how the book functions. Long battery life. Has carrying handle. Not too heavy for a one year old to carry if they wanted. No tiny parts popping off. Pages are thick durable material, not tearable. Easy to turn pages.

The volume is lower than VTech.

80,Toys & Games,"Play-Doh Modeling Compound 36 Pack Case of Colors, Non-Toxic, Assorted Colors, 3 Oz Cans (Amazon Exclusive)",$24.24,4,"I bought this Play-Doh for a hands-on activity with my 6th graders. For my purposes, the Play-Doh was a great value and came brand new. The colors are vibrant and the dough itself is pliable, not dried out at all.

The only problem you might run into is that there can be lots of repeat colors. Out of the 36 cans, only 14 weren't repeated colors. I've seen a few reviews mention they had the same problem on varying levels. I'm not sure if there is a reason for the inconsistency, but I do wish they mentioned it prior to buying.

If repeating colors don't bother you, this is a great product! I might buy from the store or a smaller case if you are concerned about repeat colors.",positive
81,Toys & Games,"Play-Doh Modeling Compound 36 Pack Case of Colors, Non-Toxic, Assorted Colors, 3 Oz Cans (Amazon Exclusive)",$24.24,5,"What I think of as the standard size of Playdoh is a 4oz container. These are noticeably smaller at 3 oz, but still a decent size.

There are 36 containers, but they are not 36 unique colors. I found that some had three of the same color, some two, others one. In the picture, they are stacked according to color. Singles stand alone, doubles and triples stacked. I imagine it's just a random gathering of colors.

Pros: The kids love the variety. I only pull out 6 at a time, so they use those (of course they get mixed right away) when those are drier and less fun, I'll pull out six new ones. So far I haven't had any trouble with the ones in storage drying out.

Cons: none",positive

90,Toys & Games,SHASHIBO Shape Shifting Box,$24.90 - $299.00,5,"This fidget box is better than any fidget item I've bought yet! I've had it for 4 days and have probably messed with it for about 6 hours.

Good: manipulating it until shapes *click* into place is very satisfying.
Bad: many of the obvious shapes I have made where all sides are touching flat do not magnetically stick together. Some of the coolest shapes don't stay, so they're either unintentionally cool shapes or the magnetic system has a huge design flaw.

Good: the designs are cool. The paper is thick.
Bad: I'm starting to see some white lines develop where the paper gets the most amount of pressure. Also, it takes a little more than minimal effort to pull this apart from the original cube form, so one set of corners is wearing.

I think that $25 is an absurd price to pay for this! ABSURD! I only bought it because I had gift card money. I would like to buy more because you can join them and make even bigger shapes, but it's not happening for $25 a pop. I don't regret my original purchase though, I really like this item.",positive

Neither of these seem to be true. I do think it will become easier with time, but in the beginning you have to be very careful not to force the pieces in a way that might cause damage, and figuring out how to align two hinges so a part can be flipped to the next configuration isn't always trivial.

It has a major design flaw in that you have to at least partially remove the inner pillow to inflate it. Unfortunately, once it's fully inflated, it's impossible to get it back into the sleeve. I'm not entirely sure whether it's the plastic mesh part of the cushion sleeve and the cushion itself getting ""caught"" on one another or if the edges of the cushion snag. Either way, I had to deflate it quite a bit to get it to fit and then had to somehow maneuver the fabric to get to the inflation port to finish blowing it up.

Review summary (quick read)
Review update (4-13-2021)
Full review (long read)

Summary:

This review might save you a lot of time researching balls, but here's the summary if you don't want to read the full review... For 4.0+ play consider the Dura Fast 40 when preparing for certain tournaments, but expect only about 2 games per ball, which is quite annoying in my opinion... for 95% of players, definitely go with the Franklin X-40 (except when preparing for a Dura only tournament of course). If you just want the ball to last and last year after year and don't care at all about egging or quality of play consider the much softer and much slower and much bouncier Onix ball. The Onix ball is so soft that I can't recommend it for typical play, but it is actually an excellent choice when introducing new players to the game and it is often the preferred ball in 65+ play if mobility becomes a common issue because extra bounce = extra time to get there, but in my area many older players seem to play the X-40 just fine.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Update: 4-13-2021:

Popularity: Almost everyone in my area is playing the Franklin X-40 in every park. I finally saw a Dura in play yesterday, but it's been a long time! Outdoor tournaments in my state are now about 60% X-40 and about 40% Dura (Washington), so even in tournament play the Dura seems to be going out pretty quick.

Seasonal durability of X-40: for the first year I don't think my group cracked a single X-40 (despite having a faster paced game), but using that same batch of balls this Spring, they've all been dropping like flies so now my 1 year old batch of X-40's probably isn't much more durable than brand new Dura's (very annoying to deal with those cracks). I just bought new X-40's yesterday and I'll be discarding the few X-40's that are left from last year when the new stock arrives. It will be new X-40's for me once a year from now on assuming quality doesn't slide... fresh manufacturing is apparently very important, so hopefully Franklin will keep their runs moderate, and maybe that's what Dura did wrong.(?)

Full review:

This review will focus largely on the physical & quality comparisons between the Franklin Outdoor X-40 pickleball and the Dura Fast 40 pickleball, but I'll also give a summary of my impressions from the mouth of experts and supplement also by my own amateur impressions and measurements.

Dura hole specs: 16 drilled holes @ 0.325"" & 24 drilled holes @ .264""
Franklin hole specs: 40 drilled holes @ 0.288""

Both balls have 40 holes with an average hole size of 0.288"", but the Dura ball has a far more randomized hole pattern. I personally didn't notice any difference in spin characteristics or any notable advantage to the randomized hole pattern of the Dura.

Franklin weight: 26g
Dura weight: 25g

Both balls are rotationally molded in one continuous piece so the seam is just as strong as the rest of the ball on either ball... the appearance of a seam is on the outside of the ball only but the visual molding mark is not actually separated in any way in the middle of the ball and the inside of the ball will likewise appear 100% seamless on either ball, so no true seam exists (both balls are true ""1-piece"" balls). The Dura ball has much smoother molding marks w/ no plastic flashing like the Franklin... this is primarily cosmetic but quality in this regard definitely goes to the Dura.

Subjective color preference: in the shade I think the Dura ""Neon"" color looks better (see pic), but in typical full sun the green tint looks dingy on the Dura ball in my opinion, and I feel the Franklin ""Optic Yellow"" is a crisper color that's probably a little more visible. These are the only 2 ball colors I have to compare. I would prefer more dye to be used for a green ball so it still looks green in full sun because in my experience with disc golf and ball golf neon green is the most visible color and neon pink is good too... with these 2 options I'd pick the yellow... the green tint on the Dura is so subtle in full sun it ends up looking more like a dingy yellow rather than a green. A more apples to apples comparison would be Dura's yellow option but I'm pretty confident Franklin would win that contest also based on the notably higher translucency in the plastic used by Dura. Color: Franklin wins.

Franklin X-40 country of origin: China
Dura Fast 40 country of origin: Vietnam

- - EXPERT INSPIRED IMPRESSIONS - -
From what I've gathered, expect much longer play per dollar out of the Franklin and expect very little life out of the Dura. Dura's are supposed to be a little harder/better/faster, but they often only last a few games based on everything I've read and heard. For older players consider the Onix over either of these balls... softer balls bounce higher and hit slower which allows more time to get to the ball for longer rallies... the Onix seems to be the favorite for play in older aged groups.

Based on expert advise from the ""pickleball kitchen"" youtube channel...

Best performance award (fastest, hardest): Dura Fast 40

Best Value (also w/ great performance): Franklin Outdoor X-40 - - - except high level players should opt for the Dura due to tournament requirements (note: this observation may be outdated... check tournaments in your state to verify what local tournaments are still using the Dura in your area and which tournaments have switched to the X-40)

Longest lasting, but soft and bouncy: Onix

Note: I have not seen a single outdoor tournament publish the Onix as their ball.

My personal recommendation for most players based on a lot of reviews and some research and a close look would be to skip the Dura and go straight to the Franklin X-40 until you're playing tournaments... if/when you advance to the level of playing serious tournament play I don't think it would take long to transition muscle memory and power from the Franklin outdoor ball to the Dura ball and a lot of money and annoyance can be saved w/ the Franklin over the very brittle Dura... Franklin X-40 balls don't last very long either (according to some... possibly old stock), but compared to the Dura it's a notable improvement strongly worth considering even if you're a quality buff like myself.

Manufacturing quality: Dura wins

Material durability: Franklin easily wins and Onix lasts much longer still if you don't mind a notably slower game (more similar to indoor) and more egging.

Quality of play: Mixed... many elite players prefer the extra speed of the Dura, but I prefer the consistency of virtually everyone using the same ball and even more notably, I'd rather sacrifice just a little speed to get the higher consistency / predictability / reliability of an uncracked ball and I find it distracting to look for cracks all the time.

Value (w/o sacrificing much): Franklin

Despite the long read, I'm hoping this helps the reader save some time in selecting a pickleball, especially for players new to the game.",positive
111,Toys & Games,Franklin Sports Outdoor Pickleballs - X-40 Pickleball Balls - USA Pickleball (USAPA) Approved - US Open Ball,$7.88 - $352.49,5,"For those who were like me, new to the sport (which is many of you), I tried a few different ball brands. This ball is the most durable, solid, performing ball I have used. All the people around me seem to have gravitated to this same opinion which has swayed mine too. Yes, we have broken a few pickleballs in our play, but these hold up better than the rest of them and feel better than the rest of them, right down to the bounce and ball activity. Just feels like a better product than all the others we tried.

If you are just getting into Pickleball and looking for some balls to use for outdoor use, I highly recommend these to be your top choice. Now that I give it such high praise, I wished Franklin would give me some balls to try out for free (wink wink). No, they don't sponsor me in the least. I bought and paid for the ones I am using.

I'm glad to see they offer this ball in different colors. I wished they offers a multi color pack of some sort though. Depending on where you play, and depending on the people you are with, and depending on the lighting, the different colors matter for ball visibility. I say people you play with -- I have a couple friends who are partially color blind. Sometimes some colors of the balls blend in with the court and you can't see them. Which is why I bought the pink ones. It seems to clash best with the courts I play on and is very visible. Color matters for sure.",positive
112,Toys & Games,Franklin Sports Outdoor Pickleballs - X-40 Pickleball Balls - USA Pickleball (USAPA) Approved - US Open Ball,$7.88 - $352.49,5,"So far with limited beginner to intermediate payers using these balls, them seem to be quite good. They have a nice pop when hit, they seem durable. There are no real power players that have been smashing them across the net so far but for more casual play they've worked out just fine.

If you order the three pack, they come in a tennis ball type tube that helps them not get crushed or bent while carrying them in a backpack. It makes them easy to store and keep track of. The larger packs may or may not come packaged that way, I can't tell.

Overall, these seem like great balls with somewhat limited use among beginner to intermediate players so far. At under $7.00 for the three pack on Amazon, that seems like a very good price.",positive

But when I order 100 of some item, I expect to receive 100. Instead, I received 99. The point of buying pickleballs in bulk is that it costs less per ball. If you don't receive the number of balls you paid for, then the value of buying in bulk is diminished. I recommend buying these balls, but buying them in smaller quantities, such as 12. It's more likely that you'll receive the number of balls you actually ordered. I would also note that Amazon provides no way in the ""Return/Replace"" process to indicate that fewer items were sent than were ordered. The items aren't defective, and I didn't receive the wrong product, and I don't want to return 99 balls so they can send me 100. But apparently quality control in bulk packaging isn't terrific.

The toy doesn’t make a single sound, even when switched on, so we thought it needed to be charged, and only figured out the issue after: the sounds start once you pour the “potion” (jar of water) into the cauldron. The little receptors detect the water and begin the process. There’s no need to worry if you don’t hear a sound before that.

2. The “create” mode always has 7 cycles, starting with the potion/water. Add an ingredient, stir until you hear the tapping sound, then tap with the wand three times. That’s the cycle, and after 7 cycles, the mist begins and the magical reveal happens.

3. It doesn’t really matter if you add ingredients or not. Once the 7 cycles happen, the cauldron mists and reveals, regardless of whether you added the ingredients or not. The only thing required to start the cycling is the “potion” bottle of water, and you can just stir and tap without any other ingredients just the same. This is great! It means the toy has unlimited playability!

4. Once the little magical mixie is revealed after the first use, you can keep using the cauldron to reveal other things. We told my daughter that the special ingredients were mixed into the magical mixie, who now has the magic to help make anything she wants. There’s a little pink box (a little larger than a deck of cards) that snaps into the bottom of the cauldron, and that is how you can “create” anything you want! My daughter has conjured rings, small toys, and even cash for her brothers! Just put the item in the pink box, snap it into the bottom of the cauldron, turn the reset key, and add the potion/water. The magic happens over and over!

5. The “create” mode has a mist that helps hide the mechanics of the reveal, and the toy says the mist will work about 5 times. It comes with one mist refill, and you can buy more mist bundled with other spells. The cauldron is just a fog machine, and I am pretty sure regular fog liquid will work in it. I haven’t tried refilling yet, so I’m not sure how difficult the process will be without using their special refill bottle, but I’m going to try. If regular fog machine liquid works, there’s really no need to buy extra accessories at all. Simply refill with fog machine liquid and follow the 7 create modes using the potion/water bottle only.

6. The cauldron also has a “spell” mode which is just for adding potion, ingredients, stirring, and wand tapping. There’s no mist and no reveal, and the play continues as long as the child wants. That mode also won’t require any additional refills, though they do sell them and I bought one set. My daughter has not used that mode yet because the “create” mode is plenty long with 7 cycles of mixing and tapping, so she hasn’t felt the need to just do the stirring and tapping alone. She really loves the reveal!

7. Lastly, I want to give a shout out about the little mixie toy that comes in the cauldron on the first reveal. It us absolutely adorable! It makes cute sounds, is not too loud, and has several fun features! Using the wand, if you tap the gem on the mixie’s head once, that’s “spell mode” and the gem turns purple. Tap twice with the wand, and it’s in “wish mode” and you can ask for a wish and it will turn green if the wish is granted. If you hold the wand to the gem for a few seconds, the mixie will go into enchantment mode which helps/interacts with the cauldron and is adorable. All that magic uses the mixie’s magical energy, so it can be “refilled” by nurturing/petting, or letting the mixie rest. What an adorable toy!

In all, my hat’s off to the creators of this toy. They hit every mark, from originality, to playability, to cuteness. My daughter loves this toy and we are very happy with it!",positive
141,Toys & Games,Magic Mixies - Magical Cauldron,$7.99 - $138.61,4,"Honestly, my children love the cauldron and the mixie itself. It is not one time toy for us. They are playing with mixie and take him everywhere with them. He is like a little pet for them. First, i bought a pink one for my girl, then my yonger one wanted his own mixie, so we bougt him a blue one. Blue mixie's diamond located on his forehead suppose to respond to a magic wand's tapping. And it didn't respond very often. It frustrated my son a lot. His sister's mixie worked just fine but his didn't respond. I went on the internet to find out what ks wrong and figured out that blue mixie's diamond has to be tapped only at the top of the diamond shape. It is too precise for a little child. I think the whole diamond shape has to be with a sensor, like in a pink version. Anyway my son likes his mixie and now I'm teaching him to tap the specific area... hopefully he'll be patient enough to get used to it.",positive
142,Toys & Games,Magic Mixies - Magical Cauldron,$7.99 - $138.61,5,My kid loved this. I think she likes more of the making spells and potions part better than the included pet. But you can use it again and put other trinkets in the box under the flip part.,positive

144,Toys & Games,Magic Mixies - Magical Cauldron,$7.99 - $138.61,4,"I figured it would be a one off toy tbh. My daughter def enjoyed the first experience with it although the spell seemed to proceed on its own if u took too long so we kinda had to rush it, having everything open and prepared is the way to go. When the spell finishes and you get the fog which we all thought it was cool till the smell hits u, its not that bad but it definitely produced some shocked laughter and the opening of a window. The toy inside is ok but not real cuddly as it has hard plastic hands, feet, And face. Its actions with the wand are decent but forgettable. It comes with a case to do more spells and reveal other toys which is cool. I'm happy and surprised my daughter is still entertained with the cauldron which can be activated not only w/o fog if preferred but with minimal water as u only need to get two metal nodes wet. Also if your a DIY'er u can easily produce many potions and effects yourself. My only small complaints about the cauldron is how many steps it takes to cast spells after the initial toy one ""wish there was a 3-4 step quick spell instead of the 7 step reg only"" and the square grid in bottom of cauldron which cant be wiped very easily to dry ""although unscrewing the bottom to dump liquid is easy"". Overall its a great idea but the toy could easily be replaced with more lights/effects of the cauldron and more spell ingredients. I cant believe i've had to write cauldron this many times and i doubt i'll ever beat this record again",positive

I would like to continue to buy this hilarious fun Kinetic sand, as the colors pretty quickly got all mixed into basically pretty gray.

210,Toys & Games,"UNO Family Card Game, with 112 Cards in a Sturdy Storage Tin, Travel-Friendly, Makes a Great Gift for 7 Year Olds and Up",$10.89 - $14.99,5,"Remember when families and friends actually played board games, and card games? Instead of a living room with no conversation, just a bunch of people tapping and swiping their phones? Well getting this UNO set can help you relive some of the magic from the good old days. When everyone actually had fun and interacted with each other.

Believe it or not, I forgot how to play UNO. Which is weird, considering how much I played it when I was younger. Even as a young adult. But just like riding a bike, you never really lose it. Open the tin, break out the cards and the rule sheet. And in a minute, it all came back. So easy to play, that even toddlers can participate.

BONUS TIP: HOW TO GET EVEN THE SMALLEST KIDS INVOLVED

So Mattel recommends that kids ages 7 and up can play. But any kid 4-6 can most likely grasp the basic rules, as long as they can recognize numbers. The catch is that it may not hold the attention of a five year old all that great. But there's a way that you can still put the UNO cards to good use, while enjoying some bonding time with your little ones. Here's what I figured out, after a couple of games of UNO with our Little Girl....

Make it a memory game. What I did was go through the cards, and picked out two identical ones for different numbers/colors. So two green 5 cards. Two red 4 cards. Two blue 2 cards. Two yellow 7 cards. I tried to avoid sixes and nines. Basically take eight to twelve cards in total. Then place them in two to three rows, face down (UNO side up). I'd ask our Daughter to flip a card over. Yellow 7. Okay, now try to find the other Yellow 7. And she gets to flip over another card. If it's not the right one, I let her know that was a really good try. Now let's flip the cards over, and try it again. If she gets it right, I congratulate her, and she gets so excited. This way, she can play a simple game that also helps her work on her memory skills. So she can remember where certain cards were, and match them up. When she does well with six cards, I bump it up to eight cards. Then ten cards. It's simple, but fun for the smaller kids that may lose interest in actually playing UNO. And she still gets to have fun with the rest of us.

There are no negatives about this set. The only thing that could have possibly been improved, is to have made the tin a tiny bit more travel-friendly. The two stacks of cards are held in plastic, inside of the tin. But it seems like they could have simply made the tin much smaller, and still fit the cards in. Making it a bit easier to just stick in your pocket. That's not a dealbreaker, just thinking out loud. Otherwise, the quality of the cards and tin are both great.

Look. It's ten bucks. That's it. People spend more than that on two iced coffees, or a drive-through at a fast food place. But those are things you only get to enjoy once. Whereas you could use these cards in this tin for well over a decade. Plus you can make it a family tradition, or have fun when friends come over. It's advertised as a kid's game. But truth be told, we played it more in our dorm's game room than I ever did as a child. UNO never gets old. Why put it off? Add it to your shopping cart. You've got the ten bucks to spare, right now. Check out. It will show up at your home in as soon as a day, if you have Prime free shipping. And you can take that ten dollars, and turn it into million dollar memories with your family. But you can't do that, if you don't order it. So buy a set today, you'll be thankful you did.",positive

We spent two weeks at their house this summer visiting, and our teenaged son played with them EVERY DAY! My husband was even down there playing with them too. I couldn’t resist. We had two sets waiting at our home when we returned from our visit. I can say the’re for the grandkids that visit one time per year😉 I asked my sports loving, video game playing, typically would choose legos teenager why he likes them, and he said, they’re just so satisfying😂 I also found out that when my son and I were gone for a weekend recently that my husband played with them while we were gone😂 Buy them, fun for everyone!!",positive

I have other kids and they love to play with it too, so it's fun for all ages (under 10 maybe). The magnets do what they should but don't expect them to be neodymium strong. The structures will hold in a reasonable construct.

This set is probably all anyone needs. I think the larger sets are far too big. You can save the box and store it, but I would maybe suggest buying a basket or case that fits your needs.

It's tough enough from what I can tell, it's thick plastic. I have concrete floors and they've yet to break as they've fallen. I'm sure you can break them, but it seems like a pretty durable high density plastic or at least nothing cheap.",positive

I gave it a try and I am glad I did. These are stronger and more durable. The magnets are thicker and longer, so the blocks stay together better. The other brand, when my son builds something he can't pick it up and ""play"" with it. These you can. We have come to play a game where I build a tower and he knocks it over. Depending on the animal trying to knock over the tower, he can't do it on his first swing thanks to these blocks. Save a couple bucks and get these over the other brand to start.",positive
