6,Digital Educational Resources,"Spectrum | Language Arts Workbook | Grade 2, Printable",$8.99,5,"My son is 1st grade, and I started this book after Spectrum Reading grade 1. I make him do half page per day since he does not like writing. Slow, but moving along. We are at page ~30, It has thorough review of language with some writing practice here and there. Of course, it involves reading practice. Since my son is very slow for writing/reading stuff, this book works best for him. I don't need separate workbooks for writing/ reading/ grammar stuff. This is one for all in language subject, I think.

Being a math wiz, I have no issues using this book as a guide for summer time practice for my kids. I know not all parents are math champion and need to review the work themselve before teaching it. This book will mess with you. Common core was created to lower standards so low anyone can pass it and somehow that didn't happen. The book is called spectrum. Stupid me!!

But once we crossed that hurtle, they did well. They enjoy creating the interactive notebook pages, and it's great to have these to refer back to when we touch on the subjects again. I especially liked being able to have them refer back to the steps for different processes when they were working independently. I suggest writing out whatever you can have them write out BEFORE gluing the paper down, because the glue makes the paper soft and more difficult to write on.

61,Digital Educational Resources,"Spectrum | Language Arts Workbook | Grade 3, Printable",$8.99,4,"I got several of these Spectrum Workbooks for my daughter at the start of the school year. We had to do some catch up because she was behind on certain skills (like writing) after distance learning last year and not practicing them enough.

There is not too much writing in this book. It’s a school book, of course there is writing. Writing is a crucial part of education from kindergarten to college and beyond, so I can’t imagine why that would be a problem for anyone.

My only real complaint about this book is that they don’t provide enough lines for kids to write on. If even your neat computer type takes two full lines, why would you expect a child to be able to fit all that on one line? My daughter was trying to squeeze in extra words beneath the line and on the sides when we started, but we have given up. Now I make her tell me what the full correct sentence is aloud, and write as much as she is able to fit on the line and then stop. This book would’ve been five stars if they used common sense when it came to providing adequate space to answer questions.
Still recommended, just be aware you may need to either use extra sheets of paper or improvise like I did. As long as she knows the correct answer, I’m not too worried about her not finishing it on the sheet, but obviously I would prefer that she be able to get the full writing practice of finishing the whole sentence.",positive
62,Digital Educational Resources,"Spectrum | Language Arts Workbook | Grade 3, Printable",$8.99,3,"We purchased 9 of these Spectrum books (3 Reading, 3 Language Arts & 3 Writing, Grades 6, 3, &1) and we ended up returning all of them, except for Spectrum Reading, Grade 1. We started homeschooling on our own after the schools closed down due to COVID-19. I bought these books as a way to help the kids round out their school year since the public schools were in a scramble to adapt to online learning. While I love their set up, it required too much daily writing. We bought 9 of these books so this review is going to be copied and pasted on to each one.

If you have a reluctant writer or are planning on buying several different Spectrum workbooks for one child, then I will warn you that the workbooks require a lot of writing. A LOT of writing. If you do love the layout of these books, then I would suggest that you alternate which ones your child works on in a single day. My oldest daughter (6th grade) is not a reluctant writer and even she dreaded having to do these books. So if you want to try them out I suggest only getting one at a time and doing only a page a day. A lesson is generally 2-3 pages. If you have a reluctant writer those 2-3 pages will take over an hour to complete. If you child has no issue with writing, then they might be a good fit. Or if you are just wanting one workbook to help your child brush up on certain skills it can be a great choice.

I also noticed the the workbooks seem to stay on the same topic no matter which grade level book you are working out of. So if the 6th grade book was on a lesson about pronouns, then the same lesson number would also be about pronouns in the 3rd & 1st grade books. So this can be helpful if you have multiple children and want to keep them on the same lesson idea. Just be aware that while many line up exactly there are a few off here and there.

The only one of these workbooks we enjoyed is the Spectrum Reading, Grade 1. There is little to no writing required in the book. The first half is an ongoing story about Little Duck. So you read three story ""clips"" and then ask your child the questions written below the clips. This is normally only a few minutes long, depending on how talkative your child is when it comes to the answers. The other side of the lesson generally has 1-3 photos in 3 rows and the directions are as simple as circling what goes together, number the sequence, write the beginning sound, write the ending sound, identify the cluster, etc. Very little writing. We haven't yet gotten to the second part of the book, but it looks like it is going to be longer stories with comprehension questions. I can update my review once we hit that part.

If you need ideas for what else to look for in case you decide against these workbooks: We ended up switching out our 6th grade writing for an actual writing program (Essentials in Writing), our 3rd & 1st grade writing book was switched out for Writing with Ease (available on Amazon, highly recommend if you have reluctant writers). Our 6th grade language arts was switched out for the same program she does for writing. The language arts for 3rd &1st grade was switched out for Grammar Galaxy. Our 3rd grade reading workbook was replaced with 180 Days of Reading, 4th Grade (same comprehension workbook, but the answers are in multiple choice form instead of writing out long answers). Our 6th grade reading has been replaced for now with Evan Moor's Greek and Roman Myths Literature Pockets (also on Amazon).",fair

65,Digital Educational Resources,"Spectrum | Language Arts Workbook | Grade 3, Printable",$8.99,4,"We've used Spectrum's Science workbook for our homeschool and we think that's an alright book for bits of information. This Language Arts workbook though is pretty great at introductory lessons to the different parts of Grammar, Mechanics and the usage of them. I think this will definitely be a great supplemental resource for any LA Curriculum, but not as a core. There's not enough in each lesson in my opinion for that but the book does say it's great for summer learning and practice. Same for the Science book.

I've included pictures to show a little bit of the workbook and what's included in the Table of Contents. The pages are colorful but not too disctracting and there is a wonderful layout for all of the answers in the back of the book.

Each lesson is a 2 page spread with information of the topic first and then going into activities/questions.

The Writers Guide section I thought was a really great resource and they could definitely work to have your kiddo use to add more writing pieces instead of just filling in questions or doing the activities.

However, language art has been a bit too much for my son since he is not so interested in language. It took ~ 9months to finish this one. So, I wanted to try a different workbook, and got brainquest grade4, and realized Spectrum language art is still the best one for the reasons I listed already. For grade 5, I will probably try Spectrum reading instead of language art. But I would recommend one to try Spectrum language Art once during grade 2 to 4.

71,Digital Educational Resources,"Carson Dellosa | Interactive Notebook Math Workbook | Grade 3, Printable",$7.49,4,"These is a great starter resource for teachers wanting to start interactive notebooks. Includes a good section on getting started, ideas for notebook uses, grading rubric, page to plan your notebook etc. The ideas are easy to implement but do take time. The time put into getting the notebook setup is time consuming but if you are doing them for several subjects the students get the hang of it quickly and the process moves along faster. The more you do them, the better the students and teacher get at utilizing this tool. I suggest purchasing a grade up and down. Some pages are a bit repetitive up or down a grade but this helps to differentiate for students within your classroom (especially in Science). I found the pages for Rocks easy to incorporate and differentiate for the different ages at home. For Math, I found that what I needed for my homeschoolers was found in a variety of grade levels because of the nature of homeschooling. It is useful for me to have a few grade levels here to choose activities from. The plus side to that is that if you have multiple children you will continue using them as needed. I've taught for many years and homeschool my own and it is great with having a multi-age classroom. I add pages and activities in our interactive notebook as needed and exclude any I don't need.

The more you do them, the better the students and teacher get at utilizing this tool. I suggest purchasing a grade up and down.

141,Digital Educational Resources,"Spectrum | Reading Workbook | Grade 3, Printable",$8.99,3,"We purchased 9 of these Spectrum books (3 Reading, 3 Language Arts & 3 Writing, Grades 6, 3, &1) and we ended up returning all of them, except for Spectrum Reading, Grade 1. We started homeschooling on our own after the schools closed down due to COVID-19. I bought these books as a way to help the kids round out their school year since the public schools were in a scramble to adapt to online learning. While I love their set up, it required too much daily writing. We bought 9 of these books so this review is going to be copied and pasted on to each one.

If you have a reluctant writer or are planning on buying several different Spectrum workbooks for one child, then I will warn you that the workbooks require a lot of writing. A LOT of writing. If you do love the layout of these books, then I would suggest that you alternate which ones your child works on in a single day. My oldest daughter (6th grade) is not a reluctant writer and even she dreaded having to do these books. So if you want to try them out I suggest only getting one at a time and doing only a page a day. A lesson is generally 2-3 pages. If you have a reluctant writer those 2-3 pages will take over an hour to complete. If you child has no issue with writing, then they might be a good fit. Or if you are just wanting one workbook to help your child brush up on certain skills it can be a great choice.

I also noticed the the workbooks seem to stay on the same topic no matter which grade level book you are working out of. So if the 6th grade book was on a lesson about pronouns, then the same lesson number would also be about pronouns in the 3rd & 1st grade books. So this can be helpful if you have multiple children and want to keep them on the same lesson idea. Just be aware that while many line up exactly there are a few off here and there.

The only one of these workbooks we enjoyed is the Spectrum Reading, Grade 1. There is little to no writing required in the book. The first half is an ongoing story about Little Duck. So you read three story ""clips"" and then ask your child the questions written below the clips. This is normally only a few minutes long, depending on how talkative your child is when it comes to the answers. The other side of the lesson generally has 1-3 photos in 3 rows and the directions are as simple as circling what goes together, number the sequence, write the beginning sound, write the ending sound, identify the cluster, etc. Very little writing. We haven't yet gotten to the second part of the book, but it looks like it is going to be longer stories with comprehension questions. I can update my review once we hit that part.

If you need ideas for what else to look for in case you decide against these workbooks: We ended up switching out our 6th grade writing for an actual writing program (Essentials in Writing), our 3rd & 1st grade writing book was switched out for Writing with Ease (available on Amazon, highly recommend if you have reluctant writers). Our 6th grade language arts was switched out for the same program she does for writing. The language arts for 3rd &1st grade was switched out for Grammar Galaxy. Our 3rd grade reading workbook was replaced with 180 Days of Reading, 4th Grade (same comprehension workbook, but the answers are in multiple choice form instead of writing out long answers). Our 6th grade reading has been replaced for now with Evan Moor's Greek and Roman Myths Literature Pockets (also on Amazon).",fair

143,Digital Educational Resources,"Spectrum | Reading Workbook | Grade 3, Printable",$8.99,5,"I am a reading tutor and this is my favorite workbook. It is particularly good for students who have difficulty with inference and causation. Topics are a mix of fiction and related non-fiction. Along with other 3rd grade tasks, it teaches how the emotions and interactions of the characters affect their behavior. It has some direct answer questions and some that require inference. An example is a story about a boy having a bad day at soccer practice and wanting to quit. The student has to identify characteristics of the boy and the coach as well as why the boy wants to quit. It asks for the students to identify parts in the story that tell how the boy is feeling and what he is thinking. The next story is the mother asking questions to identify that the boy missed lunch and coming up with a solution of a snack before practice. The questions then relate back to the student if they ever wanted to give up. A drawback is that the Grade 3 is prominent on the cover, but pages can be pulled out for delayed readers.

But once we crossed that hurtle, they did well. They enjoy creating the interactive notebook pages, and it's great to have these to refer back to when we touch on the subjects again. I suggest writing out whatever you can have them write out BEFORE gluing the paper down, because the glue makes the paper soft and more difficult to write on.

He needed to get the feel for the weight and pressure of a pencil versus lightly dragging a marker over a slick surface and getting the same result.

210,Digital Educational Resources,"Spectrum | Language Arts Workbook | Grade 1, Printable",$8.99,3,"We purchased 9 of these Spectrum books (3 Reading, 3 Language Arts & 3 Writing, Grades 6, 3, &1) and we ended up returning all of them, except for Spectrum Reading, Grade 1. We started homeschooling on our own after the schools closed down due to COVID-19. I bought these books as a way to help the kids round out their school year since the public schools were in a scramble to adapt to online learning. While I love their set up, it required too much daily writing. We bought 9 of these books so this review is going to be copied and pasted on to each one.

If you have a reluctant writer or are planning on buying several different Spectrum workbooks for one child, then I will warn you that the workbooks require a lot of writing. A LOT of writing. If you do love the layout of these books, then I would suggest that you alternate which ones your child works on in a single day. My oldest daughter (6th grade) is not a reluctant writer and even she dreaded having to do these books. So if you want to try them out I suggest only getting one at a time and doing only a page a day. A lesson is generally 2-3 pages. If you have a reluctant writer those 2-3 pages will take over an hour to complete. If you child has no issue with writing, then they might be a good fit. Or if you are just wanting one workbook to help your child brush up on certain skills it can be a great choice.

I also noticed the the workbooks seem to stay on the same topic no matter which grade level book you are working out of. So if the 6th grade book was on a lesson about pronouns, then the same lesson number would also be about pronouns in the 3rd & 1st grade books. So this can be helpful if you have multiple children and want to keep them on the same lesson idea. Just be aware that while many line up exactly there are a few off here and there.

The only one of these workbooks we enjoyed is the Spectrum Reading, Grade 1. There is little to no writing required in the book. The first half is an ongoing story about Little Duck. So you read three story ""clips"" and then ask your child the questions written below the clips. This is normally only a few minutes long, depending on how talkative your child is when it comes to the answers. The other side of the lesson generally has 1-3 photos in 3 rows and the directions are as simple as circling what goes together, number the sequence, write the beginning sound, write the ending sound, identify the cluster, etc. Very little writing. We haven't yet gotten to the second part of the book, but it looks like it is going to be longer stories with comprehension questions. I can update my review once we hit that part.

If you need ideas for what else to look for in case you decide against these workbooks: We ended up switching out our 6th grade writing for an actual writing program (Essentials in Writing), our 3rd & 1st grade writing book was switched out for Writing with Ease (available on Amazon, highly recommend if you have reluctant writers). Our 6th grade language arts was switched out for the same program she does for writing. The language arts for 3rd &1st grade was switched out for Grammar Galaxy. Our 3rd grade reading workbook was replaced with 180 Days of Reading, 4th Grade (same comprehension workbook, but the answers are in multiple choice form instead of writing out long answers). Our 6th grade reading has been replaced for now with Evan Moor's Greek and Roman Myths Literature Pockets (also on Amazon).",fair
211,Digital Educational Resources,"Spectrum | Language Arts Workbook | Grade 1, Printable",$8.99,5,"Spectrum has a complete series for Language Arts. This has been a great fit for our homeschooling family as a complete curriculum (more on that below). However, the series would also be immensely valuable as stand-alone books in different situations. As stand alone books they would be great for the child who is struggling with only one aspect of language arts to get some extra assistance, for summer review, or to help advance a child who is bored in school with a specific aspect of language arts. While the books together make a complete curriculum, they do not reference back-and-forth within each other, so each book can easily be used on its own.

I am thoroughly impressed with this Language Arts book. It starts off right away with parts of speech (nouns, verbs, pronouns, adjectives, and prepositions). It then moves into sentences, questions, and exclamations, focusing on capitalizing the first word and putting punctuation at the end. At first this seemed very odd to me. Parts of speech seemed a lot more difficult and then we fall back to super basic things. However, why they do that soon becomes apparent as they use the parts of speech throughout the book. I also absolutely love that they use copy editing marks (i.e. the three lines under a letter to show that it needs to be capitalized). If the parts of speech words and editing marks are a part of their vocabulary and regular usage from the start, then it doesn't seem so foreign and daunting later. This book also contains sections on plurals, prefix and suffix, synonyms, antonyms, homophones, and more.
RECOMMENDATION: Schoolhouse Rock is on youtube or on DVD and makes an excellent accompaniment to the parts of speech in particular! They helped reinforce the information very well!

In order to make a complete curriculum you will want to have the following books:

- Language Arts (instruction in parts of speech, grammar, and sentence structure)
- Reading (this is not helping a child learn to read, this is reading comprehension - reading short stories or passages and then answering questions related to what the child just read)
- Phonics (learning to read)
- Spelling (weekly spelling lists with different modalities to learn grade appropriate spelling words)
- Writing (a great progression in how to write - stories, letters, directions, informative, etc.)

For homeschooling purposes this has been wonderful as a complete curriculum. Many other language arts curriculums are an all-in-one deal. 1st grade language arts means 1st grade across the board. However, if your child is a more advanced reader, that means phonics, reading, and maybe spelling will be far too easy at a 1st grade level. Having all the parts in different books allows you to move up or down in grade level(s) to tailor the language arts to fit your child best (they are not connected so that you HAVE to do all on the same level). We do 1st grade language arts and writing, 2nd grade spelling, 3rd grade reading and phonics. I could never do this with an all-in-one without spending a fortune getting all the different levels and then mixing it up. Having separate books also seems to be easier on my child because they feel like they are doing something new when we pull another book out and it gives us the flexibility to do some in the morning, some after lunch, and some on another day without feeling like there are loose ends.

OVERALL, I highly recommend the entire Spectrum language arts series of books, and this Language Arts book in particular is definitely worth the money and is very comprehensive for 1st grade.",positive

It covers a nice range of topics, and mixes multiple choice answers with answers that require a little more thought. Each lesson is broken out into a one-page article on the topic, so you can work in small sections or do more at one time if you choose. There are some things he has already learned, and some lessons that are new, so if you have a 7th-8th grader this should be a good bridge book or possibly a good refresher.

*Revised review - so we have been working through this book for a few weeks now, and I am not as pleased as I thought I would be. There is critical thinking, and then there is this book. Even after reading it myself, there are some answers I could not find. When looking at the answers provided in the back of the book, it would have taken the student 4-5 additional steps beyond what was learned in the text to get that answer, making a lot of assumptions about information that is not presented. I have purchased 2 other books for other subjects that happen to be of the ""big fat notebook"" variety that are very well written, and I wish I had purchased that one for science instead of this book.",negative

240,Digital Educational Resources,"Spectrum | Writing Workbook | Grade 3, Printable",$8.99,3,"We purchased 9 of these Spectrum books (3 Reading, 3 Language Arts & 3 Writing, Grades 6, 3, &1) and we ended up returning all of them, except for Spectrum Reading, Grade 1. We started homeschooling on our own after the schools closed down due to COVID-19. I bought these books as a way to help the kids round out their school year since the public schools were in a scramble to adapt to online learning. While I love their set up, it required too much daily writing. We bought 9 of these books so this review is going to be copied and pasted on to each one.

If you have a reluctant writer or are planning on buying several different Spectrum workbooks for one child, then I will warn you that the workbooks require a lot of writing. A LOT of writing. If you do love the layout of these books, then I would suggest that you alternate which ones your child works on in a single day. My oldest daughter (6th grade) is not a reluctant writer and even she dreaded having to do these books. So if you want to try them out I suggest only getting one at a time and doing only a page a day. A lesson is generally 2-3 pages. If you have a reluctant writer those 2-3 pages will take over an hour to complete. If you child has no issue with writing, then they might be a good fit. Or if you are just wanting one workbook to help your child brush up on certain skills it can be a great choice.

I also noticed the the workbooks seem to stay on the same topic no matter which grade level book you are working out of. So if the 6th grade book was on a lesson about pronouns, then the same lesson number would also be about pronouns in the 3rd & 1st grade books. So this can be helpful if you have multiple children and want to keep them on the same lesson idea. Just be aware that while many line up exactly there are a few off here and there.

The only one of these workbooks we enjoyed is the Spectrum Reading, Grade 1. There is little to no writing required in the book. The first half is an ongoing story about Little Duck. So you read three story ""clips"" and then ask your child the questions written below the clips. This is normally only a few minutes long, depending on how talkative your child is when it comes to the answers. The other side of the lesson generally has 1-3 photos in 3 rows and the directions are as simple as circling what goes together, number the sequence, write the beginning sound, write the ending sound, identify the cluster, etc. Very little writing. We haven't yet gotten to the second part of the book, but it looks like it is going to be longer stories with comprehension questions. I can update my review once we hit that part.

If you need ideas for what else to look for in case you decide against these workbooks: We ended up switching out our 6th grade writing for an actual writing program (Essentials in Writing), our 3rd & 1st grade writing book was switched out for Writing with Ease (available on Amazon, highly recommend if you have reluctant writers). Our 6th grade language arts was switched out for the same program she does for writing. The language arts for 3rd &1st grade was switched out for Grammar Galaxy. Our 3rd grade reading workbook was replaced with 180 Days of Reading, 4th Grade (same comprehension workbook, but the answers are in multiple choice form instead of writing out long answers). Our 6th grade reading has been replaced for now with Evan Moor's Greek and Roman Myths Literature Pockets (also on Amazon).",fair

267,Digital Educational Resources,"Spectrum | Language Arts Workbook | Grade 7, Printable",$8.99,2,"I am a language educator, and I am sorry to say that this workbook has already proven to have many improper and inaccurate grammar lessons/responses. We are only on page 25 and we've already run into 3 pages that had errors on them. Just one example is the out-of-date idea that when you refer to a child (in general), you would use ""she"" as the pronoun. In this age of gender topics, it is incredibly out-moded to refer to a child as ""she"".

For example: If a child wanted to become a writer, (she, they) should begin at an early age. The supposed ""correct"" answer, according to the book, was ""she"". Today's common use would demand that ""they"" be the appropriate response.

Another issue: The subject-verb agreement page has an incorrect response to one of its questions.

This is just scratching the surface. Parents, you do NOT want your children to learn these ""grammar rules"" and consider them as facts, especially if you hope to have them take the SAT or other college-level exam later in life. They will be ill-prepared with inaccurate information. I hope that Spectrum will re-evaluate these workbooks and correct for accuracy, because I otherwise enjoy the colorful nature of what is typically a rather dry topic (grammar).",negative

However he is going to 1st grade this fall i wanted him to have more understanding in math.

We completed half of the book by doing 2-3 pages per day. He finished first grade from this workbook last fall.

I’m thinking of buying these kind of books to challenge him more. He gets confident by doing the problems right.

The book itself well made, easy to keep up for the kids and not much pictures to distract them.
But i wish it had more word problem solving in the book.

I’ll definitely buy next grade after we complete it.",positive

In this workbook, there are a few references to ""millions of years"" and evolution, but those are only in maybe a handful of the readings. I went through and noted those readings that I had concerns with, so he and I discuss them first when he gets to them. There are only a couple of them that I marked as not wanting him to do at all because of the way the information is presented, though we still had a brief discussion about it. The rest is good science material. (It is a good thing for you to have this conversation with your child, rather than to avoid showing them opposing information at all. At some point in their life they are going to have to be able to discuss these issues intelligently with those who hold opposing views.

391,Digital Educational Resources,"Spectrum | Writing Workbook | Grade 1, Printable",$8.99,3,"We purchased 9 of these Spectrum books (3 Reading, 3 Language Arts & 3 Writing, Grades 6, 3, &1) and we ended up returning all of them, except for Spectrum Reading, Grade 1. We starting homeschooling on our own after the schools closed down due to COVID-19. I bought these books as a way to help the kids round out their school year since the public schools were in a scramble to adapt to online learning. While I love their set up, it required too much daily writing. We bought 9 of these books so this review is going to be copied and pasted on to each one.

If you have a reluctant writer or are planning on buying several different Spectrum workbooks for one child, then I will warn you that the workbooks require a lot of writing. A LOT of writing. If you do love the layout of these books, then I would suggest that you alternate which ones your child works on in a single day. My oldest daughter (6th grade) is not a reluctant writer and even she dreaded having to do these books. So if you want to try them out I suggest only getting one at a time and doing only a page a day. A lesson is generally 2-3 pages. If you have a reluctant writer those 2-3 pages will take over an hour to complete. If you child has no issue with writing, then they might be a good fit. Or if you are just wanting one workbook to help your child brush up on certain skills it can be a great choice.

I also noticed the the workbooks seem to stay on the same topic no matter which grade level book you are working out of. So if the 6th grade book was on a lesson about pronouns, then the same lesson number would also be about pronouns in the 3rd & 1st grade books. So this can be helpful if you have multiple children and want to keep them on the same lesson idea. Just be aware that while many line up exactly there are a few off here and there.

The only one of these workbooks we enjoyed is the Spectrum Reading, Grade 1. There is little to no writing required in the book. The first half is an ongoing story about Little Duck. So you read three story ""clips"" and then ask your child the questions written below the clips. This is normally only a few minutes long, depending on how talkative your child is when it comes to the answers. The other side of the lesson generally has 1-3 photos in 3 rows and the directions are as simple as circling what goes together, number the sequence, write the beginning sound, write the ending sound, identify the cluster, etc. Very little writing. We haven't yet gotten to the second part of the book, but it looks like it is going to be longer stories with comprehension questions. I can update my review once we hit that part.

If you need ideas for what else to look for in case you decide against these workbooks: We ended up switching out our 6th grade writing for an actual writing program (Essentials in Writing), our 3rd & 1st grade writing book was switched out for Writing with Ease (available on Amazon, highly recommend if you have reluctant writers). Our 6th grade language arts was switched out for the same program she does for writing. The language arts for 3rd &1st grade was switched out for Grammar Galaxy. Our 3rd grade reading workbook was replaced with 180 Days of Reading, 4th Grade (same comprehension workbook, but the answers are in multiple choice form instead of writing out long answers). Our 6th grade reading has been replaced for now with Evan Moor's Greek and Roman Myths Literature Pockets (also on Amazon).",fair
392,Digital Educational Resources,"Spectrum | Writing Workbook | Grade 1, Printable",$8.99,5,"Spectrum has a complete series for Language Arts. This has been a great fit for our homeschooling family as a complete curriculum (more on that below). However, the series would also be immensely valuable as stand-alone books in different situations. As stand alone books they would be great for the child who is struggling with only one aspect of language arts to get some extra assistance, for summer review, or to help advance a child who is bored in school with a specific aspect of language arts. While the books together make a complete curriculum, they do not reference back-and-forth within each other, so each book can easily be used on its own.

This Writing book starts off with a section on writing basics which includes naming things (""I see a __________""), feelings, describing, sentences and questions. It then has three sections on writing - Writing a Story, Writing to Inform, and Writing an Opinion. There is a post-test at the end of each of the four sections which is a nice review of what was learned. This book is very thorough in covering many different types of writing and establishing a good foundation for future writing skills. There is a sufficient amount of space to write in the book. It is a good balance of teaching, and doing. There are a total of 32 lessons. Given the fact that there are usually about 36 weeks in a school year, this is a perfect fit and allows a few extra weeks in case someone is sick, you go on vacation, you want to spend extra time on a lesson, or just to have some fun creative writing at the end. Don't let looks fool you - it looks small, but there is a lot in there!

In order to make a complete curriculum you will want to have the following books:

- Language Arts (instruction in parts of speech, grammar, and sentence structure)
- Reading (this is not helping a child learn to read, this is reading comprehension - reading short stories or passages and then answering questions related to what the child just read)
- Phonics (learning to read)
- Spelling (weekly spelling lists with different modalities to learn grade appropriate spelling words)
- Writing (a great progression in how to write - stories, letters, directions, informative, etc.)

For homeschooling purposes this has been wonderful as a complete curriculum. Many other language arts curriculums are an all-in-one deal. 1st grade language arts means 1st grade across the board. However, if your child is a more advanced reader, that means phonics, reading, and maybe spelling will be far too easy at a 1st grade level. Having all the parts in different books allows you to move up or down in grade level(s) to tailor the language arts to fit your child best (they are not connected so that you HAVE to do all on the same level). We do 1st grade language arts and writing, 2nd grade spelling, 3rd grade reading and phonics. I could never do this with an all-in-one without spending a fortune getting all the different levels and then mixing it up. Having separate books also seems to be easier on my child because they feel like they are doing something new when we pull another book out and it gives us the flexibility to do some in the morning, some after lunch, and some on another day without feeling like there are loose ends.

OVERALL, I highly recommend the entire Spectrum language arts series of books, and this Writing book in particular is definitely worth the money and is very comprehensive for 1st grade.",positive

The level of skill goes up pretty quickly. A few pages of one word answers, then sentences, then paragraphs, then full pages of writing.
The children I work with can use more practice with each stage-which I’m supplementing with other sources.
Perhaps a smaller book for each stage of writing?",positive

401,Digital Educational Resources,"Spectrum | Writing Workbook | Grade 1, Printable",$23.99,3,"We purchased 9 of these Spectrum books (3 Reading, 3 Language Arts & 3 Writing, Grades 6, 3, &1) and we ended up returning all of them, except for Spectrum Reading, Grade 1. We starting homeschooling on our own after the schools closed down due to COVID-19. I bought these books as a way to help the kids round out their school year since the public schools were in a scramble to adapt to online learning. While I love their set up, it required too much daily writing. We bought 9 of these books so this review is going to be copied and pasted on to each one.

If you have a reluctant writer or are planning on buying several different Spectrum workbooks for one child, then I will warn you that the workbooks require a lot of writing. A LOT of writing. If you do love the layout of these books, then I would suggest that you alternate which ones your child works on in a single day. My oldest daughter (6th grade) is not a reluctant writer and even she dreaded having to do these books. So if you want to try them out I suggest only getting one at a time and doing only a page a day. A lesson is generally 2-3 pages. If you have a reluctant writer those 2-3 pages will take over an hour to complete. If you child has no issue with writing, then they might be a good fit. Or if you are just wanting one workbook to help your child brush up on certain skills it can be a great choice.

I also noticed the the workbooks seem to stay on the same topic no matter which grade level book you are working out of. So if the 6th grade book was on a lesson about pronouns, then the same lesson number would also be about pronouns in the 3rd & 1st grade books. So this can be helpful if you have multiple children and want to keep them on the same lesson idea. Just be aware that while many line up exactly there are a few off here and there.

The only one of these workbooks we enjoyed is the Spectrum Reading, Grade 1. There is little to no writing required in the book. The first half is an ongoing story about Little Duck. So you read three story ""clips"" and then ask your child the questions written below the clips. This is normally only a few minutes long, depending on how talkative your child is when it comes to the answers. The other side of the lesson generally has 1-3 photos in 3 rows and the directions are as simple as circling what goes together, number the sequence, write the beginning sound, write the ending sound, identify the cluster, etc. Very little writing. We haven't yet gotten to the second part of the book, but it looks like it is going to be longer stories with comprehension questions. I can update my review once we hit that part.

If you need ideas for what else to look for in case you decide against these workbooks: We ended up switching out our 6th grade writing for an actual writing program (Essentials in Writing), our 3rd & 1st grade writing book was switched out for Writing with Ease (available on Amazon, highly recommend if you have reluctant writers). Our 6th grade language arts was switched out for the same program she does for writing. The language arts for 3rd &1st grade was switched out for Grammar Galaxy. Our 3rd grade reading workbook was replaced with 180 Days of Reading, 4th Grade (same comprehension workbook, but the answers are in multiple choice form instead of writing out long answers). Our 6th grade reading has been replaced for now with Evan Moor's Greek and Roman Myths Literature Pockets (also on Amazon).",fair
402,Digital Educational Resources,"Spectrum | Writing Workbook | Grade 1, Printable",$23.99,5,"Spectrum has a complete series for Language Arts. This has been a great fit for our homeschooling family as a complete curriculum (more on that below). However, the series would also be immensely valuable as stand-alone books in different situations. As stand alone books they would be great for the child who is struggling with only one aspect of language arts to get some extra assistance, for summer review, or to help advance a child who is bored in school with a specific aspect of language arts. While the books together make a complete curriculum, they do not reference back-and-forth within each other, so each book can easily be used on its own.

This Writing book starts off with a section on writing basics which includes naming things (""I see a __________""), feelings, describing, sentences and questions. It then has three sections on writing - Writing a Story, Writing to Inform, and Writing an Opinion. There is a post-test at the end of each of the four sections which is a nice review of what was learned. This book is very thorough in covering many different types of writing and establishing a good foundation for future writing skills. There is a sufficient amount of space to write in the book. It is a good balance of teaching, and doing. There are a total of 32 lessons. Given the fact that there are usually about 36 weeks in a school year, this is a perfect fit and allows a few extra weeks in case someone is sick, you go on vacation, you want to spend extra time on a lesson, or just to have some fun creative writing at the end. Don't let looks fool you - it looks small, but there is a lot in there!

In order to make a complete curriculum you will want to have the following books:

- Language Arts (instruction in parts of speech, grammar, and sentence structure)
- Reading (this is not helping a child learn to read, this is reading comprehension - reading short stories or passages and then answering questions related to what the child just read)
- Phonics (learning to read)
- Spelling (weekly spelling lists with different modalities to learn grade appropriate spelling words)
- Writing (a great progression in how to write - stories, letters, directions, informative, etc.)

For homeschooling purposes this has been wonderful as a complete curriculum. Many other language arts curriculums are an all-in-one deal. 1st grade language arts means 1st grade across the board.
