So after dealing with my heart break I finally have decided to come and let you all know that the beloved Ice did melt after almost 4days. It will be greatly missed. But I must also add that during this time (just over a week) of owning this flask it has been drop out of my semi truck on multiple occasions (not intentionally) yet this suckered still doesn't leak. Surprisingly even the lid has held up which I us the spout one with the straw and clip handle. How this thing hasnt broke from a repead 5ft+ drop is just amazing. I have managed to dent the bottom rim but even that is barely dented. This suckered is insane. It has become my new go to. I went from drinking 3-4 large sodas a day to now only drinking maybe half a large soda in the entire time I've had the flask. This thing has been a life saver.

Original review: So I had been hesitant to order a bottle for my truckfor a while as I was worried it wouldn't stay cols and stopping for ice regularly isn't ideal. But holy freaking cow this suckered keeps ice for days. I filled it with ice then added water, in 24hrs it barely melted 1/4 of the ice. Going to see how many days it takes to melt it all. With full ice in it it can hold just under a qt of water (64oz flask). It is fridged cold. Spout works great with the straw so I don't have to tilt it to drink while driving and the little handle is perfect to grab with out needing to take my eyes off the road. I am in love with this and it is drastically helping me to drink more water and avoid soda. I ordered the carry bag today so I can hang it from my arm rest for easier access when driving and u have a feeling that will make the ice last even longer. Definitely one of the best investments if you are trying to drink more water. I also love that the handle has a clip on it which is awesome if you want to hang the flash off something. Downside is it won't fit into my truck cup holder which is surprising since they are much bigger then cars but this flask is so well built that it hasn't tiped over yet. Oh and the leak proof thing works really well too. Definitely recommend this to anyone that likes super cold drinks and doesnt want the ice to melt easily. I would guess it keeps stuff hotdogs a long time too but ionly intend to use it for water.",positive

After searching for the ultimate cold water container that could keep the water cold for a long time, could survive my husband and me, and have a solid spout/straw and hold more than a few ounces.
12/2019:
We bought :64 oz (2), 22 oz (2) for the cup holder dilemma. Constantly used and often encountering life events. Outdoor enthusiasts don't have a monopoly on stress testing, try being clumsy and inattentive. Yes, dear readers, these have survived an entire family with serious ADHD and one person who is a Sagittarius with 50+ years experience. We've been the undoing of many ""indestructible "" products, and a lot of destructible ones as well.
12/2020:
Since the previous products survived and didn't require any creative repairs that are common and a part of life, then the purchase of: 16 oz and 14oz tumblers for coffee and espresso respectively.
Interesting discovery: 16 oz coffee or espresso is emptied in about 10 minutes without realization, only issue is that you have to remove the lid to get the last sip or expect it to spill the rest onto any available important item within a 2 ft /.85(?)m. An education on awareness and the ballistic and physics of the contents is a free bonus with the tumblers . The manufacturer's engineers did a commendable job designing a cup that lets you see the quantity left without removing the lid, a pressure opening that doesn't get blocked by your nose while inhaling your beverage or well-mannered sipping.
That brings up the characteristic that you can feel the temperature of the contents before bolting down coffee-flavored molten rock threatening the future of your tongue. You can avoid the dreaded fresh pizza effect.
Additionally, the thermal maintenance is not at the same level as a sealed thermal container, but it does buy you more time to get a sip while the temperature is good...
We have used the 64 oz daily, bring them with us everywhere and thoroughly sanitized them since 2019. Only issue we've faced that I can't fix is the spring on the handle on both of our lids. This has, in no way affected the function of the container . The product line is still a 5 star purchase, in my opinion.
P.S.- The claim about the ice lasting until the next day was proven true.",positive

I definitely got it in this bottle. I love this thing, and got a parachord handle to go with it, so when I go for walks or go to outdoor events it's perfect to take with me. I've dropped it more than a few times and while the paint will chip, it still holds up. What's a stainless steel water bottle without a few dings, anyway? It gives it character.

However, I've learned that 32 oz is a little too beefy for me. First, it's a metal water bottle that holds water. It's going to be heavy, and heavy when you bring it up to your mouth to drink. But BE WARNED: don't drop this on your feet. It's going to hurt and you're liable to break something. Second, with how big it is, it doesn't fit in my cup holder in my car, and struggles to fit in any backpack bottle holder. Third, it will leak. Even before I dropped it it leaked if it was laying sideways, so when I use it and take it in my car, I'm careful to never let it lay sideways.

All that being said, it's sturdy and keeps my water cold. I'd never heard of Iron Flask as a brand before this bottle but it's made me a loyal customer. And with it being easy to clean, it's fantastic. The bottle itself feels smooth but is easy to grip (I have small hands, but it's not slipping around in my hand). I have a Camelback bottle that has a similar paint, but it's more coarse and with my touch-sensitivity issues, I've had to get used to that. It made me appreciate my Iron Flask all the more because there was never that issue.

I'm going to purchase a 24 oz Iron Flask so I can carry it in my cupholders in my car. I'm not one to follow brands, and the ""hype"" Hydroflask puts me off simply because it's so ""everywhere"". I'll stick to my Iron Flasks, thank you very much. Thank you for making a reliable product! Just please fix the leak issue.",positive

When I first opened it I washed it by hand like it said that filled it with ice and water, I only took a few drinks and forgot about it and left the house for about 4 or 5 hours and when I got back the ice wasn’t melted yet. It really surprised me but after that I had to leave the house again for another 3 hours and once I got back sure the ice was gone but it was still super cold. The only thing I can complain about is that you have to hand wash it but honestly that’s just me being lazy. I really like this water bottle for the price it’s definitely worth it. I bought the 18 oz because I wanted it to be small enough to fit in my cup holder and not get in the way of anything. I would 10/10 recommend this water bottle to anyone in the market for one.",positive

The coloring options were amazing, so many to choose from. My kiddo picked the white to black ombré. I purchased the 32oz, as it gets HOT here in the summer. I put ice in a quarter way up, and the. water in the rest of the bottle, and when my kid gets home, the ice is still in there. He said his water says cold all day, even when outside playing in the heat, and that has helped him stay more hydrated because cold water tastes best. 😅

He finds it easy to drink from. It came with 3 lid options, and he likes the straw because it’s the quickest way to drink. It doesn’t leak when the straw is closed, and it’s stays closed unlike others he’s had. It’s super easy to clean, but you’ll want a a bottle brush. Overall, great product for less money compared to other name brands.",positive

I mean that my bottle never leaves my side. I have a bottle with me morning, noon and night. I refill it at least 10 times a day. I have it on my bedside table. I am thirsty. All the time. I have been using Contigo bottles for many years for this purpose, and while Contigo wins in a few ways, Iron Flask wins in others. I wanted to start using stainless steel, double walled bottles after just getting fed up with the nonstop condensation, and while I'll drink water basically any temperature, there is nothing like ice cold water. Hold on while I take a chug right now...................

I've used this bottle (plus it's sibling that I ordered 2 days later because I was instantly obsessed) for 2 months. I really wanted to get my time in to have a good idea of what to write, to know a little about the longevity of it.

The packaging was neat, the boxes match the bottle color scheme. Open the box and it had the 3 tops, 2 straws and the bottle. At the bottom, a card reminder to sign up for the warranty and a sticker! The bottle has a nice paint job, not a flaw on either of them. The color has held up this far, and while I don't try to throw this bottle as hard as possible on rocks and concrete for fun, I have knocked it over, smacked it into things and still have no scuffs or dents. Invest in an Iron Flask rubbery bottom thing. It is a useful tool.

I have zero leaks. This bottle gets rolled around a lot because it gets knocked over. No leaks. I have tried to get it to leak. No leaks.

My ice stays ICY. For a long time. Fill it up at night, chug it through the night, refill it in the morning with the same ice. Drink that. Still have ice, maybe top if off with more ice. But I have never had room temperature water in this bottle.

Cleaning this bottle takes no effort, if you don't already have bottle brushes, get some but washing this bottle takes zero time at all.

Stainless steel is superior to my plastic Contigo bottles. In every way. The only thing I miss from my Contigos is the mouthpiece for the straw; they are rubbery and don't smack my teeth, as I have done with the Iron Flask because I was so used to the other, and the Contigo folds in and it closes a little door thing over the mouthpiece, whereas the Iron Flask is just out in the open. Also, Contigo bottles are plain and boring so I could put stickers on it, these bottles are too pretty. Now I have to wait however long for the paint to start chipping and getting ugly to use stickers.",positive

It is by far my favorite water bottle. It comes with three different lids to choose from. I use the one with the straw. The pull up spout fits snugly into the stored position and will not accidentally open and spill the contents. It is great at keeping the ice from melting, even through the night. It has a great clip feature on the handle that is very convenient. I also bought the paracord handle and the silicone boot for the bottle. The paracord handle gives you another option for carrying and the silicone boot is a dent saver. I dropped the bottle a couple of time on concrete sidewalks and it came away without a scratch or dent. On top of all of its features it costs less the the more well known brand. My wife liked mine so much I purchased one for her. They worked great on our recent vacation.",positive

I would expect that from the twice as expensive Yeti brand, but surprised at this lower price point.

It comes with three drinking options,(I chose the flio-straw), and that works well for me.

This is my third bottle order from them not counting the paracord straps and rubber bottom grips. It arrived very quickly. The lid came to me broken and I reached out to their customer service. In the past they were great so I was hesitant my good luck would run out. I was so wrong. They were extremely helpful, apologetic and sent me a replacement with an extra lid on top of it and was sent to me 2 days after I spoke to them. The turnaround time was 8 days from ordering the bottle, to the replacement arriving. I will forever talk them up just because of the customer service alone!

I added a paracord strap on it for easy carrying. The color is so pretty(bubble gum) I like the size so I can put allot of ice in and water stays cold. I also just plan on using it for ice when traveling. I believe I will get a 22 oz as a companion probably in the color aurora. I also like the fact they give 3 lids accept for the cap with the plastic straw, it makes the water tastes like plastic. I removed the straw.

Unfortunately he will not approach her when I am around, so I made the investment. To help her gain some confidence in her device, I let her test it on me...
Do not do as I did.

To give you some background, I am a career military soldier, with 4 deployments to Iraq. After my last tour I took a job as a bodyguard. I am also a patron of concerts and clubs. Suffice it to say I've been exposed to some of the best crowd control in the business.
You have about 5 to 10 seconds of coherance (barely) after contact, and after that, your only concern is pain. Even with my prior experiance, I was completely incapacitated. If I were an earnest attacker, this would deter my attack immediately. My wife is not a trained combatant, and she hit me with a glancing spray across my cheek and that was enough to stop me. (Ideally one would draw a line from ear to ear for max. effect)
There is no quick cure for the pain, as is the case with most OC sprays. Even with the coolit spray which is intended to reduce the effects, you are still out of action for at least 30 minutes.

Some tips when using this product.
-TEST YOUR PRODUCT WHEN YOU OPEN IT!!! There is a 1 in 5000 chance that your device may be defective. Go outside and spray a few lines downwind just to be sure it will not fail you in that critical moment.
-AFTER YOU SPRAY someone, LEAVE THE AREA IMMEDIATELY. If you stay, your assailant may go into a rage which not even OC spray can stop. If you decide to take the fight to the attacker, then you risk losing your right to self defense and crossing over to getting an assault charge. Just go. When you are safely gone, call the police and inform them of the situation. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
-AFTERCARE IS CRITICAL. After you spray someone, you must call an ambulance. If your attacker or anyone who may have been caught up in the spray as well is asthmatic or has allergies you could wind up killing them. That is grounds for a manslaughter charge at least.
-IF YOU SPRAY YOURSELF, that really sucks. There is no quick fix. Find a safe location and wait it out. Use soap and water to rinse yourself repeatedly and allow air to get to the affected area. Expect to be out of action for an hour. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU ALLOW THIS STUFF TO COME IN CONTACT WITH YOUR HANDS. Your hands are the primary means for spreading contamination, and if you spray your pocket, and then scratch your head, you will know. Also, go ahead and trash those clothes you were wearing, this stuff can contaminate an entire load of laundry.

Hopefully you will never have to use this stuff on anybody. It is truely hell. The best defense is paying attention to what you are doing, the way you are presenting yourself, and avoiding uneasy situations.

I was feeling very threatened and so kept my hand on the trigger as he threatened and shouted, and when he attacked me all it took was two quick sprays and he was completely incapacitated. He couldn't inflict any damage on me even though he is a bodybuilder and MUCH bigger than me. The only problem is that when I sprayed it he was tackling me and so some of the spray hit me. I was probably hit with only 10% of the spray but I can tell you it was TERRIBLE. It was so powerful that the cops couldn't stay in the house for long because of the residual in the air. So maybe next time I'll practice shooting it more. In sum, the Sabre spray saved me from definite injury and I cannot be more satisfied with this product.

Unfortunately he got through. I tried to mace him but it didn't work at first & he ended up stabbing me in the side with a kitchen knife. As I fought with him, my other house mate picked up the mace & successfuly maced him. Though it did affect both of us.

My crazy house mate let go of the knife as he covered his eyes in pain. He then ran out the room to the bathroom to wash off the mace.

That seems oretty obvious in hindsight but honestly I was so excited to test it out my logic went out the window.
The quick pull keychain makes this thing perfect for any sudden need for the pepper spray and the slide cover conceals the spray well. My only complaint is the safety system moves a bit too easily so just be aware of that so you dont accidentally spray your bag while your keys are inside.
Other than that its perfect size, perfect amount of ozs, legal amount of chemical ratio to take to the airport or carry around for self defense.

I lived in a very crowded urban area and there were enough times in my life where I wish I had it, and didn't. A couple years ago, I picked some up at a local store. Since then, I've had to use it. Twice.

I gave this product a four because there is no substitute for being aware of your surroundings and having knowledge of how to respond or react to any situation that may come your way. There is no end all be all product when trying to ensure your safety. But this certainly helps.

I was pickpocketed for my cell phone, and before I could turn to confront the man, I had already been struck in the face and pummelled to the ground. I let off a four second burst directly into his eye nose and face area from my position on the ground, around his back and over his shoulder. He made it four blocks away before he began to feel effects and I was able to catch up to him and retrieve my cell phone. I had the spray concealed in my hand prior to the incident, because I always kept it ready while walking at night ""just in case.""

I have heard many mentions of the Sabre line of products. So after doing some research I decided to give this brand a shot next. Having said that and giving mention of my own personal experience carrying and wielding pepper spray, I will now come to a few points I would like to make on my observations of this product.

The clip requires two bands to operate. The clip is great for car keys and such, but not for me. I don't drive and I prefer to wear mine on my hip. In the situation I was in, if my spray wasn't in my hand, I would not have had two hands available to work the clip properly to access my spray. I tested the clip a few times. It won't break. Very solid actually. So, I don't use it. I use a chain that allows my spray to hang visibly from my hip on my dominant side that if I were to yank firmly at the cannister, the can would break free and be in my hand ready to use. This operation can be applied with one hand in a critical situation.

The aforementioned spray took effect eventually, but still allowed to the assailant to run four blocks first. In that situation I had sprayed myself quite a bit as well, due to the angle/position I found myself in. When I primed the Sabre spray I purposely exposed myself to it about the same amount as before, and I must say this mix is definitely stronger and more potent. I don't ever expect pepper spray to put down an attacker, however this stuff I am confident will certainly stun someone, giving you some extra seconds to remove yourself from the situation. This recipe is of a much better quality than whatever generic brand I had used last time. The assailant on the receiving end of this spray is definitely going to feel it.

The hard case's grip took me a little getting used to after using a naked cannister for so long, but it didn't take long. A little practice and I became familiar with it. It is actually very comfortable and smooth. The lock isn't as tight as I'd like it to be, but as I don't usually carry this in my pocket that wasn't too important a feature to me. I'm fairly certain it wouldn't accidentally discharge in a purse or jacket pocket, though. Speaking on the case, it definitely LOOKS like pepper spray. When wearing it in a visible place, like clipped to your belt or on a purse or backpack, it can be a added deterrent for someone looking for a potential victim. Just the presence of the can may make someone decide bothering you may not be worth the effort involved.

The spray shoots a solid ten feet in a solid stream. It is red in color, but this model does not have UV dye. I prefer no UV dye. That's my personal preference and I have my reasons for it. I'm happy Sabre makes a product that is straight pepper spray such as this one. Stronger formula than other sprays I've encountered, therefore I trust it a little bit more to do a little better job.

Last, I'll speak on the price. I have purchased two of these, one for myself, and one for my wife. She likes the pink one, which I agree with because it is more visible, anyway. I live in the woods now, and bears/dogs etc. have become the new threat. I don't know how effective this would be on a bear. I honestly think it would just p*** him off. But my wife and her family insist it is better to have it if you really were being attacked by a bear, and they have lived up here a lot longer than I have, so I trust their opinions. But I digress. For twenty dollars, my wife and I both now have a can, and knowing that her and I have one within reach gives me a peace of mind that is worth so much more to me than twenty dollars.

I hope I never have to use it, but if I do, I'll be sure to update this review and fill you in on my experience!

Ten dollars or less to stay safe is a good investment. I hope this review has been helpful to someone thinking about purchasing this product. Thanks!

*Update!* This is a self-propelled formula. Shaking of the can etc., may be contributing to the various problems previous customers have had with leaking cannisters! I don't shake my can around, and have carried it topside down on my hip for a while now with no leaking problems at all.",positive

30,Sports & Outdoors,"EnerPlex Air Mattress with Built-in Pump - Double Height Inflatable Mattress for Camping, Home & Portable Travel - Durable Blow Up Bed with Dual Pump - Easy to Inflate/Quick Set UP",$42.10 - $149.99,5,"I purchased this air mattress/bed after reading all of the positive reviews and I'm glad that I did. All the positive points were accurate; inflated quickly, good quality,etc. And, despite the few negative reviews about it not holding air, I can only say that those people must have gotten a defective product because not only did mine hold air for at least a couple of months, I even had to let a little air out at one point.

Now...as for the warranty. The 2 year warranty is the primary reason that I'm writing this review so that potential purchasers will know that they are not lying.

After close to 3 months, though it had held air that entire time, all of a sudden it began losing air to the point that it became completely deflated within a few hours. Try as I might, I could not find a leak, so...I called them on the phone to let them know.

Not only were they gracious, they kept their word about the 2 year warranty and sent me a new mattress!

Over the years I've noticed that people will clamor to write a bad review if they are unhappy with a product or service, but if they're happy with the product they won't take the time to write about their positive experience. I'm of the philosophy that if something is good, it's only right and proper to acknowledge that, so I am.

Now...allow me to make a suggestion to the company/manufacturers...you need to make a version of this mattress WITH AN INFLATABLE HEADBOARD like some of the other air mattress companies do. Your product not having one is one of only 2 criticisms that I have about your product.

The first is that though you do indeed have the fastest built in pump to inflate the mattress, it's also the loudest. Where I live there are other people who have to get up very early to go to work and when my mattress started losing air in the middle of the night I was to afraid to inflate it as I was concerned that the loudness would wake everyone up.

My second criticism is the headboard issue. As much as I love your air mattress, I will never buy it again unless you add the inflatable headboard option to some of them.

Every night I had to pick my pillows up off the floor because they would fall off the edge despite the fact that I had the head of the bed against the wall.

I'm now using an air mattress that does have an inflatable head board as part of the bed and the difference is like night and day. I sleep more soundly and am a lot more comfortable because I'm not waking up a number of times each night to retrieve my pillows.

I buy air mattresses on a continual basis and if you guys would make one with the head board option I would buy it repeatedly for the rest of my life.

Thank you.",positive

When you first inflate it, the material will flex but it is not leaking. Give it an hour or two then inflate it a bit more and it's good to go for DAYS.

No scratches this time. Please note the width length of the air mattress warps over time. Standard queen is 60x80. After using this mattress for a month, it has morphed into 66x86 in the center, but 60x80 if you measure corner to corner. Which means there is a curve. I have a mattress topper (which didnot change dimensions and it is quite obvious that the sides of the air mattress are wider underneath the mattress topper. I did also measure with a tape to confirm, because I was sewing a cover for the air mattress)

This looks like a nice inflatable bed. Just the height I needed for guest room, but when I opened the box, I noticed there were already scratches and the felt portion was damaged/ripped (keep in mind the blue portion was folded on the inner most layer and onlying the white side was facing outward when I was unwrapping, so I know the damage must have occurred before it was packaged.)

Slightly disappointed to receive a potentially used or defective product. I am requesting replacement (shipping the damaged version back) and hoping the new one is not damaged.

I tried inflating it, just to make sure it was the size I needed. Not sure how waterproof/resistant it actually would be but the non-felt material (on the sides and bottom) seems like it should be water repellent. The cord was easy to store, but a little short so you may need extension cord. It had two valves, one for inflating and one for deflating. Overall, easy to use.

For me, its when a product goes above and beyond. You think, what could a stinkin' water bottle do that is ""above and beyond""? Well, I'm happy to say that this product is made in the USA, the water bottles are elegantly designed and have care and thought put into them: you can't imagine how difficult it is to pick out a large waterbottle that actually fits in a standard cupholder! It comes with two caps, to fit your usage. Their customer service is ultra fast, friendly, and helpful. The price is right, and above all else, can you believe the product actually works as advertised? Super cold or warm drinks for the whole day. To me, all that combined makes this a stellar product and one that I'm happy to use, and recommend wholeheartedly!

When I first got the product I assumed it was just like any other waterbottle/cheap thing you buy on Amazon, it comes from some other country, and has no instructions and a bunch of cheap accessories they throw on to inflate the price and make it seem like a better value. I've been taught this from too many Amazon products. So, I was not surprised when I unboxed it filled it up and the next morning went to drink and ended up with water pouring out down my chin.

Over the next few days I started drinking a LOT more water, because the bottle was attractive, it fit in my cupholders at work and in my car, it was convenient, and it kept the beverage enjoyable because it was ice cold- just the way I like it.

But it leaked, every time I took a sip... Disappointed, I contacted customer service to initiate a return. I was really kind of sad. The customer service person was overtly polite and apologetic and wanted to ship out a return at no cost. They even wanted me, again, fully prepaid, to return the bottle to them so they could inspect it for manufacturing defects, which I was more than happy to do. What company does that? Not many that I've dealt with. Most just want the product back so they know you aren't scamming them. However, after I started talking about a return, I did some Youtube investigating because I wanted to see if perhaps the leak was specific to the 24oz bottle or something. As I went through reviews, nobody mentioned it. And finally I stumbled upon an unboxing video where they showed someone putting the water bottle together and that's where it hit me. There is 2 straw accessories included with the water bottle. These accessories I assumed had to do with the other bottle cap that came with the product. Or, I assumed it was for if you literally just didn't want to put a cap on at all so you could drink out of the bottle. I don't know what I was thinking. I clearly wasn't. But anyway, after looking at the video I realized that it was leaking, because the straw cap is meant to be used in conjunction with one of these straws on the inside of the bottle. That way, you aren't inverting the entire water bottle upside to drink out of an open hole. What an idiot!

After I realized this, I tested it, and of course it worked. I went back to customer service and immediately told them my error. I'd like to call out Jordan who was the representative who was very helpful the whole way and may have chuckled to himself but never made me feel like an idiot.

As I mentioned, the bottle looks great, and has made me drink more water each day. I think from a combination of it being nice and cold, and from the flashy bottle being in my peripheral vision to remind me to drink. In fact, each day, even though I know you should be drinking more than one 24oz bottle a day, I have to make baby steps. And each day I come home with a bottle that was full in the morning that has less and less each progressive day. I call that a win, and it is all due to this product.

I would completely recommend this product to anyone. And plan to pick up some more bottle soon as gifts. My only negative would be that it should come with some basic instructions on how to care for it, and maybe a little idiot-proof diagram that shows if you use the straw cap, that there is an interior straw that needs to be added.",positive

My family and I live part of the year now in the desert of Nevada and I'll be honest, I was not fully prepared for the heat. My kids weren't drinking enough water and I was sick of seeing plastic water bottles half empty and everywhere. I was also not happy about the fact that I was buying plastic reusable bottles like every month or so. I started noticing that a lot of people around me were using these thermos like water bottles so I looked into them. There's a well know company that is known for these great bottles but honestly $40+ per bottle for a family of five sent me into a small panic. Underneath that well known brand was this brand. The colors were cool, they were half the price, and came with two different lids. They looked identical so I took a chance.

We have had these bottles for exactly 33 days now and this is what I'm doing cartwheels over.

- My kids, without me reminding them constantly, make sure to have it with them wherever we go.
- All five of us drink way more water now.
- I have yet to deal with any type of leak. Not one.
- Everyone is happy with their chosen color and they fit (24 oz size) in car booster seat holders and the cars cup holders.

Obviously, drinking nice ice cold water is way more refreshing than drinking hot water and bottled water here gets HOT quickly. We put ice in our bottles and, no joke, there's still ice when we wake up the next day! Maybe I've been living under a rock just now finding this exists and I don't have to carry a huge thermos around, but I'm sure someone reading this is under that same rock, too. Hopefully you love these bottles as much as we do.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.",positive
62,Sports & Outdoors,HYDRO CELL Stainless Steel Water Bottle w/ Straw & Wide Mouth Lids (64oz 40oz 32oz 24oz 18oz 14oz) - Keeps Liquids Perfectly Hot or Cold with Double Wall Vacuum Insulated Sweat Proof Sport Design,$12.74 - $25.19,5,"I own several of these in the 64oz and 40oz sizes, as well as a few from other brands for comparison. These are definitely legit and keep drinks super cold (I do not normally use them for hot drinks, but I'm sure they would work for that too). Despite being priced much less than brands like Hydro Flask they are definitely of comparable build quality and performance.

However the one problem I noticed is that the metallic cap covers are conductors of heat, and will get cold if you put any liquid from inside against them. This means the cap is allowing heat to leak in from the outside much faster than the rest of the bottle, which is not ideal. If you want the best performance personally I would suggest replacing the stock caps with a Hydro Flask wide mouth flex cap, which actually fits these bottles well and does not get cold upon contact with fluid inside the bottle.

PS: If you like to load these bottles with ice like I do, consider getting the Hydro Flask flex sip wide mouth lid. It works wonders and does not allow any ice to pour through (you do not have to take the cap off to drink), all while keeping the inside super cold (again, better than the stock lids these come with).",positive

It did not break. Did not leak.
I've had two other types of water bottles, one with a plastic lid. Yeah, that didn't last long with me. But my big issue with those other bottles was finding replacement lids. Nada. Hydro Cell has replacement lids. I bought an extra. Plus the lids fit both my 32 oz and 14 oz bottles. The mouth opening is a little larger than my past bottles, but that fraction of an inch is just enough so that when I add ice directly from my refrigerator ice dispenser, I don't have to chase the cubes around the kitchen. Just big enough to capture the ice. The bottle also fits nicely in both the drink holders in the consoles in my cars. I carry the 14 oz bottle in the web holder in my fanny pack on walks. The 32 oz fits nicely on my recumbent elliptical or treadmill for exercising. Living in the desert, one of these is always with me. I use Reverse Osmosis purified water, so I don't clean the inside of the bottle that often. The lid, I just wash with soap and water between uses.
To clean: Put two drops of bleach in the bottle, fill with purified water. Let sit for ~10 minutes. Then open the spout and let it drain through. Use a small diameter brush and a little bleach (same brush I use for my hiking water bladder mouth piece) to clean the drinking spout. After that, rinse with clean water and put in 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. Fill again. Let sit 10 minutes. Drain some water through the spout. Finally, rinse all. You're ready to go!",positive

I got it to bring with me to college in the coral and pinkish color, and was astounded by the quality! It's made of sustainable metal that does indeed keep it from getting warm when something cold is in it and having condensation when the ice eventually melts!

It comes with a normal cap (not pictured in my review) and the sports cap, which I included a picture of, and two straws! The sports cap is designed for colder liquids, the normal cap for warmer ones - which is super easy to use too!

Recently I brought the bottle with me to a picnic at a park and the ice placed inside early afternoon lasted until well after 7 in the evening, even with changing the water when I finished it! Definitely highly recommend this bottle and seller, so I bought more bottles for my family from them :))

Just to note, it's a bit hard to hold the larger bottles, so they sell handles separately which I've ordered to match each of the bottles I've gotten so far 😄

I was nervous to make the investment because I didn't realize how much was actually *needed* in a solid bottle- one I can count on for a long time.

I'm thought it was silly at first, that many reviewers commented that it enforces their water drinking and they drink more as a result of ownership. I can attest that it's true! Seeing a bottle I take everywhere, that looks nice, reminds me to drink! My water intake has greatly increased since I've owned it.

It keeps ice forever! It definitely does depend on the size of the cube so I won't stand behind any claim of how long. But I'm shocked at how well it keeps cold and there's been ice in my bottle for 48+ hours.

It does scratch rather easily so I try not to let it roll around and always have the handle attached. I haven't dropped it, so I can't speak on whether or not it dents.

I'm glad I chose to invest in some of the attachments, like the rubber bottom and braided handle. I LOVE the way it looks and I never forget it. I do notice my straw top makes a funny noise (almost like a squeaking when drinking) that I wish it didn't and my bf def knows when I'm drinking from it as a result. (This bottle is literally in my bed at night, all nights). So, that's a bummer but I'm wondering if it's a fluke. I haven't seen anyone else review on the same issue. I noticed, along with other reviwers, that the bottom does tend to slide off occasionally, but I guess, for me, that's a low priority, bcuz I always notice what it looks like without. But that's not to say, I wish it just stay on. And perhaps would benefit from being slightly more fitted. I believe the rubber on has helped some possible damage that may have resulted otherwise so I'm glad to have it.

Grateful for the reviews that really swayed my choice in choosing this specific one bcuz I'm really happy with it.",positive

Finally, I saw reviews where they dent or scratch easy, well any metal bottle being dropped or bumped up against something will do that. So far for dents and scratches...I had two scratches of my own doing, simple fix...take regular (not gel) toothpaste and rub it into the scratch with a soft warm damp cloth for about 2-3 minutes and viola, the scratches disappear. Don't forget to rinse off the remaining toothpaste. Finally, these DO NOT LEAK, that was extremely important to me. The bottom line is this is a damn good product : )",positive

80,Sports & Outdoors,Callaway 2021 Supersoft Golf Balls 12B PK,$16.60 - $54.99,5,"I been on the hunt for a ball I can call my own and something in the under $30 bracket. I have played Callaway balls in the past and this one had me intrigued. After watching a few reviews on You Tube and reading a few Amazon reviews I decided to give these a try.

I have tried most of the brand names around that price point and a few others like Seed and Cut. The one I have sort of settled on is the Titleist Tru Feel. It has the soft feel and sound I like and the price is right - but I don't love it. The Cut Matte (in the same orange) has a good feel and a similar outer covering to the Supersoft, but the price point is a bit high, especially if you include the shipping fees, so replacing all my current balls would be costly - plus I don't love it.

As I understand it a lot of higher end premium balls are made to be higher compression with a harder outer cover, that do not over spin when hit with woods and irons, but still have good spin characteristics around the green with higher spin rates. But that hard outer cover also accounts for the clipping sound they tend to make which I am not a fan of. Plus that sound resonates through the club too so the feel is not as soft - at least to me anyway. You can just drop them on a concrete surface and clearly hear the difference - which is my first test when looking at golf balls. The aforementioned Tru Feel has a nice soft feel and sound that I like, so for all practical purposes it is my main ball, and I have a lot of them, but like I said I do not love it and I want to love my golf balls. Well the Callaway Supersoft might just warrant me making one last a change.

Before I go into my test results of the Supersoft a short disclaimer; right now I am not able to take full swings (doctor's orders) due to a pinched nerve in my neck, so my comments in this review are based on what I have experienced whilst putting and chipping (out to ~60 yards) in my yard and at the range. That said, how a ball performs when chipping and pitching is my main area of focus when I evaluate golf balls. I have never gotten significantly more distance from one ball or another so it is not a factor for me. Now if I do end up seeing some distance gains with a full iron swing, as some other reviewer around my age (66) have noted, I will update this review.

The Supersoft has a very soft rubbery outer shell - which might put some golfers off immediately. It is a very soft feel in the hands and translates to a similar feel off the club face...which I really like. On the downside, it is more prone to holding onto dirt and smudges than the smooth surface most other golf balls have. It does not appear to be more prone to nicks or slices, but to be honest, I have never damaged a golf ball when hitting it, so I don't really factor that in. Along with the soft feel, the sound the ball makes when chipping is a very gratifying thunk. Edging out the Tru Feel and all others I have tried. I use a chipper around the greens and the ball comes off that club real nice with a consistent roll. So far in my testing it outperforms the Tru Feel in this regard - which is a huge plus.

On the greens the ball rolls true, which one would expect, but it does appear to need a little more putter speed to have the ball travel the same distance as a smooth covered ball...and it slows down a bit quicker as well. Someone else had mentioned this in a review and I found it hard to believe, but it appears to be correct. Nothing extreme, but it takes a little more of a wack for sure. For me this is a good thing though. I tend to leave balls short so it makes me give it a little more, which works out well since it seems to slow more too - strikes a good balance for me. Again beating out the Tru Feel.

The other plus is the orange color. I have used yellow for some time, but chose the orange when testing the Cut Matte and really started to like it. It's easier for me to see in flight and when looking for a ball on or off the fairway. You guessed it....the Tru Feel does not come in orange.

I am not at the point yet where I will go out and buy three dozen more golf balls to replace all the Tru Feel balls I have, but I have not been as impressed with a golf ball until the Supersoft. I am a big believer in having only one brand of ball in my golf bag. My short game is good enough that having a consistent feel when the ball is struck or rolls when it hits the green, is important to me - one less intangible IMO. It will definitely come down to one of the two and I suspect the Callaway Supersoft will be the ball I fall in love with.

The price is right so give them a try and decide for yourself. It will likely be the most unique golf ball experience you have even had.",positive
81,Sports & Outdoors,Callaway 2021 Supersoft Golf Balls 12B PK,$16.60 - $54.99,5,"You can't really pay any attention to manufacturer's claims when it comes to golf balls. They all say they're faster, longer, and have great greenside control. I'm 47 and a 4 Handicap at the moment, playing from the regular men's tees. My driver swing speed is around 92-95 mph, creeping down to the high 80s when the back is acting up. In other words, exactly at the average male swing speed with driver. This usually means roughly 205-215 carry with a decent strike, and totals that range widely from 210 to 245. At this speed and below, golf balls go pretty much the same distance with the driver. The only distance gains I've had in golf (or seen anyone else have) have been through improving technique. Unless you're playing a 15-year old driver. In which case you should really get one of these new drivers, because they are amazing.

Low-compression surlyn golf balls like the Supersoft spin less and they go a little straighter and carry further with IRONS. Again: at 93 mph and down, all golf balls go pretty much the same distance with driver. Given the standard deviation in most tests - it's a wash. You will not see a benefit from a firm, fast ball until you're pushing 100 mph and up. The ball speed might be slightly higher for us with firmer balls, but at 90 mph, that TP5x is not carrying further off the tee. What it WILL do is come up 5-7 yards short with your irons. But with driver - all the same. All the time in reviews I see people writing, ""I picked up 10-20 yards when I switched to such-and-such ball!"" No. They did not. These people are either lying, or delusional, or have highly selective memories.

Basically, the fast swinger has a conundrum: he (or she - looking at you, Jessica Korda) wants a ball that spins super low with driver, then spins a reasonable amount with mid-irons without flying too high, and is SUPER spinny around the greens. This means a three, four, or five-piece ball that's expensive and difficult to engineer and manufacture, and one with an expensive cast urethane cover. Fortunately for them, many of these people are pros and don't have to pay for golf balls.

All the SLOW swinger needs, on the other hand, is a ball that is low-spinning and high flying on pretty much every shot. We want low spin with driver for carry and roll. We want low spin with irons to get more carry. Also, the average slicer (we'll call it a fade) is already ADDING too much spin to their iron shots, making them go offline and end up short. And around the greens? Nope, we really don't need spin there either. We need to be bumping and running and getting the ball close by controlling trajectory. And stop hitting flop shots from three feet off the green and trying to carry everything right to the flag. For the love of God, I beg you, sell that 60º wedge and learn to use a pitching wedge and a putter around the greens.

And the good news is that such a ball is not only cheap to design and produce, it's also more consistent from ball to ball. I've played the Supersoft for about a year, and I know what it's going to do. No surprises. This new ball feels the same and the performance is the same through the bag. And it feels really good. I'll play a Prov1 or a TP5 from time to time, and they feel just fine. But the ""X"" tour balls feel like rocks to me. Unless I hit it in the middle. Every ball is soft when you hit the middle.

I'd like to dispel another common myth that gets passed around. Ionomer/Surlyn balls are NOT more durable than urethane balls. The ionomer used for golf ball covers is hard. When it gets scuffed, it gets scuffed badly. And it stays scuffed. Because urethane is softer and more resilient, it absorbs a lot of the impact from trees, wedges with new grooves, and even cart paths. I've had urethane balls that hit a cart path HARD and I could barely tell where it had hit. But then they really ought to be durable for $48 a dozen.

So in a nutshell, the new Supersoft feels great, does what it's supposed to do, and it's cheap. And I think the new logo/alignment graphic looks pretty cool.",positive

Wanted to start of by stating that I'm a new golfer so I do not know much about these Golf balls other than that they served their purpose.

There were some instances where I thought I had lost the ball, but thanks to the green color I was able to find it in the brush.

84,Sports & Outdoors,Callaway 2021 Supersoft Golf Balls 12B PK,$16.60 - $54.99,4,"I bought these balls because of the positive reviews and because I was tired of losing $4 balls in the woods. I also liked the color because it is unique and it truly stands out (at least at the courses I play). I am currently a 15 handicap and I have a very average swing speed for my age (55) of around 95 to 100 mph. The main pro of this ball to me is the price, so if you tend to lose a lot of balls this is a great choice. On the other hand, don't expect a premium feel or a premium performance. Off the tee these balls travel significantly less distance than a Pro V1 for me. My test is not scientific, but several times I have hit two drives alternating between this ball and a Pro V1 and to my surprise, with identical feeling strikes, the Pro V1 travels 20 to 30 yards further. I have read other reviews calling B.S. on distance claims, but this is my experience. These balls are fine for one round but they will get badly scuffed assuming you don't lose them first. Bottom line is that I recommend this ball if you want value and you go through a lot of balls. If you improve to the point where you don't lose more than 1 or 2 balls a round I would recommend going to a premium ball. They will last longer and perform better.",positive

100,Sports & Outdoors,Hydro Flask Wide Mouth Bottle with Flex Cap,$24.47 - $109.95,4,"This is my second Hydro Flask. My original is a 32oz that is great for longer times away from home, but I wanted something easy for work & coffee on the go so I decided to get a smaller version. In the family we now have five. Never have I had any of them leak or develop condensation on the outside. These things are amazing & just work! They work even better if you pre-chill or heat the inside prior to adding your drink (use some ice water or heated water from the stove for a little while before loading your beverage of choice). Both of my Hydro Flasks seem lighter than my 18oz Yeti which is nice when full but does raise some concerns about the amount of abuse it may be able to take if dropped though I have yet to drop one.

It loses a star because I have two complaints about Hydro Flasks.

1. The fully painted bottom may be prone to scratching and chipping without a boot but if you put a boot on it sticks to my backpack pockets and cup holders.

2. This is really just personal preference, but I am not a fan of the jumping person logo and really can’t stand it smack in the middle of the bottle. I prefer a clean look. Can’t really cover it up & keep it looking clean. Yeti, still having a logo on the bottle, has better logo placement, out of the way and a bottom that won’t chip (may scratch but won’t remove paint).

Overall the Hydro Flasks are great water bottles and I would recommend them to anyone. They seriously keep my coffee so hot I can only sip it for HOURS if I keep the lid on and it easily holds ice overnight.",positive

Keeps my drink cool as long as I screw the lid on tight.

It doesn’t leak. It doesn’t scratch easy. I’ve had mine for about 3 or 4month. And I use it nearly everyday. And I am not the most delicate handler, so as you can see it holds up well. Never dropped it on concrete, but I’ve dropped it plenty on other surfaces.

120,Sports & Outdoors,"Sweet Sweat Waist Trimmer, by Sports Research - Sweat Band Increases Stomach Temp to Cut Water Weight",$23.95 - $30.29,4,"The waist trainer does exactly what you want it to, produce more sweat to eventually get a smaller waist/stomach. However, I've been using this waist trainer for two weeks now, and have had a reaction that has not gone away. This is moreso my fault, as I did read reviews prior to purchasing this item. When I first wore the waist trainer, I wore only a sports bra and my shorts, so the material was on naked skin. When I finished my workout, after taking the waist trainer off, I noticed that I had small red bumps/a rash on part of my back, as seen in the photo. After noticing that, immediately I looked into the material it is made from, and found it is made from neoprene, a synthetic rubber. After figuring this out, I then decided to continue use of the waist trainer, but over my clothes, so I wore a full coverage slim fit shirt each time, and then the waist trainer on top. Yesterday and today, I noticed that the bumps are still on my back even after using it over a shirt, and ensuring I and the trainer are clean with each new use before and afterward. The product itself is not a problem at all. It is simply made from a material that may cause a reaction to some, and also, you are sweating underneath the trainer, so with the combination of the material and sweat, a reaction is not surprising. I still give it a high rating because it does allow you to exert more sweat, thus I would think it would produce great results for anyone that can use it without getting a reaction. Please before buying, fully read through the product materials, etc. Just want to make others more aware because a reaction may and can happen.",positive
121,Sports & Outdoors,"Sweet Sweat Waist Trimmer, by Sports Research - Sweat Band Increases Stomach Temp to Cut Water Weight",$23.95 - $30.29,5,"I've used this product and the sweat gel for several months now. I figured now would be a good time to give my honest opinion.

I wear this to work, as well as to the gym. It's comfortable enough that it can be worn for several hours at a time.

First, I tried wearing it without the sweat gel. The product made me sweat, but it wasn't a noticeable amount. As soon as I added the sweat gel, though? Whoa mama, what a difference it made.

Now, here is where my review will get a bit conflicting.

I workout a lot and thought that this product, as advertised, would help me lose a few inches off my waist. Personally, I have not experienced any weight loss while using this product whatsoever. In fact, I've been stuck at the same weight (205 lbs) that I've been stuck at for a few years, now. It's kind of frustrating that nothing seems to work.

But it does as it promises: it makes you sweat, especially when combined with the sweat gel.

I will say, though, that since I started to use this product, my posture has dramatically improved. I no longer have severe back pain from years of constantly slouching. Your parents are right, slouching as a teen really affects your body as you get older lol.

Before I used this product, I couldn't sit up and do something as simple as watch TV for more than 10 minutes at a time without sharp pains in my back. Since I started using this product, I have little to no issues when it comes to back pain.

So, although I haven't experienced any weight loss while using this product, I will continue to use it regularly.",positive
122,Sports & Outdoors,"Sweet Sweat Waist Trimmer, by Sports Research - Sweat Band Increases Stomach Temp to Cut Water Weight",$23.95 - $30.29,5,"I just got this. It came in the mail today. I was sitting in my room with no ac on, with 84% humidity outside. I couldn’t believe it! I literally felt the sweat around my waist. Then, I went to the gym and did a 30 minute stationary bike w/out. I came home, took this bad boy off and was amazed with how much sweat this SS absorbed !

I ordered a small bc I wear clothes 0-4. The small fit perfectly. Moreover, the material- a +! I have sensitive skin and break out in welts and can get rashes all over my body if I wear certain materials. I was surprised that although I sweated like a person who sat in a sauna, my skin didn’t break out !

Please note: regarding pain relief, I put a 1 star since I haven’t or intended to use it for pain management. No insult to the product. But it didn’t pertain to my needs.

Another thing I love about this product is that the company included a mesh wash bag for you to put it in when you do need to wash it. *See photo above. That was so considerate of the company. It will be easy to “find” the Sweet Sweat as I do my laundry.

I have so many clothes I put in the mesh bags while doing my laundry and so I am thankful that this product came with its own separate one.

Lastly, I was not paid for this review and most importantly, I am reviewing this after using it for the first time. So only time will tell how effective it will be for my marathon training needs and goals. But so far so good!",positive

I used it during my workout and felt a lot of support in my lower back and tummy. At first I was like ok, I don’t feel any different. I don’t think it’s doing anything. I took it off and instantly I felt the cold breeze from all the sweat I was drenched in. This belt was soaked! I worked out without it, to test the theory of do I actually sweat the same amount?

126,Sports & Outdoors,"Sweet Sweat Waist Trimmer, by Sports Research - Sweat Band Increases Stomach Temp to Cut Water Weight",$23.95 - $30.29,5,"I've been hearing about these waist thingies for years and I've always been a skeptic. Last year when my husband and I started working out regularly he got one (just the waist trainer) to wear during workouts. He would always laugh laugh laugh when he took it off at home because the sweat just poured off. The only thing that rolled on me were my eyes when I saw girls using this in the gym, oh please. The only way to burn fat was through cardio/aerobic exercise, not some magic cloth with pomade.

SO??? So what if you sweat? There are also fat people who live close to the equator. Case proven.

But then in February of 2017 we got ourselves a personal trainer. Although we had been working out for months, nothing worked until we got our meal plan in check. To date, he has lost 30lbs and I have lost 28lbs, without the waist trainer. My husband still had his little pooch tummy and I, well I still have a long way to go. But then a few of my trainer's clients are figure competitors and I saw them wearing this waist thingy and using Sweet Sweat. I got curious. I asked one of the girls about it (through IG though, I was too shy to ask in person) and she said all of the trainer's competitors work out in them (men and women, plus using the Sweet Sweat) especially a few months before a competition to have that extra edge. She warned me that she's not sure if it burns fat or just springs water, but the results are definitely visible as opposed to when she doesn't use it.

So then I was intrigued. For about two weeks I read about 15 pages of these Amazon reviews, plus the reviews from GNC and other places, and then got it for myself. The smell of the cream (the sample that comes with it) is quite awful (IMO), it smells like someone had already sweat into the cream. I've tried my husbands waist trainer and it is rather stiff while this one is kind of soft and spongy. I wear a size 18 so I got a XLarge, but really I could've gotten a Large. I couldn't get a tight fit. I had excess cream on my hand so I just spread it on my bare arm. But then I remembered all the one-star reviews and I put Vaseline on my other arm (just to see). (By the way, I'm not sure how much cream to put on, but it seems like there are about 4-6 uses of cream in the sample.)

Four minutes into my workout is when it kicked in. It wasn't even heat I felt, but ice cold. I was on a Helix machine and the coldness wore off after a while so at times I forgot it was even there. I was ready to be a one-star reviewer. After 35 minutes I took it off and there it was. Water poured down the front of my yoga pants! Never in my life have I sweat on my tummy before. My Vaseline arm was shiny but my Sweet Sweat arm was wet with sweat like I'd come out of the shower (just my bare arms, I wasn't wearing the arm bands). The directions say to put an ""ample"" amount but I remembered another one-star review that accused the wetness of just being the cream so I didn't put on much. But here's the kicker, when I first started doing the research my husband went back to wearing his, and darn if he isn't finally losing his little pooch. Mind you, he has never used the cream and he uses a different brand of waist trainer (I think it's the TNT Pro Series?). In fact, yesterday he used BenGay with his trainer and while he did sweat, it also made the house smell like BenGay. Not romantic. I got him his own thing of Sweet Sweat today.

So no way am I going to say it burns fat because there simply is no scientific empirical evidence that claims this, and it's not regulated by the FDA (I'm a professor, so I really researched this). But I love this product because (1) I love to sweat HARD when I work out; (2) it feels oddly satisfying to see all that water roll out and (3) I can testify to the change in my husband's belly -- change that wasn't there without the trainer, even with eating right and working out 6 days a week. Don't know if it's water or fat that is leaving his mid-section. So... if there is the slightest chance that all the heat it creates might even burn a smidgen of fat along with all that water, then it's worth it to wear every time I work out, for reasons (1) and (2).

I'm with other reviewers, I can't imagine the one-star reviewers saying that they didn't sweat because it's shocking, the water that you'll expel. I'm not advanced enough yet for the saran-wrap + trainer, but maybe if I ever get down to competitor size, I might be convinced!",positive

130,Sports & Outdoors,Intex Dura-Beam Deluxe Comfort Plush Air Mattress Series with Internal Pump,$41.25 - $169.55,5,"I bought the queen-sized 18in air mattress to save money while traveling for a summer internship. I was at first concerned that I was in for uncomfortable nights, given I had no bedframe, but I am extremely happy with my purchase.

The mattress comes with a convenient built-in electric air pump and a thin traveling pouch. I top up my air mattress every week and a half or so when it becomes a bit softer than my liking. All this entails is plugging the cord into the wall, turning the dial for a few seconds, then tucking the cord back into its compartment.

18in is an extremely sufficient height for a full-sized bed: around twice as tall as the largest traditional air mattress I've slept on in my youth. I put the mattress directly on the floor and was able to sit comfortably on it as though it were a normal bed (I'm a little under 6'). As claimed by the manufacturer, the mattress is very supportive, even at the edges. That being said, I did have a queen, and you will of course have a larger percentage of supportive area the larger size you purchase (as the supportive center area is larger relative to the area of the edges).

Given air is a poor conductor of heat, the air mattress kept me nice and cool during the night. I wrapped a fitted sheet around the top half of the mattress (it won't fit around the entire thing), threw a thin blanket and comforter on top with a couple pillows and had a great sleeping experience. I will be sad to give the mattress away when I leave (buying another one is cheaper than checking it in on a flight), but will certainly be a customer again in the future. I am confident you will enjoy this product.",positive

It has not leaked (although you will see a small amount of what seems to be air loss as the vinyl material stretches over the first few uses). You will also need to find your own ""sweet spot"" of firmness (the built-in air pump does not shut off automatically). One very minor downside-it seemed to me that once inflated, the mattress had a slight outwardly rounded shape (convex), so you might feel like you roll to one side or the other, but this was a minor inconvenience when compared to the fact that it inflated easily, was reasonably comfortable, and did not leak!",positive

The queen is a luxery mattress that sleeps comfortably and is easy to inflate/deflate/store. The twin is easy to inflate/deflate/store, but is a bit wobbly left/right when sleeping on it.

This Amazon Basics yoga mat provides ample cushioning. Part of my stretching requires me to lay on my stomach. i can do so quite comfortably on this mat and even used the partially folded up end to support my right foot. as for durability, we’ll see, but i’m not planning on carrying this anywhere right now. Am very happy with this purchase, and it was the least expensive mat. Would have liked a color but black is just fine for me.",positive

142,Sports & Outdoors,Amazon Basics 1/2-Inch Extra Thick Exercise Yoga Mat,$18.68 - $49.02,4,"As soon as I opened the box, the strong smell hit me. Like others said it really smells like cat pee lol. I rolled it out and put it outside for a few hours and the smell went away! I noticed immediately it had a bunch of little holes like as if it’s been used (I don’t think it has but it’s weird) I’m only planning on doing things like yoga on this mat so I won’t be returning it but if I was planning on doing more rigorous activity I would’ve definitely retuned it because those holes have potential to get bigger with a lot of use. Besides that it’s perfectly padded and I love the length

I'm fine with this. I don' t have any idea what more you could ask for gor a yoga mat. It should be fine for most peoples needs unless perhaps they are much wider than usual, in which case get two and sit them side by side then two more if also very tall.

I put my finger through the silicone hole on lid to carry. I own a 2003 Toyota Corolla and doesn’t fit in the cup holder. May fit in newer cars. That is the only thing I don’t like.

The pretty blue I got reminds me of crystal clear waters which makes me want to drink more water.

It feels reasonably strong but you never know. In the meantime I like that the bottle doesn't have silly straws or mechanisms that just get moldy and messy or break or lose pieces. The large opening for filling / adding ice is great. The perfect size mouth opening is great for chugging or drinking regular. The carry ring is convenient and i like that it's rubbery that can help absorb an impact if dropped. On the downside is that the measurement markings on the outside rubbed off within a month or 2 of getting it. That's rather dissapointing but otherwise the bottle's been great.,positive

That being said, I walk 4 miles every morning and then I work a job where I am on my feet all day…. I have experienced chafing before and it really hurts but I just tolerated it until yesterday. I could barely walk last night because my inner thighs were so irritated. I knew I wasn’t going to be able to workout this morning if I didn’t get something shipped overnight from Amazon… I found two different creams from the same company- one for foot/ankle blisters and one for general chafing. They both had great reviews so I decided to give them a shot. I walked the dogs this morning before they arrived and I didn’t think I was going to be able to do any walking today- that’s how much pain I was in. The creams arrived a couple hours later. I applied them on my inner thighs and heels and began my 4-mile walk. Let me tell you, I had my best average mile time since I began working out months ago! I could barely feel the irritation and I will never workout without these creams again! If you experience chafing, buy this stuff. It simply works.

It was an absolute game-changer, and I've been using it for over a year at this point (on my 2nd stick now). I can go full 12 hour shifts without chafe and now I don't loathe doing certain tasks at work that have me hustling or walking a lot.

It is unscented, and applies just like deodorant, just put it where you need it. It'll feel kinda like a waxy coating but once you start working it'll warm up and feel kinda lubricious, which takes some getting used to, but if the options are that feeling or being afraid to sit down after a long shift the choice is clear for me.

180,Sports & Outdoors,Fitbit Charge 5,$117.96 - $240.96,4,"UPDATE May 2022: I'm still a big fan of this product and have made a few updates to my initial review(s), but the bottom line is that it's held up to initial impressions. I ended up knocking off a star just because there are a few improvements that can be made, but it's still very solid.

==============================

I purchased the Fitbit Charge 5 as an upgrade from my Charge 3. I skipped the Charge 4 since I didn't really need/want the new features of that model, but the allure of a color display with the same lengthy, weeklong battery life was enough to make me upgrade to the Charge 5. I won't cover all the features of the Charge 5 since there are plenty of other places that go into great detail, and I may update this review after I get more use out of it.

WHO SHOULD BUY A FITBIT CHARGE?
The Fitbit Charge is great if your primary use is as a lightweight fitness tracker. I prefer the Fitbit Charge over the Apple Watch and other smartwatches due to its lightweight nature, weeklong battery life, and my lack of need for fancier smartwatch functionality. If you like the extra bells & whistles of a smartwatch and don't mind a heavier watch that needs to be charged every day or three, then you may want to skip the Fitbit Charge. Also, if you're a die-hard Apple user who needs integration with the Apple Health app, then you'll also need to look elsewhere because there's no data flowing between the apps in either direction; thankfully, the Fitbit app is quite good and does integrate with a number of other apps.

IS IT WORTH UPGRADING FROM THE CHARGE 3/4?
It mainly depends on how much you value a better, color display. The MSRP on a Charge 5 is $180 (though, I'm sure the sale price will drop during the holiday season), while the MSRP on a Charge 4 is $150; though, at this point, everyone's selling the Charge 4 (and 3) well below MSRP, especially if you buy refurbished.

IMPRESSIONS:
- Initial setup was fairly smooth. I had to connect it to the charger to get it started up. Transitioning from my Charge 3 to the Charge 5 in the app was easy enough. There was a firmware update notice (the firmware enables the EDA sensor), and that update was a little buggy & required a few attempts before it succeeded (at one point, I needed to reboot my Fitbit).
- ECG monitor became available via firmware update 11/9/2021. I had some connection issues while trying to run it but got it to work eventually. I don't have any arrhythmia issues, so while it's a nifty feature, it's ultimately useless for me.
- The Daily Readiness Score also became available 11/9/2021. It's only available for Premium subscribers.
It takes 4 days before it starts functioning & a couple weeks to ""tune"". Overall, I'd say this is not terribly useful. If you work out on a consistent basis & get a decent amount of sleep, then it's always a great day to work out! That is, you'll remain in the Good to Excellent range (30 & above). For reference, I typically work out 4-5 days/week spending 30-40 min on cardio & 30-40 min on weights, which ends up being 110-160 Zone Minutes on those days when combined with whatever other Zone Minutes I rack up when not working out. But if you take a week off or so & return to working out, then you may dip below 30 into the Low score range where it says you should prioritize recovery. I also noticed that if you forget to wear your Fitbit to bed, it can throw off your score; it sent my score plummeting for no good reason otherwise.
Also, perhaps not surprisingly, the Readiness Score seems to be primarily reflective of your cardio workout. It will classify my ""Activity"" as ""Light"" on some days when I spend a fair amount of time on weight training that doesn't really sustain an elevated heart rate (and less on cardio).
- There's no longer a ""home"" button on the side of the display to ""Return"" or access additional menus. This took a little time to adjust to, but I'm generally okay with it, especially since the touchscreen is noticeably more responsive than the Charge 3. Now, you must swipe right to return to the prior screen, and you can also double-tap in most cases to return to the home screen; though, the double-tap can be finicky. Would I prefer to have a ""home"" button again? Yes. (Now, the sides of the device used for the EDA sensor & ECG monitor).
- The display is much, much better than the Charge 3/4. Brighter with much higher resolution. and of course, color.
- The display has 3 brightness settings; however, the difference between dim, normal, and max is rather subtle; they're all pretty bright, and this is unfortunate because it's a little too bright for dark rooms in my opinion. I liked the dim, auto, and normal settings on my Charge 3 much better. Hopefully, this is something that will be fixed in a future firmware update (assuming, the Charge 5 still has the sensor that allows for an ""auto"" setting).
- The ""up to 7 days"" battery life is not a lie. The battery life lasts me about a week with my brightness set to ""normal"", which is the same as my old Charge 3. I do not use the built-in GPS nor the always-on display (both of which are a significant drains on the battery), but I do average 6-8 hours/week of active exercise time. And, since the ""dim"" brightness setting is bright enough for me, I use it all the time, which translates to even better battery life. Pretty amazing considering the brighter, color display.
- The Charge 5 does a better job of automatically turning the display on at the turn of the wrist. My Charge 3 wouldn't always turn on or would require me to turn my wrist more than what felt natural. The Apple Watch is still superior with regard to automatically turning on when looking since there is a slight delay with the Charge 5 after turning your wrist (and, it still doesn't always turn on).
- The wrist band that's included is a nicer feeling silicone material instead of the plastic one that came with the Charge 3/4. The ""small"" strap on the Charge 5 band is also smaller than the ""small"" on the Charge 3/4. On the Charge 5, I use the last or next to last notch on the band (i.e. the strap is basically at its largest, most expanded size), but with the Charge 3 strap, I still had 3 or 4 empty notches to work with. Not a big deal since they include small & large bands, but something to consider if you purchase additional bands. I did end up purchasing the Sport band, which does have more notches to work with. Be sure to use Fitbit's sizing tool on their website before purchasing extra wrist bands since they do vary based on which one you get.
- The heart rate monitoring is nice & accurate like the Charge 3. I run on a treadmill with a Tickr X (1st gen) chest strap, and after the first few minutes of running when my heart rate is more stable, the readings between the Charge 5 & Tickr X are either the same or only off by a bpm or two. It's less accurate when doing sprints/HIIT since it tends to lag behind the Tickr X, but it's still in the ballpark (albeit, delayed).
- The EDA sensor seems like a waste for me. Along the lines of the guided breathing exercises in the Charge 3, it's just something that I don't care to use, and I question its accuracy/validity anyway.
- I'm not sure if this was introduced with the Charge 4, but there's a daily Stress Management Score now. The number seems fairly meaningless, since it's somewhat of a mystery as to how it's calculated. Yes, Fitbit tells you what the general parameters are (heart rate, sleep, activity) & premium members get to see how the sub-scores feed into the overall score (see below), but in the end, it just seems pretty meaningless to me.
- I think this may have changed with the Charge 4, but it no longer tracks the number of floors you've climbed (no big deal as it was wildly inaccurate), and it counts Active Zone Minutes instead of Active Minutes now. Fitbit's website has more details on Active Minutes vs Active Zone minutes.
- There's 23 clock faces to choose from. Most of them only display one stat (e.g. HR, steps, etc.) at a time (though, you can usually cycle through them all by tapping the screen), which is unfortunate. Hopefully, they'll add more data-rich clock faces, but overall, it's nice to see them making use of the colorful, higher resolution display.
- The charging cable functions a lot better since it magnetically clips to the Fitbit (like an Apple Watch does to its charger). I believe it's the same charging cable as the Fitbit Luxe.
- My Charge 5 somewhat regularly (once every day or two) has trouble syncing with the app. It has gotten better over time & usually just requires me to refresh the app (by dragging down at the top of the screen of the phone app). At worst, I'll need to restart the app, and once I had to restart my Fitbit device itself. Overall, not a big deal. Just an occasional annoyance.

FITBIT PREMIUM MEMBERSHIP:
I generally dislike paying for subscriptions since the cost of them can add up to something pretty substantial over time. The Fitbit Premium Membership isn't exactly cheap at $10/month or $80/year; though, you get 6 months for free with the purchase of your Charge 5. If you actually use many/all of its features, then it may be worthwhile, but for me, it isn't (i.e. I won't be paying for membership when my free trial runs out in a week or so). The Daily Readiness Score & Health Metrics Dashboard are the only premium features I routinely looked at, but I question their overall usefulness/practicality. Here's a rundown of what you get for your money:
- Daily Readiness Score: see comments above in IMPRESSIONS section - in short, not terribly useful.
- Health Metrics Dashboard (see attached pic): graphs/data for Breathing Rate, Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Skin Temperature, Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), Resting Heart Rate (RHR). The RHR data is already available for non-Premium users & you can view you most recent SpO2 reading on the device, but the rest of the stats appear to only be available to Premium members. The graphs are actually kinda crummy; there's two types: 1) one graph allows you to vary the time scale to view 7, 30, or 90 days, but you have to visually line up the dot with the values on the y-axis to determine the actual reading for each dot, and 2) another type of graph shows 7 days at a time with individual readings on the graph, but you can't change the time frame/scale of this graph. It would be a lot nicer if they made these graphs larger & interactive (so you could change the time scale on the fly & tap on the data points to see the reading).
- Wellness Report: You can generate a PDF wellness report to be emailed. While it provides a summary of HR, weight, activity, & sleep trends over the course of 1, 3, 6, & 12 months, it's lame that you can't just view this directly in the app.
- Stress Management Score details (see attached pic): extra details on your score including the sub-scores that feed into it: Responsiveness, Exertion Balance, & Sleep Patterns.... still not sure how meaningful any of this is.
- Sleep Score details (see attached pic): there's a different detailed view of your sleep score; you get sub-scores for Time Asleep, Deep and REM, and Restoration, but I believe all the graphs are the same for non-premium users, so I'm not sure that this offers much more insight that the non-premium view does; I suppose you get to see how much each sub-score accounts for the overall score.
- Instructional stuff: There are various workout routines, guided meditations, food programs, & sleep programs you can look up & do.
- Games & Challenges: You can participate in various fitness games/challenges, which might motivate you to work out more.

181,Sports & Outdoors,Fitbit Charge 5,$117.96 - $240.96,2,"The Fitbit Charge5 offers a host of body measurements to help you keep healthy, but many are experimental or poorly measured, leaving considerable doubt about their utility. In some ways this “watch” is a step backward, as my 20-year-old Casio shows me the time (date and elevation) continuously (no need to tap the Casio to see the display), is easily read in bright sunlight (good luck with the Fitbit), is waterproof, and it never needs charging.
What the Fitbit adds is motion detection (it counts the swinging of your arms as you walk and calls them “steps”) and heartbeat rate (measured optically from the periodic widening of your arteries). Walking is really good for you, especially as you age, as it maintains bone density and promotes blood flow and healing. Couch potatoes impair their health, especially over the long run; the Fitbit might motivate you to keep moving to keep healthy. The main flaw in this device is that it treats almost any arm motion as equivalent to walking. I get hundreds or even thousands of “steps” from arm motions when I’m not walking; for example, grating cheese, or varnishing boards. Driving on some dirt roads are often credited as “steps”. In aggregate, my Charge5 has awarded me 15,000 “steps” in a single day for activities that I did without shaking a leg.
But what really sticks in my craw is the Fitbit’s misreading of heartbeats. How do I know that it is a misreading? After all, I can easily see the number of steps I take in a day, but heartbeats are not so readily counted. I set the Charge5’s screen to one of the choices that allows me to see the heartbeat rate anytime I turn the screen on; then over many weeks I repeatedly bicycled two 5+ mile rides, one on pavement and the other a gravel road. Both include 10% grades, uphill and down, and I took note of the reported heartbeat rate. Much of the time the graphs shown in the Fitbit app corresponded to what I observed throughout the ride, but occasionally the graphs were wildly in error. I reported the problem to Fitbit and they unhesitating gave me a new watch, but the new watch makes the same mistakes. I conclude that their sensors are just not up to the task.
Fitbit groups heartbeat rates into four classes, which correspond closely with my physical exertions: 1) resting, 2) active but not breathing hard (e.g. walking on the flats: Fitbit calls this “fat burning”), 3) breathing vigorously (pedaling steeply uphill; Fitbit calls it the “cardio” zone), and 4) gasping for breath (working harder than my body can sustain: “peak”). “Fat-burning” is mildly beneficial for cardiac conditioning and therefore Fitbit awards 1 “zone-minute” for each actual minute spent with a heartbeat that is 40-59% of the way from one’s personal minimum (measured from your resting rate) to one’s personal maximum (calculated from your age). “Cardio” is the zone above that, 60-84% of the way from your personal minimum to your personal maximum, and peak is the zone above 84%. The Charge5 awards you 2 “zone-minutes” for each minute you spend above 60%, but it notes that time spent above 84% can be damaging to your body and therefore should be entered only occasionally. For example, from hundreds of measurements of my heartrate I know that at the top of 10% grades on my bicycle, I sometimes enter the “peak” (=>84%) zone, but as the incline eases off I rapidly return to the unequivocally beneficial “cardio” zone. The core function of the Charge5 is the game of accumulating zone-minutes through vigorous activity. The watch has innumerable cheery messages that it sends you whenever you are accumulating zone-minutes, and it gently chides you every hour that you fail to do so.
Here are some examples of how badly the Charge5 measures heartrate. I was driving through a calm residential neighborhood to go bicycling, parked, strapped on my Charge5, and stepped out of the car, when the Fitbit congratulated me on earning cardio zone-minutes (in reality, I would not have yet even entered fat-burning). On my daily 30 minute ride on gravel, my Fitbit once calculated that I averaged 150 beats per minute (BPM) over the entire 30 minutes, when experience with that exact ride shows that I only occasionally exceed 120 bpm for a minute or two. For my age, 150 bpm is considered the maximum heartrate I can achieve; to sustain that for 30 minutes would presumably kill me. I have personally never seen a credible instantaneous measurement of >135 bpm. I could push that hard, but I would be gasping for air, and I’m too old for that for any length of time. To average >150 bpm for 30 min is simply unimaginable. Almost every night, one of the two bpm graphs (the zone-minutes graph) shows me reaching cardio (and sometimes peak) when I am sound asleep.
I mentioned before that the Fitbit misreads arm motions as steps, but it also misreads arm motions as heartbeats. My Charge5 has repeatedly attributed cheese grating or painting as zone-minutes in the cardio or even “peak” ranges, when in reality I did not have even mildly elevated breathing.
One infuriating example of misreading heart beats is to be found in the discrepancies between the two heartbeat graphs found in the Fitbit app. One is located under the zone-minutes sub-screen; the other under the heartbeat sub-screen. Both purport to show your heartbeat rate throughout the day, and the curves are mostly similar, but the numbers do not agree. I frequently see one graph (the zone-minutes one) that is 40 bpm higher than the other. Unfortunately, the errors are not consistent; I think it depends on the frequency of the arm jiggling that seems to produce the errors. Sometimes the bumps on a washboard gravel road is just the right frequency and the heartbeat rate is error-free; at other times the reported heartbeat is up to double the actual elevation above resting bpm.
Note that all of the errors inflate the number of zone-minutes earned by a particular activity. Perhaps Fitbit finds these errors tolerable because users enjoy the flattery.
Based on my experience, I have the following recommendations to avoid erroneous heartrate measurements. If you are doing an activity regularly, exercise while observing the instantaneous heartbeat rate, and note the typical value for each part of the activity, and then ignore the daily graphs that are wildly different. Do not use the GPS tracking feature unless you really need it; use of the GPS precludes you from seeing instantaneous measurements, and every time I use the GPS I get some huge errors. Be skeptical of any measurements taken from a gravel or rough road; four-wheeling produces a lot of bogus steps and heartbeats. Wear a long-sleeved shirt over your Charge5, as it will dampen jiggles that produce bogus heartbeats. Wear your Charge5 only on your non-dominant hand (left for right-handers). If there is a discrepancy between the two graphs in the Fitbit app, defer to the lower values (usually on heartrate sub-screen).
With those caveats, the Charge5 has some useful measurements: the sleeping temperature feature is purported to be diagnostic for detecting long-covid, for example (though you need a long string of measurements prior to and after getting covid). And it you cherish a dog that loves you because you feed it, you may find solace in the Charge5’s regular messages of encouragement for each time you earn a zone-minute. If you care about the accuracy of those zone-minute measurements, you might want to consider another choice.",negative
182,Sports & Outdoors,Fitbit Charge 5,$117.96 - $240.96,4,"This is the third Fitbit I've owned. I started with a Fitbit Charge 2, then Charge 3, and now the Charge 5.

PROS: The best thing about the Fitbit Charge 5 is its display. It's the first Fitbit I've owned where the display can be read in even the brightest daylight. I don't care whatsoever that it's a color display. I'm simply happy to be able to use my watch to tell time again outdoors.

The next best thing about it (and all of the Fitbits) is the mobile app and website. I find these both to be well-designed and intuitive.

While other reviewers seem to disagree, I've found most of the basic measurements (steps, heart rate, sleep tracking, and minutes of exercise) seem to be accurate and consistent with other devices I own.

The ECG seems accurate as well. Though, here I have no other device with which to compare it.

I get about 8 days of battery life. However, this is with GPS disabled (out of privacy concerns).

All of the above reasons (and mostly the display) are why I've given it four stars.

CONS: First, the four-star rating is based on what matters most to me. A rating that includes things that matter less would drop this device to a three-star or even two-star rating.

The worst thing about this device is the lack of a physical button (or even a capacitive button) on the side of the watch. Because of this, you are limited to wrist rotation that works most of the time, swipes that often work, and taps that are often unreliable.

Allegedly, the watch is supposed to return to your chosen clock face with two rapid taps. In my experience, this works infrequently. I've literally sat there tapping the watch dozens of times without it doing so. This is far and away the most irritating thing about this watch.

Notifications on this watch are hit or (mostly) miss. About 25% of the time I get a phone call or text the watch correctly notifies me. The other 75% of the time these notifications are lost in the ether :)

The watch band that it comes with is horrible. Regrettably, the selection of replacement bands is only slightly better. I found one I can live with, but don't like. Also, the latching mechanism for the bands is far less secure than on previous versions of the Fitbit Charge. Even with the factory original band, I have some degree of difficulty getting it to latch. With at least one third-party band, it would not latch AT ALL.

When I first received this watch, the ECG feature would not work. It kept requesting I (Bluetooth) pair my device with my phone (which was already done). After an annoying call with Fitbit customer service, I was informed that I needed to wait 72 hours before the ECG would work. I don't mind the 72-hour wait. I do mind that this is not documented anywhere and that the error message says nothing about waiting.

The EDA scan gives me a number. The number may be accurate. It may not. Since there is no quantitative description of what numbers are good or bad, it seems somewhat useless to me.

The few clock faces (24) that are available are mostly terrible. They waste the limited real estate available on the face of the watch and distract with ill-chosen, poorly matching colors. Unlike the crisp, clean presentation of the website and mobile app, these clock faces seem designed by a three-year-old, with a short attention span, and a poor sense of color.

If you've come to rely on the stair counting from previous Fitbit Charge devices, this is gone. With the Charge 2, I previously like this feature. It gave a somewhat accurate count of stairs. With Charge 3, the number was so inaccurate, that it would sometimes register stairs as I walked across a flat room. I'm guessing rather than fix this bug, they decided to simply jettison the feature,

FINAL THOUGHTS: Overall, I'm comparatively happy with this watch. I desperately wish they would bring back the button on the side (or make the ECG/EDA sensors serve double duty as a capacitive button). Failing that, I hope that a future firmware update fixes the double-tapping gesture so that it actually works. I really hope that Fitbit hires a competent graphics designer for future clock faces. The current crop of faces (with one or two exceptions) is laughably bad. That, and it might be nice if they better documented the newer features (ECG/EDA) instead of leaving their users guessing.",positive
183,Sports & Outdoors,Fitbit Charge 5,$117.96 - $240.96,1,"The fitbit charge 5 is not eligible for return even if you have amazon prime(For safety reasons, items containing flammable liquids or gases can’t be returned to Amazon) so only buy this with the knowledge that you will not get your money back if anything goes wrong. If you have no plans on paying for the fitbit premium subscription then do not buy this as they are very careful not to tell you that half the features of the watch don't work without it. The health metrics dashboard is part of the subscription so without that you don't get SpO2 monitoring, heart rate variability, skin temperature variation, breathing rate during sleep or 14 out of the supposed 20 exercise routines. There is more outside of the withheld features like not being able to turn off gps(the options are dynamic, using the gps built into the watch and just your phone), location services, being auto enrolled into some social club, fitbit selling the data they collect even though it's not a free product(you MUST agree to this in order to setup the watch) and by default having the watch set to send you all sorts of emails but I guess I get upset about that more than other people these days. If you are still ok with that then I can say the watch itself is comfortable to wear. The screen is a bit slow to respond and the image is on the soft side but it's bright enough that sunshine doesn't bother me. I do have a lot of missed inputs(I can swipe 5 or so times before the watch reacts) and also it will register incorrect inputs like moving down when I swipe right. A smaller gripe is that fitbit can't seem to decide on what material the charge 5 is made from. The amazon page says it's stainless steel but the fitbit website where I originally found this on still says it's made of aluminum. The watch is lightweight though. This is about all I have to offer now. I'm stuck with a watch that won't do half of what I bought it for and in my mind amazon is beyond complacent. Until very recently amazon owned fitbit which makes it seem like this scenario was intentional. I have a product that won't work unless I pay essentially a rental fee(formerly to amazon) and I can't return the near useless product because it's now considered to be ""hazardous"" by amazon. I actually bought the charge 5 as a second chance for fitbit after directly buying a charge 4 from amazon(no third party) and RETURNING IT IMMEDIATELY as I payed for a new watch but was instead sent a used model with a screen that was scratched to heck and gunk left on the sensors from the last customer. I doubt that the charge 5 is somehow way more dangerous than the charge 4 and therefore is unsafe to take back to the warehouse. Both watches were safe enough for the warehouse to send them to me and amazon tried to scam me with the charge 4 but I was able to send that back so the way I see it now is that they just factored that into a predatory business model. I have one last thing before I forget. If you didn't know you can look around the add to cart button and under it you will find the amazon return policy. On first glance you will see that it says REFUND OR REPLACEMENT AVAILABLE but make sure you hover the mouse over it because that is not actually amazon saying that it can be returned. I honestly don't remember if I ever noticed that before but I certainly will remember from now on.",negative
184,Sports & Outdoors,Fitbit Charge 5,$117.96 - $240.96,2,"Tl;dr The Charge 5 could be great, but fitbit won't allow it and the measurements are very suspect for me.

The Charge 5 has a lot of potential, however, Fitbit has crippled the device, and the application. For starters, the sensors. The Charge 5 has both an SpO2 sensor and a body temperature sensor. However, the device doesn't make full use of them. You cannot take a real-time SpO2 reading or temperature reading. You can't even access the information in the app or online account. SpO2 is given as high and low averages which isn't helpful at all. You don't have a reference percentage so the averages really don't provide useful information. The same goes for the temp readings. The application only tells you fluctuations in your average temperature, but not what the actual reading is. To top it off, the measurements are only taken when you're asleep which is useless for fitness tracking. The ability to still actual data, and take real-time on-demand measurements would vastly improve the usefulness of the device.

Sleep tracking isn't accurate for me. It consistently records time awake as either light sleep or rem sleep. There were a few nights where I was in bed awake, TAKING AN ECG READING OR USING THE FITBIT APP and the following morning the device registered that time as being in either light sleep or deep sleep. If the device can't differentiate between being actively used and the user being asleep it makes a lot of the other sleep readings suspect. There are also times during the night when I've awoken, gotten out of bed for awhile and returned and they're not logged as time being awake. I've tried to adjust the sleep sensitivity and it makes no difference. If I am in bed reading before going to sleep the device will track the inactive period between getting into bed and falling asleep as actually being asleep. To its credit it does show it as being restless sleep, but still inaccurately recorded as being asleep.

The EDA sensor feature requires the user to pinch the sides of the Charge 5 for 3 minutes in order to take a reading. That's a really long time when you're trying to pinch something that small and hold still. By the end of every scan my fingers and/or wrist were cramped. The device must be worn while scanning so holding it comfortably in your hand isn't an option.

The mobile application is confusing to navigate. It shows metrics on a dashboard, which may be helpful for some users, but in order to find detailed information you have to dig around for it. The settings are not intuitive and there are an extremely limited amount of options for clock faces, about 24 of them. There is no real app support for the device, only the handful of fitbit branded apps that are available through the app. The fitbit SDK doesn't support the Charge series so creating your own apps or clock faces isn't an option.

There are a few 3rd party mobile applications (for Android at least, not sure about iPhone) that allow you to collect and analyze your data in much more meaningful ways, but still are not very helpful. To their credit Fitbit does allow users to download their raw data from their account, but in doing so I've noticed that a lot of data is missing. Sleep data is hit or miss, as is heart rate data. This is doing a complete archive export and viewing the json files, so the data should be there, but isn't. I can see it on the app, and in my account dashboard so it exists, but just isn't being provided.

Activity tracking isn't very accurate. I bike to work every day and most days those commutes are not tracked unless I manually tell the device that I'm about to start a biking workout. The minimum length of time that can be set for auto-tracking activities is 10 minutes with the default being 15. If I am pedaling fast, or not slowed down by traffic, my bike commute can be less than 10 minutes. But even when going for a ride in the evening that lasts an hour or more the device doesn't always track that I'm biking. When activities are not tracked it affects the daily readiness score, which looks are previous activities, combined with sleep, to calculate how ready for the day you are. Lacking actual data on activities, and suspect sleep tracking data, the readiness score is rather meaningless.

This may be an accurate device for some people, but for me it just isn't. The fact that fitbit intentionally cripples devices and makes analyzing your own data incredibly difficult suggests that maybe this isn't the best company to buy a product from if you want to be in control of what you see. That may be fine for some users. I'll be returning the Charge 5 because it doesn't meet my needs and isn't very well supported. Perhaps I'll try the Versa 3 or Sense since they are better supported, but the lack of data analyses tools is a big impediment to taking the devices seriously.",negative
185,Sports & Outdoors,Fitbit Charge 5,$117.96 - $240.96,3,"Some background info: I have been a triathlete for years. I have used Garmin devices half of my life and I track data most of the time such as running dynamics, cadence, and heart rate. I have prior history of using Fitbit watch for 2 years back around 2017-18. Now, I got the Charge 5 because I don’t want the bulkiness from the Sense because Charge 5 practically tracks the same thing as Sense (except a few things like the ABC so no stairs climbed will be measured). I tried Charge 5 for 3 days (including sleep and exercising) and one of the days I compared it side-by-side against a Garmin watch.

My quick summary: it is an excellent fitness tracking band but if you crave for something more than just basic tracking, look elsewhere.

Disclaimer: I tried it under free fitbit app because I wanted to see what I get from the free app since the membership price per year is outrageous (I am aware there is a 6-month free trial).

Here is my in-depth analysis:
Wear/appearance/design: I did like the charge 5 and its band. It is comfortable once you’ve adjusted to the correct area. I often forget I was wearing it most of the time. I have no problem wearing it overnight and no skin rash or anything after the 3rd day. I wear dress shirts during the day and it is slim and nicely hiding under my cuff. The display is vibrant and easy to read.

All-day continuous heart rate tracking: Their 24/7 PurePulse tech records your rate every 5 minutes. Garmin does it every 2 min. When I was wearing my garmin + charge 5 together for 24 hours, I can see a big deviation between both devices. The RHR for fitbit says 54-55 for me and for Garmin (from years of history tracking me) says 46-48 RHR. The HR graph is also friendlier to read on Garmin than fitbit. There is also more HR fluctuation throughout the day seen from fitbit than Garmin (perhaps because it measures every 5 min?). All in all, it is a bit questionable for me here.

EDA and ECG: I tried them but I don’t know if they are accurate. Even if they are not, it only tells me if I am sinus rhythm or not. I guess these are good features for individuals with heart concern or family hx of heart diseases.

SpO2, Heart Rate Variability, breathing rate, and skin temp: Yes fitbit tracks them, but you cannot interact with/open the graph to see how you did throughout the night/day. Garmin tracks respiration, pulse-ox, HR, and stress in real-time and I can track on the graph exactly when and what 24/7.

Steps tracking: For some reason, Fitbit is always ~250-300 steps more than Garmin at the end of the day. Not sure why but that is not a big difference. Charge 5 has no ABC so it doesn’t track floors climbed.

Sleep tracking: As mentioned above, RHR in fitbit is higher than my Garmin. It may be due to the type of sensor or other errors I’m not sure yet.

SmartTrack: I have done a 10k track workout and a 1.5 hr ride with some tempo zones 2-3. On the run, fitbit sensed it and the GPS is somewhat accurate (but it’s like spaghetti lines, not precise). HR tracking was fair compared to my garmin wrist HR. Then for cycling, the fitbit sensed it but started recording late. It also inaccurately track my HR to be much lower than my garmin heart rate chest strap that I have been using for years. Fitbit says my highest HR was 142 v.s. 166 on Garmin. I know garmin wins in this one for sure. Fitbit also doesn’t allow me to look at my exercising HR graph. If I go to another tab to see my overall HR tracking, the graph does not appear accurate at all. It is simply disappointing for cycling. I didn’t even want to bother trying it in the pool.
Free Fitbit app impression: I did my research on this prior purchasing. The only thing the Premium will get me is the 30 day trends, stress management, videos (which you can easily find online these days), and few other things I don’t care for. If you don’t care much for detailed graphs and numbers, free is enough for you. Premium is a rip-off.

Battery: it went from 100% to about 18% by the end of the 3rd day. I only sync with my phone twice a day (AM and PM). I left always-on display off. So 7-day battery life seems to be a long-stretch.

Overall: I’d give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars mainly because it does a good job tracking things but I don’t think it is there yet. I have also considered my possible bias towards it since I am comparing it with Garmin. But with my 2 years previous background with Fitbit, I do think Fitbit has improved a lot since 2017 but still need a bit more. I do think Charge 5 is great for a fitness-minded, non-competitive or non-data driven person.",fair
186,Sports & Outdoors,Fitbit Charge 5,$117.96 - $240.96,5,"Let me preface by saying that I’ve owned just about every Fitbit the company has made, dating back to at least 2013–maybe earlier—but I can’t recall.

Anyway, the Charge 5 is perfect for me. I was actually talked into buying an Apple Watch, and for about 2 weeks, my C5 stayed on my nightstand. Then I wore both for several months. Now I’m back to the C5 only. This is mainly about battery life. I can go almost a whole week without charging it, and when I do, I can plug it in while in the car and get a lot of battery in a short period of time.

This alleviates the need to remove the watch EVERY NIGHT, like the Apple Watch, and leave it on a charger at night and forget it at home when you leave in the morning. Can you tell this has happened to me—multiple times?? And if you’re like me, it’s a serious addiction to keep these fitness trackers on. So forgetting it causes a lot of anxiety.

Also, I’m not super tech savvy, so I don’t need all the bells and whistles of the Versa, the other high end FB, or the Apple Watch. I can screen my calls, read my texts, and set alarms/reminders. It’s all I need. And I wear it in the shower. I wear it in the pool. It’s been banged up too and it is still going strong. If I decide to use more features, they are there if I need them, which is nice.

Now, only time will tell because I’ve had issues in the past with quality and had to use the warranty with multiple devices. I’ve had the C5 for 6 months maybe. Maybe a year? I can’t remember. But I love that the charger is magnetic and not a clip as almost all the previous FBs are.

Overall, you won’t be disappointed, I promise!",positive
187,Sports & Outdoors,Fitbit Charge 5,$117.96 - $240.96,3,"I occasionally try Fitbit devices, even after past frustrating issues with their software ecosystem. In this case, I was looking for a device to replace my iWatch, in particular the health metric functionality. What I was looking for is a device with good battery life, without all the constant alerts and other funk the iWatch inflicts on its users.

The Charge 5 looked to fit the bill: inexpensive, provides the health data collection I wanted, had an App to present the data. One downside is the apparent need to sign up for an expensive membership, but I figured I'd give it a year and let the Fitbit ecosystem prove its value.

The trouble started almost immediately when I unboxed the device and went through the initial setup. Total PTSD, from previous attempts to use Fitbit hardware & software. Here, the device kept failing to perform the initial software update. When I hit the support boards, it was clear that many others had been bitten by this, Fitbit support saying (for 6 months plus) that their team is working the issue, and the usual voodoo medicine Rx from other users about reboot iPhone, reboot Fitbit, delete Bluetooth association, Rekki massage, crystal therapy, accupuncture, and so so. I tried various folk remedies, and after about 1.5 hours of effort got the software update on the device. The morning after, I noticed that the device wasn't presenting Spo2. Cripes! So again, off to support, and the same-old, same-old non remedies. Supposedly Spo2 won't display in some countries (go try to find out which ones), advice about getting timezone, region set properly (the devices does this automatically, so why present that as a problem resolution, Fitbit??). Here again, after some tinkering and praying to the almighty god of tech, Spo2 shows up. Who knows, but if we click out to 30k feet, I ask myself what Fitbit Product Owner, and Product Manager allows a flawed software stack and/or device like this one to ship in the first place. I was this >< close to shipping the thing back to Big Jeff at Amazon, and foreswearing Fitbit for another 5 years.

So he's the elevator pitch on this device: if you're cool with spending time debugging the stuff the software team *should* have in their test cases, by all means, go for it. The device may work eventually, just sort out the issue before the return window closes. If you expect a more ""Apple"" experience, literally run away from the Fitbit ecosystem, or less dramatically, the Charge 5. I should have done my more thorough diligence before I hit the purchase button, but Amazon has us so spoiled with returns, I regularly seem to shoot my toes off buying things that aren't ready for primetime (like Charge 5) and returning them. I hope Amazon keeps track of this sort of return and brings some pressure to bear on Fitbit.

Update: I did end up returning the Charge 5. The Charge 5 wouldn't sync to my iPhone, even when the iPhone was inches away from the Charge 5 on my wrist. I give up. I'll stick with my Apple watch. I hope this was just a bad device, but again looking at the support forums, I see many reports of sync issues. I'd rather be exercising than debugging this thing. Sorry, Fitbit, a big miss here.",fair
188,Sports & Outdoors,Fitbit Charge 5,$117.96 - $240.96,3,"I purchased this when my charge 2 died. I thought it would be a superb upgrade and I was very dissatisfied, so I called Amazon and returned it. I had no problems with the return when I explained what was happening and that I tried all the troubleshooting.
The GOOD: Nice looking, sleek design, smooth, soft band, able to see the watch face in sunlight, waterproof. The BAD: Had to beat the crap out of the screen, tried side of the screen to come on. I tried a light touch, hard touch, it just sucked. It just took so much effort. Flicking my wrist seemed to be the only way it came on every time on cue, I saw tendonitis in my future from the constant flicking. I missed pushing a button and seeing the time. I did try the manual and auto, they both sucked. I could not imagine putting a screen protector on it, as the screen just didn’t respond for me without one. I read that people with protectors said their charger didn’t work. Not sure that’s true, but I thought I’d throw that in for you to research. I also did not like any of the watch faces. They all looked so abstract and crazy. I just wanted big black and white lettering, and not an art showcase. I will say the screen in the light is way better to see then the Charge 2, that I loved. There is no way to arrange what order comes up on your screen like on the Charge 2. So, I must swipe through notifications, which I don’t use to finally get to my exercise. The treadmill did not log for me, but it would in run mode on a treadmill. Amazon rep said it doesn’t log treadmill runs. Not sure its true, but there is an exercise listed for treadmill. I also didn’t see aerobics as an option, just workout. I can’t see well without my glasses, and I don’t run in my glasses. With my Charge 2, I just started my run and at the end, held the side button to feel the vibration to let me know I ended the run. The Charge 5, you must tap the screen to start, then pause, then done and then finish. What??? Three steps to end my run when I can’t see the screen. The OEM band was nice and smooth, but I could not get the right tension. I have a small wrist and on one hole I was too tight and the other too loose, so I didn’t feel it was super comfortable. I was hoping it may stretch because the band is smooth and soft. I wish someone made that soft, smooth band material for the Charge 2 but with the buckle. I like the smooth, non-buckle band but it just didn’t fit me. Also, none of your bands, screen savers or chargers from the 2, will transition to the Charge 5. I did the 6-month free premium trial and none of the extra sleep, heart and Oxygen sensor would work. It also would not log my sleep from day one. It doesn’t count stairs anymore, but I didn’t use that much anyway, but I know people who do. In the run it buzzes you when you’re in-cardio mode and in fat burning mode, but never lets you know when your out of it. I didn’t find it useful. Plus, by the time I looked at the screen it shut off even though I had the screen display set to long time. I just felt for a brand-new tracker, it should not have had so many problems out of the gate, even trying all the troubleshooting, reading blogs from similar people who had the same problems. I looked at getting the Charge 4, most people said the Spotify was worthless. I guess if you want the 4 or the 5, it would be for the GPS and payment feature, which didn’t hit any of my needs. I have my phone on an armband and listen to music from my phone, so the GPS worked on my Charge 2 fine. I am sure there are killer features for runners on the new Fitbit. But I just wanted a simple tracker for exercise, steps, stopwatch, and time. I just think that it wasn’t that great for what my needs were. I bought a new Charge 2 on eBay. If I could not have found a new Charge 2, I still would have returned the Charge 5 and bought another brand. There were just too many annoyances for me to deal with on something I wear 24/7.",fair
189,Sports & Outdoors,Fitbit Charge 5,$117.96 - $240.96,3,"Had to replace a FitBit Charge 3 (FB3) and FitBit Charge 5 (FB5) was $80 cheaper, so went with that figuring that improvements would be the majority of what I experienced. . . . surprise!!

GOOD:
- the time needed to update and sync between FB5 and app is almost instantaneous when the app is opened and is a great change - no more, ""hold, this is taking longer than expected"" and sometimes having to restart the process on the FB3

- sleep tracking is much more consistent and in-depth with scores immediately available; it's even smart enough to know when you have taken a nap

- the addition of an EKG like monitor is a nice function although I'm not sure how accurate it is

NOT SO GOOD: it feels like there's super annoying and judgmental life coach and salesman packed in there

- Alarm function: the FB3 snooze feature was simple: swipe to snooze and catch a few more minutes; with FB5: the ""tap"" feature to view the screen to access snooze or turn off features appears to be programmed to require a much stronger ""tap"" (aka ""you asked me to wake you up - I'm going to make you work for it!"").

Once you get to snooze and choose it, the alarm/vibrate function continues on for another 2-3 seconds prompting a gut check/stress moment of ""uh-oh, did I not touch the right button or did I actually set the snooze?"" (thanks for the use of stress and concern to help ""make sure"" that I get up at the time I asked for, Coach!"") and the ""sweet spot"" and strength of tap required to access the snooze/shut off feature after consecutive choices to snooze become more finite and you might feel like you have to punch it to be able to turn the alarm off

select ""turn off alarm"" and, of course, the alarm instantly stops (""Good job being responsible and getting up like we agreed! You won't have to work to rest a little longer!"")

- Being uber connected has it's ups and downs - including security and privacy concerns. The Salesman in my FB5 somehow seems to have randomly programmed the system to buzz my wrist and make me look at a reminder on my screen that I should enter my credit card information so that I can use my FB5 at swipe or tap and pay retailers; I chose not to give you that information when I set the app and device up, I don't need to be hounded about more ways to move money out of my wallet!

- Be sure the charger is fully attached! The FB3 had a charging cord with a plastic ""dock"" that you knew it was locked in and working because of the click and the change on screen to show that it was charging. The FB5 has a magnet based charging interface about the size of the back of the FB5 and there is a right way (look to align the gold dots on the FB5 with the interface) and lots of opportunity to not get it right. The magnet isn't designed to ""lock"" the FB5 in place for charging. Charging happens via the back of the FB, which is surrounded by wristband - depending on style creating a risk of setting it down to charge and having the wristband press against the cord and dislodge the charger.

- FB5 uses battery power more quickly than the FB3. I could easily go about a week between FB3 charges. The FB5 has a max of 4-5 days and takes much longer to recharge - to the tune of hours vs. 45 minutes to an hour starting from about 20% remaining charge.

- ""water lock"" sounds like a good feature to have. If you're thinking it's an extra layer of protection for your FB, it isn't! Water lock is simply designed to change the sensitivity of the FB face and reduce it so that as you take a shower, the water beads don't inadvertently ""tap"" the screen and access the FB interactivity and do something you don't want. Oh the irony of the sensitivity to water and the strength required to wake up!!

- Introducing the FitBit Commander Fashionista! Color choices for the FB5 wristband: whatever the source store decides! I had no other apparent choice than the ""Lunar White"" which was enough for a couple people to ask, ""What are you wearing?"" Score one for the Salesman in there! Another $13.99 spent to move away from forced color ""choices"". Unlike the FB3, there does appear to be many more materials, styles, and color choices for other wristbands if you don't get what you like.",fair
190,Sports & Outdoors,Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel,$21.58 - $42.93,4,"I’ve had this bottle for around 4-5 months. I’ve always wanted a water bottle with this design and I held off from buying it because of some negative reviews. I would like to address the cons and pros.

CONS :

> Yes, the spring mechanism and what holds the top down does feel like and look like cheap plastic. If you hold down the button for it to open the top, it will spring back quickly and hit the holder.

It has broken on people this way. All I do is make sure my finger is behind the top to catch it as it springs open. No issues there so far.

> ”My water bottle is dented”
Uh, yeah. It happens. I hate it when it does, but it’s a malleable metal bottle (aluminum). I slipped the other day in the rain, had this is my (very lightweight) small sling backpack and heard the loud thud of metal. Thought it was ruined, but it wasn’t! Hardly noticed a dent and doesn’t affect the bottle from standing and does not wobble. No one will notice by holding it or looking at it unless closely inspecting.

> I actually had someone irl tell me how she bought two for her kids, and they both leaked. I have personally overfilled this bottle, left it on its side like all time, and have never experienced leakage. I imagine her kids may not be careful and they store it in their backpacks.. listen anybody going to school and has a backpack for the most part will throw it around, place it carelessly/roughly on the ground, or have items that might push up against the release button and cause it to open. I have never had this issue.

> Doesn’t cool well tbh. I’ve had water bottles better at maintain a cool temperature like Manna. If you fill it with ice and not as much water it’s icy, but not for long and doesn’t cool quickly.

PROS:

> We all bought it for a reason!! This has to be more of a common thing and needs better marketing. When I look up water bottle this should be the first one to pop up. It took me way too long actively searching for one, not knowing if it existed.

It’s soooo convenient and well made. Mostly use the straw, and use the gulp when I have lipgloss on. I love that the straw is concealed, and won’t spill because of the secured top. Not to mention the ease of carrying with the handle. The handle could be better, not awful though.

> Wide variety, easy to find a color scheme that someone will like.

Things to consider:

>If you don’t like dents, get a rubberized based or sleeve. Or slap a bunch of stickers on the dents if you already have them.

>The 30 oz bottle is too big for most car bottle holders. I wish I would’ve gotten the slimmer size, but I drink a lot of water so it’s a trade off.

> If you carry this is in a backpack, make sure the bottle is standing upright and not overfilled. If you can’t guarantee that, then hold it/store it on the side.

> Handle isn’t comfortable for handling and especially not for big hands. I’m tall, but don’t have large hands and I never carry it from the handle because it’s uncomfortable. Instead I have keys/apt pass on my lanyard. So, I snake it through the handle and use the lanyard as a strap and carry it like “a purse”, if you can visualize what I mean.

Overall:

They could tweak the current product to make it better. Make it able to retain temperature better, better materials for the top portion, and different handle design. I would still buy again, probably in a slimmer size.",positive
191,Sports & Outdoors,Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel,$21.58 - $42.93,5,"Solves multiple problems I've found in other water bottles.

It's 100% leakproof so far after weeks of rigorous daily use.

I put ice in it and there is still ice left after coming home from long, hot summer days out, and there is no sweating from the bottle except the cap but only very little.

I like having a straw but bottles with straws are notoriously hard to clean. This one doesn't have any complicated air vents or bendy points for mold or bacteria to get trapped in. It's easy to reach every part of the cap/straw with a simple straw brush. Only complaint is that my straw doesn't fit snugly into the hole so it falls out easily. I've found a solution to that but hopefully this is just a flaw in mine and not all of them. I'm planning to contact the company for a replacement straw. (Will update with reviews about customer service)

Other strawed bottles also tend to squirt water out through the straw if it's a hot day because of the expansion of air as it heats up inside. Kind of unavoidable in other designs but this one doesn't have a tight seal around the straw so this doesn't happen.

The straw feature feels totally natural as if you're drinking from a normal straw, as well as the wide mouth for drinking from it as a strawless water bottle.

If you're tucking it into your purse, hanging it from a backpack with a clip, putting it into a standard cup holder, the large one may be a little too big. It does last all day between me and 2 little kids, though. I may get a small one for shorter or cooler days so I don't have to carry the huge one around.

No complaints so far!!",positive
192,Sports & Outdoors,Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel,$21.58 - $42.93,5,"I was really expecting to get a mediocre bottle that was going to hold me over until I got a replacement lid for my Thermos. But I was actually really surprised by what I got, and how well it's worked so far for me.

One thing that I had worried about is that it looked like a chonk, and it definitely is in the hand; why so many bottle makers keep insisting on not making them just a little taller to skinny them down, I don't know. But I know when I got this bottle, even though some reviews claimed it fit in their car cup holder, I had my doubts. Imagine my surprise when my 2017 Corolla cup holders actually allowed it to fit... Mostly. Just like my Thermos, there's at least half an inch of space beneath it; it doesn't fit all the way down. I guess the cup holder itself narrows down for some reason, but this bottle still fits in enough to keep it from tipping.

The dual straw/spout thing seemed like a gimmick, but it's actually been one of the best things about this. I figured I would barely use the straw, but that's all I've really been using. No more small ice chips in my face, though it does take a little mindfulness to not forget and tip it too far. The pop button works well, and even though I use soda in it in flagrant ignorance of the warnings, I've no issues as I can just use a finger to keep it from snapping open. The latch is nice, and does double duty as a handle, though I can't help but imagine it will be a weak point.

The wide mouth is very appreciated to dump in ice easily. I'm not as keen on the colors - I really would have liked a nice red in the 24 oz sizes - but the purple is okay, and it's definitely a grapey purple. And it has kept my drinks surprisingly cold, even overnight. I even left some ice cubes in it after I had drank the liquid, and outside in my car overnight in 40 or so degree temps, I picked it up the next day to hear the ice still rattling around.

Have not had any leaks yet, though I'm not exactly tossing it around. However, tipping it upside down and letting it sit on its side for a few hours gave me no grief.

So far, I'm impressed with this company I've never seen before. Would definitely like more colors though.

EDIT, 6/22: So, I've noticed that after about fifty degrees outside, the bottle will still pretty much keep things cold, but the ice will melt if I leave the bottle in my car. So it still mostly works well, but I'm hesitant to trust it during our current heat wave.",positive
193,Sports & Outdoors,Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel,$21.58 - $42.93,4,"First, I do really like the water bottle which is why I have been waiting for a sale/clearance so I could buy one. It does not leak, so far. There are a few small crevices, like the straw spout, that make cleaning a bit more detailed if you do not want an accumulation of gunk. The bottle does not keep ice from melting, but it does keep water cold, even when in the car all day so don’t skimp on the ice if you are on the move. It’s very convenient to have the flip top with an option to sip out of a straw, especially when driving.

My only reason for not giving this water bottle all five stars is I bought it at a big discount during Amazon Prime days. I did not open the package right away because I wanted to keep it boxed until I was ready to use it. Once I opened it, after the 30-day return window had closed, I discovered the bottom of the bottle has a dent in it. Bottom line, buy the water bottle, but don’t buy a discounted one that probably did not pass QC, or open your package right away.",positive
194,Sports & Outdoors,Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel,$21.58 - $42.93,5,"I saw this on Facebook, and was intrigued. So I bought a plastic one to start in case I didn’t like it (the plastic ones are cheaper). But I love it so much! So I bought a stainless steel one. Owala has a few different designs. The one I bought is the FreeSip. This attracted me for one reason. I love drinking with a straw, but sometimes when I take my daily pills, I can’t get enough water through a straw to get my pills down. Owala FreeSip fixes that! I can turn the bottle up and guzzle to take my pills, and then go right back to sipping with the straw. There’s nothing I don’t like about it. It’s leakproof (some bottles claim to be, but aren’t; this one really is). The flip top lid is easy to open one handed. The bottle shape (at least the 24 oz.) is easy to hold. It keeps drinks cold for 24 hours. Two complaints that another reviewer had was you can’t put stickers on it (you totally can; you just need waterproof stickers), and they wish it came with a boot to make it not so noisy. They recently started selling boots that you can put on your bottle. So absolutely no complaints (if I had one, it be would be that the color combos are a little weird. But I’ve found a couple that I like). Like my title says, best water bottle ever!",positive
195,Sports & Outdoors,Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel,$21.58 - $42.93,5,"Once you try the freesip technology you won't want to return to they other stainless bottles you probably already have. That's what happened to us. We now own 6 of these bottles because they can all be customized by switching the colorful lids. They have become a hot item at my daughter's school. We normally aren't the type to jump on the trend wagon, but these bottles merit all the hype. Try one and you'll see why. The entire family has their own bottle and we have started giving them as gifts. Everyone loves them and I think you will too.",positive
196,Sports & Outdoors,Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel,$21.58 - $42.93,5,"Over the years, I have wasted so much money on other water bottles that just lack a feature or two that is important to me. I want my bottle to have the opening covered, yet be easy to open. I want it to be leak proof. I want it to be easy to drink from. this bottle does it all!

I usually find that bottles with a straw give so little water for the effort. But, because there is a big opening for sipping, I can get a big gulp for the effort. If I want a bigger drink, there is the large, handy spout. And everything stays clean and covered when not in use.

It definitely is leak proof, too. I like the fact that the carry handle slips over the release button, providing security when storing a full bottle.

I never expected it to hold the ice water so well, either. Usually, when I put ice water in other bottles, there is always sweating on the outside. But not with this bottle! The first time I used it was on an overnight trip. I filled it with ice water when we left home, and even 15 hours later, the water was still cold, even though I had added extra water on the way.

The only negatives I have are that it is a little heavy when filled, and it does not fit in the car cup holders.",positive

So, less waste; less work toting water from store into house and then cans to recycle; less cost - has already paid for itself. I also just like the feel of the bottle in my hand.

199,Sports & Outdoors,Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel,$21.58 - $42.93,5,Distraught and cap on this water bottle are the best. The straw is not a circular design where you drink from so it really fits your lips and you don’t have to pucker to drink from the straw.

230,Sports & Outdoors,"Fit Simplify Resistance Loop Exercise Bands with Instruction Guide and Carry Bag, Set of 5",$12.95,5,"I sit and read too much. I have bought the mixed bands several times. They do biodegrade and you should not leave them laying on top of each other because they will fuse together. Yeah, that is why I have bought several times. The yellow seems to be easiest for my shoulder injury. I am working on forearms, biceps and triceps. Since the yellow was best, I bought the multi yellow package and have mounted them on ropes behind my chair for triceps and D rings I have fastened to the wooden frame on the front of my chair arms for biceps and forearms.

The green one is for finger exercises. It works GREAT! All other finger exercisers I have tried were too weak or too hard. I can adjust these by moving my arm further back or forward. I do finger curls and finger lifts.

Black is for abductors and adductors on legs! I had to buy a new package for an extra black and green. The long green band on back of chair is too weak so I will look for a stronger long band for abdominal exercises in my chair and maybe working my neck. I wrap it in front of my chest (both sides) and push forward against. And most of my exercises I can READ AND WORKOUT! Yas!",positive
231,Sports & Outdoors,"Fit Simplify Resistance Loop Exercise Bands with Instruction Guide and Carry Bag, Set of 5",$12.95,4,"This is a good solid set of exercise bands. When ordering, be sure you are aware of the size before ordering.
I found the bands a bit shorter than expected. They have been very useful for arm exercises but as I am tall, I don't think they will work as well for leg exercises. Also, you should be careful using the yellow bands. They are very thin and Mine broke after only two weeks of use. Not a problem if you are able to move up to the next level. So far, no problems from there on.

240,Sports & Outdoors,Thermoflask Bottle with Chug and Straw Lid,$19.99 - $58.99,5,"First of all check other end for other lid upon receiving. This lid, the one that has a little cap that screws down is the only one I like. I don't like the large rectangular straw extension in my mouth, plus even though it's HUGE, the underside is teeny and my pulverized fruit and Chia seeds clog it. So why did I give it 5 stars you ask? 1. Lid 2 with the little screw on cap is great for using a straw or sipping directly from it,a long wide straw from Wendy's or Quick Trip works wonderfully, and there's still room to screw on the lid with the straw inside if you don't feel like finishing it right then. 2. Ice cubes will still be in it 24 hours later. 3. Your smoothie with frozen fruit and pulverized ice cubes will stay frozen for at the very least 5 hours, very cold much, much longer. 4. Easy to clean 5. Fits in my car's cup holder 6.The only one besides Thermos flask 24 hrs(no longer can find them) that keeps ice 24 hours and keeps my smoothies FROZEN!!!

It has served me well so far and I'm very pleased. The color was a little darker than pictured in the advertisement, more of a dark blue and less if a dark teal, but I like it... and as long as you're ok with maybe a little surprise in slight color variation (if that's true for all the colors), I recommend.

The only weak part is the straw. Over time it stretches and comes loose when the cap is opened. But they give you an extra. Even when the second straw wears out you can get tubing same size.

Got back home and still lots of ice inside. So I poured in more soda.

As far as fitting in the car’s cup holder, it does, but only about the bottom 3/4”; enough to be fairly secure, but doesn’t sit flat in the holder. It lays on the car seat without leaking, so it’s all good. Unable to get a straw brush through it to clean thoroughly, but only intend to use it for water anyway. I read other reviews that said the straw sucks too much air, which mine did, too, until I realized the straw needs to be more than fully open- almost hyper-extended; no problem with it now.

Keeps your beverage cold (i.e. you will still have ice in the bottle a day later - yes, you read correctly)
Different lid options (well, everyone has a favorite)
Great size

247,Sports & Outdoors,Thermoflask Bottle with Chug and Straw Lid,$19.99 - $58.99,5,I really like this thermoflask! My favorite part is the straw so you don’t have to tip it to drink water. It was larger than I expected so it’s hard to hold with my small hands but that’s fixed by the loop on the top of the lid that you can carry it by. It is also too big for a regular cup holder but it doesn’t leak so it’s not that bad to put it on a car seat or something like that. I love how much water it holds. Hydration for days 💪,positive

Easy to grip, comfortable to hold onto, and they weighed in at exactly 6 lbs.

There *is* a thicker ridge of neoprene running down one side of each, but I think that's typical. I don't like how it feels in my palm, so I just rotate the weights until that part is at the end of my fingers. Another reviewer said metal protruded through the neoprene and cut them...no sharpness on mine, but there are a few ""bubbles"" in the coating. I pressed on them to make sure it wasn't sharp underneath and I can't FEEL anything, but time will tell if the coating wears thin in those spots. Overall, I think this is a great set of weights! I've looked everywhere for a set of 6 lb dumbbells with neoprene, and it was a serious struggle in stores.
