0,Entertainment Collectibles,Walk On: 15-Minute Fast Fat Blasts DVD with Jessica Smith,$16.97,4,"Already was a big fan of Jessica and her team members- Debbie and Beth. As usual, this DVD did not disappoint.

Includes 4, 15 minute walks, each quite different from the other ones. Fast and fun.

Each one also includes a cooldown which can be skipped if doing more than one walk per session.

The time really flies on these, even better than previous ones in her collection that I also enjoy.

Some jogging intervals included throughout which I really appreciate to keep up the tempo. Some new moves too. No floor work or equipment required.

Excellent musical choices too, very motivating.

Only negatives, the white flooring, deck is a bit ""dazzling"" at times, that could be better. This is one area where these DVDs overall could be improved. A consultant for backgrounds that would enhance not detract from the actual routines would be a worthwhile investment. They often seem like an afterthought.

I also wish Jessica was a bit more encouraging to her mom, Debbie. Always commenting on the other participant, Beth and how great she is doing. Well so is mom!! It seems like there is some tension going on between mom and daughter. I think it's wonderful that her mom IS on these DVDs so it would be nice to see a bit more encouragement and kind words directed towards her too.

Overall, enjoying this DVD and will be using it on a regular basis.üòä

1,Entertainment Collectibles,Walk On: 15-Minute Fast Fat Blasts DVD with Jessica Smith,$16.97,5,"I love Jessica Smith's workouts. They are perfect for my fitness level - 40's and trying to lose that annoying 10 pounds but can't do high-intensity/impact workouts anymore. I really love how flexible these workouts are - so easy to just do one or two after dinner or before brekfast in the morning. I usually do at least an hour each day with Jessica and I have found that my weight loss is going better - it turns out, that I needed MORE calorie burn than the usual 30 minutes because excess weight is really hard to get off at this age.
These workouts are broken into four 15 minute segments (each workout is about 1 mile). You can use these workouts as add-ons or do them altogether which is what I did for the first time. I will probably mostly use them as add-ons though.
First Segment: Fast Fat Burn - challenging and fast paced with lots of fun moves
Second Segment: Belly Blaster- focuses on the core with typical moves like knee lifts
Third Segment: Power Pick Up - designed as an energy booster walk to help provide energy when you are tired
Fourth Segment: Dance Party - super-fun dance moves with cha-cha's, grapevines etc.
I honestly like all of these segments and they went by surprisingly fast but my favorite is the dance party (of course!). I love these types of workouts because it doesn't feel like you're working out. Overall, another winner to add to my growing Jessica Smith Collection.

To Share: Just a few tips that I have learned along the way...
1. If possible, workout in the morning...it feels great to start your day off right and helps to set you up for success the rest of the day
2. Get enough sleep. Turn off that TV before bed! My favorite app is CALM and I seriously love the meditations and the sleep stories.
3. Eat as many veggies as you can and pay close attention to carbs/sugar. Too many carbs (sugar) impede weight loss. You CAN eat carbs and you SHOULD but...it's a small portion (example per day serving: 2 pieces of whole grain toast, 1/2 cup oatmeal, 1/2 cup brown rice, 1/2 cup if ice cream etc...)
4. Forgive yourself! Mistakes happen! The ""Oops, we all went out and had pizza and wine and chocolate cake..."" moment is going to happen. You're human and you're not perfect so aim for progress, not perfection. Just get right back to it the next day...and maybe walk an extra mile or use one of these 15 minute segments to get back on track!
5. Be Prepared. Have healthy snacks available and have at least a handful of healthy go-to recipes on hand that are super-easy to make. This way...you'll be able to say no to unhealthy eating.
6. Keep your eye on the prize. Maybe it's a new pair of skinny jeans or a new dress in a smaller size or better yet...think of all the energy you'll have when you've stuck with a workout plan (Jessica has workout challenges all the time and they are so fun to do!) I'm doing Jessica's 28 day challenge right now and I've only missed one day...sorry Peanut! Isn't he the cutest??!!
To wrap up: anything Jessica Smith is great, energizing, fun, and most of all - it works! I simply love working out now and that is not something I ever said in the past. I always dreaded my workouts becasue they were so hard and exhausting (even in my younger days). Since I found Jessica, I actually can say I look forward to doing my workouts - they're fun and invigorating and they make me feel great. This DVD is no exception.",positive
2,Entertainment Collectibles,Walk On: 15-Minute Fast Fat Blasts DVD with Jessica Smith,$16.97,3,"This DVD may frustrate you if it‚Äôs your introduction to Jessica‚Äôs workouts. If you are a beginner, please get Jessica‚Äôs DVD ‚ÄúTen-Minute Quick Walk Mix‚Äù instead. I love it and do it in my office throughout the day, to get out of the chair periodically. This one, well‚Ä¶

Choreography and choice of exercises: Excellent! Lots of variety and the transitions are smooth.

Pace and tempo: Great.

Music and sound quality: Bad. The electronic classical music segments in the first and third workouts are, in my opinion, jarring. I‚Äôm not a purist complaining that Beethoven must be turning in his grave, but rather an exerciser who thinks that it sounded terrible. In the third workout it‚Äôs even coupled with a sudden jazz segment. Please, don‚Äôt ever work again with the person who picked the music. It‚Äôs also set too loud, which is wrong. The instructor should not have to shout to be heard. The music should be at a lower volume. Jessica is not wearing a microphone in this one, and the result looks amateurish. There‚Äôs a lot of hand-clapping in the fourth workout, which echoes terribly in the high-ceiling room. Seriously, no one did a sound test before approving the location?

Setting: Not a good choice. A mansion with everything painted white, inside and out. Not a good visual and can be blinding to the eyes. The first workout is outdoors (as is the third one), and about 6 minutes in, you can clearly hear a police siren next door. Debbie has to be on the alert constantly not to trip on the steps leading to the pool. Bad, bad, bad location choice.

Timer on the screen: There isn‚Äôt one, which disappointed me, after having a timer in her other DVDs I own. The timer is useful for those of us with the whiny, exercise-insecure ‚Äúare we there yet‚Äù internal voice.

Jessica herself: She‚Äôs always wonderful, but here, uncharacteristically, she seems to be afflicted with Leslie Sansoneitis (a diagnosis of constant chatter). She looks great as usual, with beautiful outfits and flawless makeup, but I wouldn‚Äôt record a DVD for commercial release without getting my hair done first. She also channels Denise Austin‚Äôs oft-repeated reinterpretation of the English language (‚Äúone vertebrae at a time!‚Äù ‚Äì um, this is no more possible than ‚Äúone crunches at a time‚Äù).

If you are looking for short, fun, low-impact workouts that you do standing up, then in my opinion, Jessica‚Äôs best DVDs are ‚ÄúTen-Minute Quick Walk Mix‚Äù and ‚ÄúFive Mix and Match Miles‚Äù, both of which she does inside a studio, with professional music and sound quality and a countdown timer on the screen. They are awesome and I use them frequently.

This DVD is a good workout because it has a wide variety of exercise moves (much wider than in the DVDs I named). Just keep in mind the shortcomings that I listed above. The third workout is definitely the dud in the group (boring moves and bad music). The overall ‚Äúneon and dance party‚Äù atmosphere can be great fun, but the technical execution here spells ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù and ‚Äúamateur‚Äù.

Please, Jessica, take the wonderful choreography, neon clothing, Debbie, and Beth, and re-record these workouts with them inside the studio you used for the Raquel DVDs, and with better music.",fair
3,Entertainment Collectibles,Walk On: 15-Minute Fast Fat Blasts DVD with Jessica Smith,$16.97,5,"I'm new to Jessica's workouts, but I loved these so much that I immediately ordered her Walk On: 21 Day Weight Loss Plan DVD (which I'm starting on this week). I think Leslie Sansone's great, but after years of doing her workouts, some of them can be a bit boring and repetitive, so I wanted a new ""brand"" of walking.

But first a bit about me: I'm 48 years old and can have very painful knee joints and suffer chronic lower back pain. I used to be a rigorous, avid exerciser but am just getting back into fitness and exercising daily after a long hiatus. I stay mobile, and you'd never guess I have such bad back pain to look at me, I just have to choose my workouts wisely.

These 4 workouts have great variety and pack a lot into 15 minutes so that you feel you've had a good workout even when you're pressed for time or low on motivation. THERE'S NO DREAD FACTOR WITH THESE WORKOUTS, and that's a huge plus in my book! I mean, nobody wants to dread their workouts, right? We're way more inclined to actually EXERCISE when we don't have to talk ourselves into putting on workout gear & loading the DVD.

Jessica, her mom, and her friend demonstrate different levels of intensity, and you feel you're getting a solid workout with all of the options. The production quality is great, and the instructor is encouraging, fun, and talkative without being annoying or just too much to take. Her cuing is practically flawless. She also adds variety and interest to ""walks"" that I didn't even think were possible after doing Leslie Sansone for so long (and don't get me wrong - I love Leslie!) You don't have to be coordinated or graceful to do these workouts effectively (because I'm neither!).

You could easily just do one of these for a nice workout or combine two or more for a bit more of a challenge, depending on the time and/or motivation you may have on any given day. These are terrific for any age and they're easy on the joints.

Buy without hesitation or fear, and HAVE FUN! I have many workout DVDs, and this one is now in heavy rotation!",positive
4,Entertainment Collectibles,Walk On: 15-Minute Fast Fat Blasts DVD with Jessica Smith,$16.97,4,"Good short workouts. I wanted an alternative to Leslie Sansone. I really like Jessica's voice and comments throughout this DVD; not too much; not too little. Other workout DVD instructors can get a bit annoying with the constant chatter and sometimes forced banter between her and the other group of walkers. :D
so, I do really like that Jessica only has two other walkers with her in the video and she is the only one doing the talking. I also like that each exerciser in the video does a different intensity of workout. so, if you want low impact, you follow Jessica's Mother's moves in the video. If you are game for a higher intensity workout, you follow Beth. I do agree with other reviewers that some of the moves were a little complicated. but, on the other hand, I was looking for something different on the exercise moves than what I had been doing with other videos. So, that's okay. If I cannot do a move, I simply keep walking. Jessica uses a lot more arm movements with each walk step than I am used to on other videos. One thing I do like about Leslie Sansone is that she always counts down to the next move an announces what that next exercise move will be. Jessica doesn't. she just goes into the next step. I found that a little frustrating. I also didn't really work up a sweat with this video. I'm going to see if Jessica has another video where you exercise for one mile, two miles, etc. to see if they are comparable to what I have been doing with other videos. all in all though, I really like the variety in moves and I will definitely try out some of Jessica's other videos.",positive
5,Entertainment Collectibles,Walk On: 15-Minute Fast Fat Blasts DVD with Jessica Smith,$16.97,5,"As a big fan of Jessica I'm so happy she's come out with these short workouts which pack a punch in a small amount of time! They're perfect for add-ons: I usually do one or two in addition to either one of her YouTube videos or other DVDs. The time flies and her enthusiasm and cheery spirit are infectious. I'm happy that first segment, Fast Fat Burn, is basically a toned down version of HIIT. I know that HIIT has a lot of pros to it but I absolutely hate doing HIIT routines - with Fast Fat Burn I at least feel I'm get a bit of HITT's benefits without a lot of strain and no ""dread factor."" While I love her 21 day weight loss DVD set I've only done the HIIT portion once so with the Fast Fat Burn I don't feel as guilty. Belly Blaster is very targeted and great for days when you're too spent for an entire cardio core workout. Power Pick Up may be the gentlest of the 4 but Jessica as usual is sneaky and it packs a bigger punch than you'd think. My personal favorite is Dance Party, which is exactly as it sounds. Jessica says it's all about fun (it is) but it's also an effective workout. Although none of these are very intense I did work up a sweat and think they'd be a wonderful introduction for beginners or others who have taken a rest from exercise and want to start again (such as myself). Jessica's mom, Debbie, demonstrates the basics with no difficult moves while her friend Beth is there for higher impact modifications that would suit those at an intermediate level. All and all delightful little routines. I hope Jessica comes out with more of these shorter workouts because you can mix and match on days when you have more energy, add one onto another workout, or do one or two on days when you just don't feel like exercising. Highly recommend!",positive
6,Entertainment Collectibles,Walk On: 15-Minute Fast Fat Blasts DVD with Jessica Smith,$16.97,5,"I am an avid fan of Jessica's workout DVDs. I eagerly purchased this when it became available. This is an excellent DVD, with four 15-minute routines, designed to be used alone, as quick, efficient workout routines, or in addition to other routines. Alternatively, all four can be combined for an efficient, effective hour long workout.

The DVD includes four, 15-minute standing routines that require minimal space, NO equipment and are EXCELLENT for traveling. The routines are shot outdoors in Florida. A great pick me up considering my 20 below temperatures in the Midwest!!! These routines are designed for all fitness levels, and include beginner (Jessica's lovely Mom Debbie), intermediate (Jessica) and advanced (Beth). The workouts each have a different ""focus"" with workout 1 (Fast Fat Burn) being an efficient, standing cardio routine, with walk/jog intervals. Workout 2 (Belly Blaster) is a standing ab routine with twists and high knee marches among others, designed to work the abdominals without having to lay on the floor, and in a 360-degree fashion. Workout 3 (Power Pick Up) is a great routine to do first thing in the morning, or if you just don't feel like working out, but don't let the name fool you, while it's the gentlest of the routines, it still gets the job done. Workout 4 (Dance Party) is a fun, dance-inspired walk that features moves such as the grape vine, step and clap, and lasso-arms (really fun).

Versus some of Jessica's other walking DVDs, there are new moves and variation with these routines. Like I mentioned, I feel they are great additions to other routines, or if you just need a quick ""pick me up"". Because of modifiers, these are designed for all levels. While not as intense as some of Jessica's other DVDs (Cardio Abs etc), effort and intensity level adds variation and increases calorie burn.

For reference, I am a more intermediate to advanced exerciser, and ~140 lbs, 5'7. (female, thirties). On average, I burned 150-175 calories per 15 minute routine using a mix of intermediate to advanced options throughout the routines.

I feel this DVD is an excellent addition to my fitness collection, and one I fully intend on using regularly in addition to my other programs.",positive
7,Entertainment Collectibles,Walk On: 15-Minute Fast Fat Blasts DVD with Jessica Smith,$16.97,5,"I love Jessica Smith, and I love these ""Walk on"" DVDS. These are perfect for those with any type of injury that doesn't allow them to get on the floor or jump around like a crazy person. No floor work makes this even better. Especially for those with poor core and arm strength, floor workouts are insanity, same with those that have injuries. These are challenging, yet doable and fun which makes you want to try harder. These are perfect to play all together for a long walk, or if you want to add on some time to your workout, need something easier to rest your body, or just want a quick pick me up. So many options with these, and her whole workout team has easier and harder levels for you to follow. You can make this as hard as you want. I love being a part of the #JSTVfit team! Now for calorie burn. I am giving an average here. If you're heavier, you'll burn more, thinner less calories etc etc. This is a range. I have a polar FT7, female, very early 30s, (5'7 height and currently 168) and on average for these DVDs I burn about 150-200 calories per 15 walk. (Today for instance did the ""Belly Blaster"" DVD and burned 178 calories. Or another time did ""Fast Fat Burn"" and ""Dance Party"" and burned 348 calories, so 174 calories individually.) I love the endless possibilities with these. Also own ""Walk On: 21 day weight loss plan"" and love that too!!!! Jessica is a great instructor, perfect mix of direction, humor and happiness. She may start off slow to warm you up, but she packs a punch that anyone can do. That is what I loveeee about these DVDs! It makes you want to try, and not get so frustrated that you want to give up. This is what everyone needs, especially beginners.",positive
8,Entertainment Collectibles,Walk On: 15-Minute Fast Fat Blasts DVD with Jessica Smith,$16.97,5,"I am on a Jessica Smith kick, having started with her YouTube videos. I was using these videos as my second workout of the day after sitting at a computer for many hours.
I am happy to support Jessica since she is so generous in providing so many free YouTube videos.

This and the  Walk On: 21 Day Weight Loss Plan  are my two new favorites. I was very skeptical about 15 minute workouts, but now I'm hooked. I use these workouts as an add-on to other workouts, or as a quick pick-me-up during the day.

This DVD has:
* FAST FAT BURN: Moves include front and side steps, jacks, jogging, and hamstring curls.
* BELLY BLASTER: It's all standing ab work-with moves like standing crunches, torso twists, side steps standing crunches and v steps.
* POWER PICKUP: Moves like fast walking, other walking patterns, knee ups with arms, v steps, arm patterns, skaters.
* DANCE WALK: Moves like hand clasps, step taps, side steps, circle moves.

There are 3 exercises in each routine. Jessica, Debbie (Jessica's Mom) who is doing an easier version of the moves, and Beth, who is doing a more advanced version of the moves.

Why I love this DVD:
* Jessica. She is real, she is enthusiastic and she makes me smile.
* The moves are fun! It doesn't feel like exercise, it's more about getting up and moving and feeling fantastic after you're done.
* The peppy and fun music. The music perfectly fits the moves, so you are inspired to keep your energy up.
* The pretty setting. It's so nice to see sunshine and an inviting pool. I live in New England where it is often cold and grey. This set helps me escape.

If you are looking for some fun ways to add movement into your life, you will enjoy this DVD.",positive
9,Entertainment Collectibles,Walk On: 15-Minute Fast Fat Blasts DVD with Jessica Smith,$16.97,4,"Jessica Smith leads four 15 Minute indoor walks on this DVD, this is the first walk on the disc: Fast Fat Burn. This was an interval workout with some newish moves, such as side steps into traveling jumping jacks. The impact was there if you wanted it, but Jessica‚Äôs mom, Debbie, was showing the modifications. It seemed to pack a lot into the 15 minutes, and just felt good with a nice flow.
Belly Blaster - This one was also good, it had some new and different ab moves within the context of a walking workout. I love the innovation in these, definitely don't feel like the normal walking workouts that I'm used to.
Power Pick Up - Jessica describes this one as a pick me up when you are low energy, and I appreciate that there are some different moves here, but not a lot of impact so it really felt like something that would boost energy without leaving you drained.
Cardio Dance - This was super fun, almost entirely low impact (with Debbie modifying as needed), there is one suggestion of a jump, but I felt that it was more of a bounce into the end of a grapevine. I may be in the minority (especially if you poll houseguests and neighbors) but I love clapping in a workout. It feels like being cheered on, even if the only person cheering is myself. This one had tons of clapping, so of course I loved it, and the crowd went wild. Well done, Jessica.",positive
10,Entertainment Collectibles,Back to life: The complete healthy back system DVD - 3 phase workout program,$54.00,2,"I disliked the fact that this was suppose to be some great exercise that would give you great relief in a very short time. It is yoga represented in a way to make you think it has greater benefits. It does not incorporate alternate examples of the exercises shown. It is not for those who cannot get on the floor. And like with yoga (which is priced at a lower rate), if you do it, you will get better. But you have to do it at least 3x a week. Check out Yoga Vitality (Chair yoga for healthy aging). Its a great video for those who wants to do the exercises but can't get on the floor. I already have Yoga Vitality and others. I just have to use it. Key words ""use it"".
