0,Amazon Explore,Get up-close with wild animals in Costa Rica at the Toucan Rescue Ranch,$7.50 - $27.30,5,"Where have these experiences been all my life?! I stumbled across this and picked an animal one for my 11 year old. She absolutely loved it! The animals were plentiful, instructor was great to listen to and gave tons of information. Turned a boring afternoon into an adventure. I will be trying many other experiences! Let someone else entertain your kiddos while you kick back and relax. Bonus that your kids can take pictures of the animals during the experience",positive
1,Amazon Explore,Get up-close with wild animals in Costa Rica at the Toucan Rescue Ranch,$7.50 - $27.30,5,"We were hoping to meet some sloths for our son's birthday, but got WAY more than we bargained for! Our guide, Andrea, was exceptional! She knew the answers to every question we had about the animals at both the rescue and sanctuary. Not only was she knowledgeable, but extremely friendly. It's obvious that she loves working at the ranch.

We were able to visit the adult sloths, the nursery with younger sloths, as well as very young babies. Andrea talked about why the animals are there, how they are cared for, and how they decide who is ready for release or may need to stay for lifetime care. This visit sparked a curiosity within our children about animal rescue and rehabilitation that I think they will carry with them for a long time.

It was really special being able to have this one on one time with Andrea and the animals. I would highly recommend this experience and hope that one day we can we can travel to Costa Rica for an in-person visit!",positive
2,Amazon Explore,Get up-close with wild animals in Costa Rica at the Toucan Rescue Ranch,$7.50 - $27.30,5,"This was my first Amazon Explore experience...my guide, Stephanie was very knowledgeable and friendly. I signed up for the group tour but I guess I was the only one scheduled at that time. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone who is interested in seeing animals up close and learning more about the phenomenal work the sanctuary is committed to.",positive
3,Amazon Explore,Get up-close with wild animals in Costa Rica at the Toucan Rescue Ranch,$7.50 - $27.30,5,"This was our first tour on Amazon Explore and didn't disappoint. It was so cool see the animals up close. Our tour guide Stephanie was very informative, helpful. She knew so much about the animals and their efforts to rescue and re-wild the animals. Love the mission of Toucan Rescue Ranch to provide for these animals and try to reintroduce them into the wild.

Highlights were seeing the baby sloths and getting so much information on all of the animals of our tour guide.",positive
4,Amazon Explore,Get up-close with wild animals in Costa Rica at the Toucan Rescue Ranch,$7.50 - $27.30,5,"I was looking for experiences to share with my kids to expand their knowledge of the world. Since my kids are high energy with short attention spans I wasn't sure how it would go, but they really enjoyed the animals, especially the baby sloths. The host was very accommodating and engaged the kids with fun questions and information on the animals. Highly recommend.",positive
5,Amazon Explore,Get up-close with wild animals in Costa Rica at the Toucan Rescue Ranch,$7.50 - $27.30,5,"2.14.22~ Did quite a few of these Amazon Explorer Adventures.
Like who wouldn't want to take a lunchbreak & tour Prague at Sunset?
Gotta say~ The Toucan Rescue Ranch may be my fave.

Originally decided to do it bc I love sloths.
I like any gentle animal that just wants to chill & share love.
Never saw one in person like at a zoo & this option is rather affordable.

The sloths were sleeping but Carlos, my guide. and I got lucky.
Latte the Hibiscus loving sloth was awake & adorable at the end of our journey.
Never been so grateful for the picture taking option as I was with Latte.

It's a Toucan Rescue in Costa Rica so you see toucans & owls that have been saved.
The Toucans are quite fascinating & Beautiful. Tropical Owls are smaller
Dare say didn't know much about toucans besides the front of a cereal box.

Tips~
*All 5 trips have had Hit/Miss Clear Video.
Maybe an A-Z Glitch bc did one directly through a vendor & was fine
Vendor is more expensive but for instance with a 'Rescue' they get all the money
* Must use Pc. No phones. (Probably to help Video Quality)
* Take Pictures. Take Lots of Pictures
Even with blurry video, Pix are crystal clear & great quality when downloaded
* Take Notes
Specially to know what your pix are
Also fun to Google what Guide told you to get Full Experience

Highly Recommend 'Get Up & Close with The Animals' at 'Toucan Rescue Ranch'.
Beautiful Tropical Locale with lush trees, flowers, feathered & furry friends.
Plus you get to do your Good Deed for the Day as you trip helps the ranch.",positive
6,Amazon Explore,Get up-close with wild animals in Costa Rica at the Toucan Rescue Ranch,$7.50 - $27.30,4,"Claudia was very sweet, informative, and accommodating. She gave us choices as to which animals we'd like to see and even gave the sloth a flower to eat to get it up and moving.",positive

8,Amazon Explore,Get up-close with wild animals in Costa Rica at the Toucan Rescue Ranch,$7.50 - $27.30,5,"This was our first ""virtual field trip""/Amazon experience and it was FANTASTIC! Our host, Stephanie (who is a Tropical Biologist) was AWESOME! She was warm, friendly, and highly knowledgeable. She went out of her way to make the tour interactive and to tailor our experience to our interests and background knowledge and to make us feel comfortable and welcomed. We were able to see and learn about sloths and baby sloths, Toucans, parrots, a tropical otter, spider monkeys, and other animals. It was all very interesting and Stephanie did a fantastic job providing a ton of great information and a chance to see a great deal in our 50 minute tour.

My 13 year old son and I both thoroughly enjoyed learning about the history of the Toucan Rescue Ranch (founded and still owned by an expat American who moved to Costa Rico), the animals they rescue and care for, the dangers facing some of the native species and the stories of the ""resident"" animals (animals that have specific circumstances/issues that prevent the Ranch from ""re-wilding"" them).

We learned so much about the various animal species at the Toucan Rescue Ranch and about the common dangers they face (including, sadly and all too commonly, being sought after as pets and then abused or abandoned), and the wonderful work done by the Rescue Ranch to care for and rehabilitate any animal that is brought to them and to provide education to student groups that visit as well as to tourists visiting Costa Rico. Such important work they do!

In summary, I simply cannot recommend this experience, or our host/guide Stephanie, highly enough! We had an amazing time AND simultaneously were doing a small part to help fund the Toucan Rescue Ranch by participating in this experience. The Ranch receives no public funding from the Costa Rican government and relies on donations. The cost of this experience goes towards helping to fund their much needed and amazing work!!

If you are considering signing up for an Amazon Experience, SIGN UP FOR THIS ONE! It will be enjoyable and memorable for any age from small kiddos to grandparents! You will not regret it and you will be helping to support the important work of a wonderful organization.

Thank you, Miss Stephanie, for making our experience so wonderful and memorable. If we ever travel to Costa Rico (which this tour made me want to do!), we will absolutely be visiting the Toucan Rescue Ranch!",positive
9,Amazon Explore,Get up-close with wild animals in Costa Rica at the Toucan Rescue Ranch,$7.50 - $27.30,5,"This was my first live virtual tour, and a great experience! I happened to be the only participant, so the shared tour ended up like a private tour, which was an unexpected bonus. The tour guide, Andrea, was very knowledgeable, super friendly, and spoke excellent English, making for very easy and smooth communication. Connectivity was great, and the animals were lively and fun to watch. It was wonderful to be able to ask questions and see the farm, hear about some individual rescue stories of the animals peaking into the camera, and much more. When I inquired about support opportunities, I also learned that there is an Amazon wish list for this farm, so I will check this out next. I am quite happy to see opportunities to support rescue facilities that have been impacted by the public closures these last two years, and making it such a fun experience besides!",positive
10,Amazon Explore,Picturesque Prague: Visit the Old Town of the Czech Republic's capital,$12.50 - $49.00,5,"So this was my 2nd Amazon Explore tour and WOW, What a ginormous difference! The first was basically watching our guide walk down a busy (different) city street with the occasional turn at a point of interest, IF the technology worked.

Today was visually and audibly clear. Gorgeous weather. And MARK, our guide, was PHENOMENAL- my husband and I booked a group tour, but no one else selected the same time so we had a 1:1. Mark asked why I picked this tour and when I said the astronomical clock, he ensured we arrived on the hour. (He made my whole day!) This entire experience was a great because he was engaging and personable, knowledgeable and entertaining, AND rather then give us a run of the mill tour- he customized it to fit our desires (Architecture, history & a tad of culture.) My husband had traveled to Prague 25 years ago and I've never been. Mark's tour showed my husband what had changed and gave me a glimpse of a city that looks like it comes straight from a fairytale. We have 2 more tours scheduled for Prague and we cannot wait! After we disconnected, we both said we felt like we were visiting a friend, who was showing us the local sites. Thank you Mark, see you very soon!",positive
11,Amazon Explore,Picturesque Prague: Visit the Old Town of the Czech Republic's capital,$12.50 - $49.00,5,"Took a virtual Prague walking tour with Mark on 7/16/22, and the experience was absolutely amazing! Mark navigated the city and made it super interesting, sharing pieces of history that there was no way I would have learned if I had been in the city physically. He was patient, kind, and sincerely wanted to make this a great experience - he succeeded! It was also interesting to see live the crowds - or lack thereof - and the way people interacted with our tour guide. I highly recommend this tour! Thank you for providing me a little window into your beautiful city!",positive
12,Amazon Explore,Picturesque Prague: Visit the Old Town of the Czech Republic's capital,$12.50 - $49.00,5,"We started off in a quiet square, then onto the busier Old Town Square, and finished at the Municipal House.

18,Amazon Explore,Picturesque Prague: Visit the Old Town of the Czech Republic's capital,$12.50 - $49.00,4,"Only reason for 4 Star rating is because we signed up for the Picturesque Prague tour but received Haunted Prague tour, which we had previously done.

My hostess was GREAT, an experienced guide who knew all sorts of historical facts about Prague and pointed out even small interesting details. I accidentally timed my tour to begin at mid-afternoon in the US but sundown in Prague, and to make things even more interesting a large rain storm came through right after we began, but she didn't let any of that stop her. Being able to speak to her directly as she was speaking to me made it feel like I was THERE and not just watching someone's video. I enjoyed this immensely.",positive

The video and sound quality was better than I could have hoped for. Marco kept chatting with my kids and was very interactive while giving a clear and thorough history lesson at the same time.

In the tour Adriana provided so much information, like discussing the laws in Costa Rica that banned people from keeping exotic pets, resulting in many former pets being moved to the wildlife sanctuary. We got to see so many wonderful animals; including different types of toucans and macaws (and even a friendly hybrid macaw), different kinds of monkeys, iguanas, a caiman, and a sassy peccary named Miss Piggy. We got to see feeding time and watched the birds having a nice meal of bananas and papaya. Adriana also pointed out some beautiful plants, including one that collects rainwater which some birds can drink.

We all really enjoyed this tour, and we appreciated Adriana’s patience in answering all our questions.

If you've never done this type of Amazon experience, I highly recommend it because it just you and the tour guide. I really enjoyed this short and affordable tour of Sensoji temple and the surrounding neighborhood. We were lucky that our internet connect was stable throughout the tour. Your experience my differ depending on the strength of your tour guide's internet connection.
Chieri is an very enthusiastic and energetic tour guide. She is very considerate about checking if I had any questions and recommended spots to take the photos on the Amazon Experience camera. She pointed out a lot of small details on our tour.
It was early morning in Japan (evening time for me) as we started the tour from Nishisando shopping street. The shops were not open for business yet. Chieri pointed out the modern Tokyo Skytree Tower in the distance as you approach the serene Sensoji temple grounds.
Chieri explained the different protective symbols used on wooden temple structures against fires. You'll see the historical large water buckets and the lotus shaped container used for putting out fires in the past. A few people were walking around the temple grounds. The neighborhood was very quiet due to Japan's central government declaring a third state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
I studied Japanese long time ago so I had fun reading Kanji on the different signs, banners and temple plaques on the tour. Chieri was very kind to help me figure out kanji I didn't recognize.
We ended the tour on the Sensoji temple grounds with a view of Sensoji temple framed by 5-story pagoda and a weeping cherry tree.",positive

Momoka was our Sensoji temple guide in Tokyo. The tour was super interesting and the temple was really beautiful, even though we were seeing it through the video and not in real life. Momoka pointed out lots of things we would probably not have noticed if touring by ourselves in person, including letting us get close up to all the beautiful little touches throughout. She answered all of our questions patiently and thoroughly (as well as the questions of our VERY excited children - 6 and 9 years old), including the silly ones. Our 6 year old took over 100 pictures (LOL)!

She seemed very knowledgable about the subject and even did a personal prayer for me at one of the temples.

We covered a lot in the 50 minute tour but viewed the ancient forums from overlooks rather than walking through the ruins which allowed us to see the forums as a whole and had pictures to show what the first forum would have looked like in ancient Roman times. The tour would have had to be several hours to actually walk through the ruins.

Plus, it was more interesting because the teacher/host was in the country, so it was food from her own heritage. I liked hearing about how her family eats them, how her grandmother makes them, and how popular they are in Argentina. Thanks, Noelia! I got this as a birthday gift to myself, and think it would make a great gift for anyone who enjoys cooking and travel.",positive

Overall, I think the stories on this tour was more spooky then those on the ghost tour. You hear about the headless spirits on this tour vs the Golem and the mummified hand on the ghost tour. Both tours are fun and the stories are very entertaining, very much worth taking in these experiences. And the scenery of the old section of Prague is awesome. Mark is also a very fun guide to take a tour with.",positive

221,Amazon Explore,Learn to make Mexican tacos and tortillas with a professional chef,$11.00 - $35.00,5,"This was truly an unbelievable experience! Martin, our host, was fantastic!! While we signed up for a group session, no one else joined, so we had a private class with Martin. He would stop and go back if we had a questions or show us something closer if we wanted to take a better photo. He gave us tips and tricks for slicing and dicing. He showed us an extra-special thing we could do (we didn't actually do it this time) to make the tortillas even prettier. He let us take a little longer on the things we were a bit slower on, like getting the consistency of the dough just right. When we were finished, we had delicious tacos (some veggie and some meat) that looked as close to his as I could hope for. He also gave us suggestions for additional toppings. I have been telling all my friends and family, because it seems that not enough people know about Amazon Explore. Anyone who is reading this, definitely try Amazon Explore, and better yet, get one of the sessions with Mexican Food Tours, or best of all, one led by Martin. You will enjoy it! We loved it!",positive

By the time I was done I had a meat taco, a veggie taco, and the best corn tortillas I've ever had. Pablo is quite knowledgeable about cooking techniques and seasoning and guided me about what spices I should add to each taco. I've made tacos for dinner on many occassions, but never this tasty. They look and taste gourmet but so easy to make! Pablo said he also has a salsa making lesson. I am excited to do that one next! P.S. The image were taken by me during the cooking lesson using the camera provided in the Explore app. Amazing!",positive

226,Amazon Explore,Learn to make Mexican tacos and tortillas with a professional chef,$11.00 - $35.00,4,"Esther was a great teacher. Thanks for the fun experience cooking with my mom. Couple things to improve on—we did have a bad connection at times even though I have fast internet (100). When she turned her head and continued to speak the sound of so muffled we had to constantly ask her to repeat. Maybe a microphone attached to their apron would fix this. And on the class, it listed the ingredients and would say “diced” etc. We took that as needing to prep beforehand. But Esther cut it all in class and did it differently so it would have been great to just do it with her, her way. Maybe list the ingredients but don’t put how to chop them, so you can follow how the chef does it. Just a thought. We’ll definitely sign up for another class!",positive

I wish I could upload a picture but for some reason the amazon app won't let me and I wish you could see how beautiful the food was. I am not a professional chef at all and the finished product was authentic, restaurant quality food. She even showed me how to garnish the plate, what toppings to include, and tricks for getting the tortilla to that gorgeous soft, yet toasted texture for the finishing touch.

He's very knowledgable of history and current events. He connected the history to the architecture, culture, economy, and people which provided a deep understanding of Mendoza. The process of booking was very easy and I was impressed with the service. The video quality was excellent, and the equipment our guide used ensured that we had a smooth viewing experience. One of the abilities of the system is that the guide can present relevant pictures and videos to even further enhance the experience. Charlie's additional drone video of the city gave was yet another impressive perspective.

I bought this tour experience as a gift for my dad for Father’s Day and he was so impressed with how informative Ms. Florencia was. She shared great information about the rich culture and history of the city- including it’s oil refinery and the many wineries. Unknowingly to us, it was holiday, so the shops were closed and there weren’t many locals out, but it was still a wonderful experience that the whole family could participate in from the comfort and (COVID) safety of our home!

Charlie was a wonderful host being both knowledgeable and witty. It felt like an old friend giving you a tour instead of a stranger. He was able to teach us so much about his city in the short time we had together. One of the things we discussed was the local making of wine and after the tour I found I did in fact have wine from Mendoza on my shelf. I opened the bottle later that day. Charlie sold me on his city and would love to actually vacation there.,positive
