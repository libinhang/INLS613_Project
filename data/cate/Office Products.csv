0,Office Products,"Amazon Basics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper - White, 8.5 x 11 Inches","$8.49 - $1,619.00",5,"I picked this up because I needed some decent-quality, lighter weight paper for double-sided black and white laser printing. (The paper I usually have on hand is super thick, which is great for color printing and more professional applications, but is HEAVY.)

Honestly, I expected this to feel cheap. I was okay with that. I'm printing multi-page newsletters, and didn't need anything super thick; I needed something light enough that seven or eight pages would be less than two ounces to mail.

And I was pleasantly surprised by this paper. Not only is it lightweight, but it's also really well-made somehow. I don't get any show-through on double sided pages, and it's consistently good. My printer loves it and gets no jams or mangled pages, and the surface is just textured enough that the printing sticks like a charm. I have no problems folding or creasing it, and I don't get the feel that it'll fall apart or disintegrate, despite both its weight and its price tag. It's fairly bright white, too.

Honestly, I'm not sure why I didn't switch to this brand sooner. I'll still keep my heavier (Hammermill) paper for things that need to be more professional, but I'll definitely keep buying it for all other printing, both laser and ink jet.",positive

2,Office Products,"Amazon Basics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper - White, 8.5 x 11 Inches","$8.49 - $1,619.00",5,"I read some 1 star reviews for this pager, but my experience is the complete opposite. This is great paper. The paper itself looks clean and smooth close up. It handles ink great from my Canon printer. Great price and great value.

My guess for some 1 star reviews is that there are different lots. So maybe every year there are different manufacturers or the paper pulp they receive is different.

I ordered and received this 500 sheet paper in July 2022 and love the paper.

I hope next time I order it, it will be the same great product.",positive

They are durable pencils. The lead doesn't easily break when you need to sharpen them.

They seem to have the smoothest writing, be the easiest to sharpen (sometimes cheap pencils just feel gross when you sharpen them but these have a clean feel), and the erasers are excellent and seem to never develop that gross hard film or just spread your pencil marks around on the paper.

20,Office Products,EXPO 1871133 Low-Odor Dry Erase Markers,$4.29 - $72.04,5,"I like these because they don’t dry out quickly. They can last several months of light use, no problem, where other brands I’ve tried dry out just sitting there.

They are pretty easy to clean. I use a white board spray and a paper towel at the end of a project to get everything cleaned off, and even writing that has been sitting untouched for months comes right off. The eraser will leave a little ghosting, but that’s normal.

The colors are pretty good, none of them too light to be read easily. There is one that is particularly pale, but it’s not too bad.

They are supposed to be low odor, but I don’t smell a thing with these. I don’t go sniffing markers, but I don’t notice a small when I’m using them.

They make a nice, thin line. This might be too think if you’re using a whiteboard for a conference room or a classroom, but for personal use, such as Kamban or family notes or something like that, where everyone who needs to see it can walk up to it, it’s fine.",positive
21,Office Products,EXPO 1871133 Low-Odor Dry Erase Markers,$4.29 - $72.04,5,"Good markers. I chose this brand because I remember my teachers using them. It seems to be holding up nicely. No other colors have dried out. I hope to get a few months use out of them—that should be standard with somewhat daily use. The colors do stain but I noticed not as much when I swipe it clean and not in circles so do a one way motion to get it off and you won’t have to use your board cleaner as much! The pink color came somewhat dried out but I can still use it but I think that will be the first one go. All in all, a great pack of ultra fine dry-erase markers!

I would buy it again.",positive
22,Office Products,EXPO 1871133 Low-Odor Dry Erase Markers,$4.29 - $72.04,5,"I ran out of wipe away markers for my fridge wipe away board. I was looking for a finer tip wipe away marker. I use my board to keep track of my daily to do list as well as a reminder that we need this or that from the stores. I also use it for mental notes that I may forget.

I looked at a few generic brands until I saw these were on sale for a good deal.

What I received:
8 dry erase/wipe away board markers. These are ULTRA fine tip. I was surprised how fine tipped they are.

These write like a fine ball pen. Not as much like a marker. The colors are vibrant. There is no odor that I can smell.

One of the reason I like Expo markers:
They last a long time. Some generic ones I end up replacing sooner than later.

These do NOT have a magnet on them to put on a metal surface.",positive
23,Office Products,EXPO 1871133 Low-Odor Dry Erase Markers,$4.29 - $72.04,5,"I was hoping that the ""EXPO"" name brand was an indication that these markers would be a grade better than the schlock I currently have.
The photo tells the tale - pale - and most are unreadable from 3-4 feet away on a white board. IMHO, the new markers are paler than my exhausted markers.
CORRECTION - - -
Once the markers were placed POINT DOWN (vertical), their intensity JUMPED to satisfactory.
Do not store these horizontally.",positive
24,Office Products,EXPO 1871133 Low-Odor Dry Erase Markers,$4.29 - $72.04,4,These pens are the traditional dry erase pens but with a fine tip. There are several different colors.

I love the fine point for more accurate writing and the variety of colors is great. Some colors are brighter than others but overall they are all good and usable! You can't beat the price! I left a message on my board overnight to see how well it would erase the next day-no problem! It erased perfectly with no residue on the board.

Had Abraham Lincoln had this tape in 1860, the South would not have been able to secede. This stuff is so strong, it transcends the physical realm. It will keep your relationship together. If your boyfriend is about to leave you, just take this out of the drawer and show it to him. You don't even need to apply it. Its power is so strong he will be unable to leave you.

I received it in pronto delivery! The tape was packaged very well, not like some reviewers had received theirs. Tape was in a cellophane bag sealed, and then in a zip-lock type bag. The tape was in tack, not sticking to the cellophane. It was easy to cut with scissors to my specifications. The adhesive is great.
I needed this to install a light under my cabinet by my stove (the microwave light shorted out, no bulb could fix it). Not wanting to stick the light to the metal underside of my microwave (the light has magnets which could possible damage the microwave magnetic waves), I placed it under the adjoining cabinet.

I put it on the back of a pop socket and then put it on the back of my phone, and it has not come off I’ve been hanging it upside down to see if it pops off and it doesn’t!!!.

The window is surrounded by tile and doesn't have depth which made it difficult even with tension rods. I wanted a shade but did not want to drill into the tile. This tape received so many good reviews that I decided to give it a shot. I purchased a lightweight roman shade roughly 3-4 lbs. and adhered a strip of this tape to the whole metal header of the shade. This stuff is sticky, pretty sure I lost some fingerprints when applying it. It's been about a month and so far it is still holding. I open and close this shade everyday.",positive

Pictures still there after a few months and did not get loose or fell off. I had some other mounting tape and it was a challenge to keep the object I have clued to a wall in place. It was getting un-stuck and in the end I has to use contact cement on the wall to get a permanent mount.
You do not want to leave it without packaging to prolong its life but the zip-lock bag it came with was stuck to the tape so badly that I had to tear it to get the tape out.

This TI graphing calculator is a purchase for my daughter to get her through high school and college math and science. It is an amazing calculator and I have no complaints about it or Texas Instruments.

Second:
Here is my complaint. In the product listing for this Ti-84 plus ce (color purple) it clearly states that this is the newer python edition. What arrived was not. Since this was handled by Amazon services Llc, lack of control over third party resellers cannot be blamed. I feel that there is less and less oversight over product listings as I also read many reviews and read this very same complaint. I understand that prime member dues will increase and with supply chain issues I also understand that some prime item may not make it to me in two days. How difficult is it to relay the correct information in a product listing. That is essentially a bait and switch.

79,Office Products,Amazon Basics Pre-sharpened Wood Cased #2 HB Pencils,$4.24 - $14.16,5,"At the end of the school year, I always buy a pack of pencils to replenish my depleted stock. (I teach 7th and 8th grade English). Last year, I bought 144 golf pencils for about $8. It was a great investment, because a lot of times, I have kids who ALWAYS forget a pencil. They aren’t the ones who necessarily need a pencil, because more often than not, they would lose the pencil again before they made a mistake. However, despite having 144 of them, I ran out in late April, with about two months still left in the school year. I will buy another pack of those golf pencils for the students who perpetually borrow a pencil, but I quickly learned that every so often, I had a student who really needed a pencil, but wasn’t someone who made a habit of bringing nothing to class. Likewise, these were students were the ones who didn’t need it for a few periods, but truly needed a new pencil for them to keep for weeks. Unfortunately, I didn't have any “real” pencils, and when I saw these AmazonBasic pencils on sale (96 for about $6 – regularly they’re less than $8), I knew I needed these as well.

I’m actually really picky about my own personal pencils. I have a favorite brand, and I have a favorite brand of erasers to put on them. Nevertheless, I was really excited to try out these pencils because although they didn't have the price tag of a Dixon-Ticonderoga, they still worked really well.

QUALITY:

These are just your every day, basic pencils, but that’s how I like mine. I hate pencils with that plastic film with a design printed on them. With “cute” pencils, you aren’t paying for the pencil, you’re paying for whatever logo is on it (like Frozen or Star Wars). When you sharpen those ones for the first time, the film splits and then the cute design ends up peeling off. However, these AmazonBasics pencils were easy to sharpen, and they were nice to write with. Sometimes, pencils are prone to have the graphite split so there is a strange press on the paper, resulting in “double” writing. I wrote for a bit with the pencil and even as it dulled, it still wrote nicely. You can note a small letter I wrote to test it; it is the third image.

ERASER:

Another thing I hate about cheap pencils is the garbage erasers. As a teacher, I write most things in pen, but I always do my grade book in pencil. If a student turns in something late, I need to erase the previous grade to change it, and I can’t stand having left over marks from a bad eraser. Now, as I mentioned, I have one specific brand of erasers which are honestly God’s gift to humanity, and I always slap one of those bad boys on my pencils, but this really wasn’t bad as far as erasers go. I mean, it was still obvious that I made a mistake, but I also press into the paper like I’m trying to cut a hole into the table underneath. I write DARK. I have many students who press lightly. As well, if I were drawing, I would draw lighter. In the third picture attached to this review, there are two instances of erasing. The first is over “film” in fourth line in the first paragraph. The other is the second paragraph, titled “Eraser test.” As I mentioned, I write so dark that it’s difficult to erase to the point where it doesn’t appear that there was a mistake at all, but I also think your average person wouldn’t mind. I can clearly make out what is written over the erased bits, and no annoying parts of the eraser were left behind (like a giant pink smudge… Ugh, I hate that the most).

SMUDGE TEST:

Speaking of smudges, I don’t frequently smudge my pencil work because I’m right handed. However, I have left handed students who turn in work that is barely legible because they drag their hand throughout their writing constantly. Thinking of them, I wanted to test out how badly the graphite smudged on a hand. The results are the fourth picture. Now, this wasn’t just me carefully dragging my hand over the paper; I really pressed, TRYING to smudge the words. And yeah, I did smudge it a bit, and yeah, I did get some graphite on my hand. However, this is NOTHING compared to some of the other pencils I’ve seen. As you can see from my hand, it was minor, considering I was literally pressing hard on the paper, trying to get the graphite on my hand.

OVERALL:

The bottom line is that a 12 pack of any type of pencils can go for over $2. In fact, a lot of times the “cute” pencils are the most expensive, but they’re the worst as far as quality. If looks aren’t a thing you care about, but do care about quality, these are the best deal. A 96 pack of Ticonderoga pencils can range from $14-$20 (depending on packaging and color and where you’re buying them). I always use Ticonderogas as the standard for the perfect pencil because I used them throughout my childhood; my mother was literally born in Ticonderoga, NY. However, the AmazonBasics are the best bang for your buck. Are they cute? Is your kid going to be inspired by the cool Frozen or Star Wars logo? No. Because this is a standard, BASIC pencil. They’re just yellow. But to be honest, those “cool looking” pencils always lack quality compared to something like this. The simplicity is what makes these pencils so great; they’re just pencils. They know their function, and they get the job done. These are definitely going to be my “good” pencils from now on, especially to give out to kids who really are responsible with their supplies.",positive

It's easier and bigger than a bullet journal, which I love, although I don't usually use the months section extensively. Very helpful for college.

This planner is great and a much better deal on Amazon (if you get the plain cover lol). It's only around $10 for a large planner. The in-store versions had more decorated options but were pricier and smaller. I'm fine with the plain black covers because they can be easily decorated. They also look good as is.

120,Office Products,Sharpie Fine Point Permanent Marker,$4.99 - $35.96,5,"I've always loved Sharpies, namely, the ultra-fine and fine point types. On some surfaces, the stuff you write/mark needs to be allowed to dry for a fairly short amount of time or else you can smear it and then not be able to undo the smeared/messed up part, but on some surfaces it's set right away. Either way, once it's set, it stays that way. I have stuff I wrote I've written on with a Sharpie many years, even decades ago, that's still good as new or maybe only with a little wear. Of course, I'm not talking about just writing on paper, in which case you'd obviously expect that. But I'm talking about surfaces such as rubber or certain types of plastic that you can't or can't easily or clearly write on with ""normal"" pens at all: those were easy to use a Sharpie on and what I wrote or drew on those surfaces stays there for as long as I'd ever need (probably until after I die, after decades of being very useful and reliable!).

I also haven't had any of these leak on me, as I've had many normal ink pens do over the years, sometimes ruining something like a shirt I liked a lot. No Sharpie has ever done that to me, though, I'm happy to say! I've also packed these in suitcases during not only more local, but also during long international flights, when the flying altitude is quite high and at least sometimes, I assume the baggage compartments were not pressurized. Yet, they've always survived well, never rupturing or even leaking. Maybe I've just been lucky, but if that's the case, then I've been lucky countless times and feel very safe with Sharpie products, as well as feeling like if any ink pen is going to write on a surface (without being a ""paint"" type pen that's much more expensive and usually unnecessary), then these will do the job, and last long enough to make me feel like I got my money's worth.

Lastly, it's worth noting that in this case, ""name brand"" status can really make a difference, and for very, very little money (spending a few more cents for Sharpies than a budget brand isn't like buying a Rolex!). It might be easy to forget about this if you're looking for a bargain on a minor item like markers, so I thought this worth mentioning here, even though I've never mentioned this factor in any previous review of anything else. Maybe it's partially because you can have the best name-brand item for such little investment when you're talking about markers. But mostly, it's because the Sharpie is so well-known, and for so many decades, in many professions as being THE ""professional"" marker (the only one, really), one that any/every TRUE pro in that given profession uses without exception. In fact, people in my past line of work never asked for a marker. No matter what company or client was involved, no matter where we were on a cross-country tour (at least in the USA, but maybe also elsewhere: I'm just not qualified to say for sure what the case is in other countries), everyone always just said, ""Hey, do you have a Sharpie?"" or ""I need a Sharpie, please."" Sharpie was equivalent to the word ""marker,"" but was used instead as the most natural, normal thing to say instead of marker, which just goes to show how much it's the accepted standard that, when violated, stands out. That is, if someone asks for a Sharpie (meaning, marker), and you hand them something else, they WILL notice that it's not the normal, high-quality marker they expected.

Sharpies are the gold standard in multiple business worlds, I know, but the one I happened to work in had me doing production and/or tour management within various popular music genres (e.g., various types of ""rock,"" pop, etc.). Working in various roles in the music business, many times I found myself playing roles in which I would need to be able to provide a marker to an artist (musician) so they could use it give their autograph to a fan on a very wide variety of potential surfaces that they wanted signed. I always had the production case well-stocked with Sharpies (and if I hadn't, anyone else stocking it would have inevitably and only used Sharpies), not only due to their ability to do the job and do so reliably no matter what odd things fans wanted signed, and no matter what varied surfaces the production crew might need to write upon, but also, to be honest even though it's unpopular to admit you do something due to wanting to present a certain ""image,"" because it was the ONLY pen that a true ""pro"" would use.

Whether it was so that fans would know they were dealing with true pros (""fine point"" are the standard for autographs, or marking on things like boxes, btw), or so that our business associates such as the local production companies (if I was touring) or the touring crew (if I was doing local production) would know they were dealing with the highest caliber on our end as well. Like anyone taking their career and careers of those they work with, as well as their organization's success seriously, I'm sure you want to be seen as a pro for various reasons, including letting those you do business with, your customers/clients, those who you buy from, etc. feel confident that in working with you, they're working with true pros at the top of their game, providing the best products or services available in your field. It instills confidence on others' part when they see you using the gold standard tools, and in the case of permanent markers, that happens to be Sharpies. Using any other brand just doesn't say ""I'm a pro"" like a Sharpie does. And worse, it can make it seem like you're a ""wannabe,"" someone who's just very new in your field and unaware of how things work, or possibly even a failure, who cares more for saving just a piddly few bucks or cents than for providing the best quality available of whatever you provide. It's not even about the pens when it comes to this issue, of course. But the impression you give off about yourself can be affected by something that's seemingly (but not really) so insignificant as the brand of marker you use. That's not true about what paper brand of staples or paper you use, imo. I'm not saying every single thing matters like this. But for whatever reason, Sharpies have long been the default marker that pros use, possibly in your field as well. And your overall presentation of yourself and your business to any who see that pen, even if you're not actually using it, can translate into more than enough additional dollars you make as a result of being seen as a reliable pro as you could possibly save buying any other brand, as odd as that seems hearing myself write these words (normally, I don't think this way, and I wouldn't say this about most stuff I'd use in my business activities).

But it's also the case that, in my experience (and I have occasionally used other brands of markers that other people gave me to use), Sharpies are as good as or better than any other marker I've ever used. As should be the case, ""image"" doesn't have to matter here: if you just want the best, most reliable permanent marker out there, you'd get a Sharpie anyway.

And btw, no, I do not have ANY investments in the Sharpie company, if that's what they're called, or any other possible personal benefit in recommending these pens!",positive

160,Office Products,HP Printer Paper,$9.99 - $159.00,5,"I truly don't understand how it's even possible for those with low star ratings/reviews can even claim their paper came crumbled..?! How is that even possible, with the extent in which this supplier strives to ensure their product is protected..? I mean, come in -the packaging they send this paper in is honestly the most reinforced, durable cardboard I've ever seen something shipped in in my life... And not only that, they take additional measurements to pack that already sturdy, tightly fitted package and put it in ANOTHER study box that is snug to a point where the paper inside has no room to really even move around amidst transit... & Thus, I seriously don't understand how it's even possible for anyone to recieve a damaged product?? 💀🤣 Unless someone's fist fighting with their Amazon order from the time it leaves the factory, to the point it arrives on their porch??

Anyway... I really appreciate the sooner -than expected arrival 😊 especially since it was already only going to take 4 days to get here, it's always a treat the rare times prime gets here even earlier than how quickly they already fill orders!

I strongly advise for you to buy the HP paper , over the Amazon basics, which is reccomended alongside this product, & might be the ultimate purchase decision, for someone that doesn't slow down & realize.. The name Brand product is LITERALLY only CENTS more, for premium, higher quality product...

Reviews are the driving point behind why so many of us are inclined to make our purchases, or opt for a product over another... And frugal nuts like me can accidentally be swift to get the ""bargain"" item without considering the name Brand as thoroughly, especially when most of the time it truly isn't this close in cost to get that higher tier item... I promise, you won't regret opting for this product - it's not thin , its surprisingly durable for standard printer / copy paper, it's GREAT for laser printers and prints much higher quality documents, that other generic branded paper I've tested out & compared... Oh, and it's nice that the paper is unexpected BRIGHT white, especially since it's not specially labeled to be brighter than standard.

Seriously, this product is nice, and don't listen to anyone that might make you worry your product will arrived damaged.. remarkable quality in all regards with this supplier on this end :) will be a return consumer from this point on!",positive
161,Office Products,HP Printer Paper,$9.99 - $159.00,5,"This paper works fine in my laser printer and is at reasonable price. It seems to leave the printer clean.

Bottom line, HP Office 20 is great paper in my experience.",positive
162,Office Products,HP Printer Paper,$9.99 - $159.00,5,This printer paper is reasonably priced & works great for any regular print job. Can’t comment on quality of color since nearly all of our printing is B & W.,positive
163,Office Products,HP Printer Paper,$9.99 - $159.00,5,"This note is for HP Office20 ~ It does laser-print perfectly, but that's expected.
Initial tests with a dark fountain pen ink (noodler's saguaro in a 1.5 stub italic) show zero feather, and although 20lb weight will have minor showthrough to the back, there is no bleed-through unless the paper is scraped or ink is excessively thick. So I can satisfyingly put my signature on this paper.
Technical pen ink and Pigma pens also work fine, Office20 is absorbent enough to dry fast and minimize smudge, but doesn't feather. Graphite and colored pencil shows a hint of grain along the 11"" axis, but unless you're doing fine art, it's fine, neither too toothy nor too smooth.
Also I often use watercolor on office paper; bad papers absorb instantly, but Office20 delays absorption just right. The paper still warps when wet, of course, but actually less than I expected. Maybe it's this inkjet ColorLok thing all the paper manufacturers are using. Seems impressive for a thin 20lb everyday paper. I actually have used 20lb and 24lb office papers in the past that performed worse with water media, so I think this is good stuff for people who add hand-drawing to printouts.",positive

Doctors at clinical have borrowed my pens and came up to me to let me know that I wasn't getting the pen back because they love them lol.

220,Office Products,"Scotch Heavy Duty Packaging Tape, 1.88"" x 22.2 yd, Designed for Packing with Scotch Box Lock Packaging Tape, 6 Rolls",$14.98 - $39.99,5,"It's packing tape... That says most of it. Here are the trials and tribulations of our experience, maybe it'll help or maybe you already stopped reading.

Pros:
- Very Tape-like
- Sticks to other sticky or plasticy things very well
- Convenient grab and go dispensers, perfect for when you set one down for just a sec and then never ever find it again
- Small rolls and dispenser are good for packaging small things and using small sections at a time
- Once you get the tape to stick it usually stays stuck even when you are ready to unstick whatever you wanted stuck originally. I recommend a blade of your choice -- small will work fine, but large is much cooler.

Cons:
- Does not always want to stick to cardboard. Work around this inconvenient flaw by rubbing your starting section rapidly for 3-10 seconds to create friction heat before trying to pull against the tape to dispense more. If that doesn't work, give up, because that piece has already been ruined by cardboard fiber. It will need to be cut off and thrown out, where it will gladly stick to all sides of your trash bag and turn it into a ruined wad of plastic. Fold the sticky sides together before disposing for optimal ease, or don't for optimal wastefulness and irritation.
- Sometimes the ""Easy Start"" on a fresh roll really doesn't want to peel up, making it very difficult to use the tape to pack anything. Do NOT use scissors to try to fix the problem, you'll only make it worse and will probably hurt yourself in the process. Not that I would know...
- Rolls are small and do not go far or last long, especially when you waste a bunch by using scissors to start the roll.
- The sound made by the dispenser while taping a large box closed is detrimental to any sane humans mental well-being and should not be repeated too frequently.
- For reasons stated above I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE FOR PACKING ALL OF YOUR BELONGINGS INTO BOXES WHEN YOU WANT TO MOVE. Get the larger dispensers and rolls, don't make moving harder to save a couple bucks, it's not worth it.

In conclusion, this tape did most of what I expect my tape to be capable of. While we may have had some creative differences, overall it stuck with me through the good and bad, really helped hold things together when I was sure they would fall apart, and adhered to most of my expectations without a complaint --1 star",positive

The dispenser has a lip so that the tape stays on the dispenser and doesn't go back to stick to itself, although I can't say that never happens; it still can, but at least there is a mechanism to help prevent it. The price on Amazon was pretty reasonable for the 6 tape dispensers. Amazon prices do change all the time so be sure to price check online before you buy to get the best price. I actually had bought this exact same product from another Amazon seller a while back but when I did a search I noticed that this seller's price was better so I switched over to them.",positive

225,Office Products,"Scotch Heavy Duty Packaging Tape, 1.88"" x 22.2 yd, Designed for Packing with Scotch Box Lock Packaging Tape, 6 Rolls",$14.98 - $39.99,5,"I do a lot of business with Amazon. More specifically, I am the only member of my household who does the vast majority of ordering with the company and I, just little ole' me, turn in 30-90 orders a month with the company. Not all of them are huge, but that is not what is important. It is of interest because as one person, who orders mainly for herself including general family needs, with the additional occasional ""Hey Honey, don't forget to order me that Purple Marlin Spinning Bait I happened to see in that special Warehouse sale that ends in 42 more minutes, you know, just sayin'"", I post a LOT of orders with this Company. Going to Targets or Wahlmart has come to seem like an awful nuisance. I have better things to do with my time. Sleeping is always an attractive option.
But really, I order most of the family and household general needs from Amazon. Subscribe and Save has become a way of life.
But, as with any systme where ordering sight unseen is involved, things go askew from time to time. I used to be the old gal who repacked things with a ton of Scotch plastic tape which is really meant for Christmas presents. Then I would go dig out hubby's Masking tape. When that was gone, I used that heavy duty stuff that is generally used to hold pipes in place.
Finally, I got a clue. If you order, you will have to send back. Amazon sends things out in tidy little boxes with air filled little plastic packing protectors which are JUST PERFECT for returning that lovely decorative, metal, orange polka dot and turquoise colored Gecko wall decoration that the five year old was Just Certain Grampa would like on the wall in his hunting lodge in Ontario. Keep in mind that dear old dad was here to push the button when that order went through!?! So, there must be a way to tape these mishaps back into their original packing boxes without resorting to the use of the Christmas Scotch Tape.
Having learned to whip around the Amazon site at the speed of light, I zoomed right over to ""Packing Tape in Office Supplies."" I automatically hit the Prime button and went on my search. Bingo. This pack of six Heavy Duty Packaging Tape Rolls popped right up. I also had the option of getting LARGE rolls of tape and purchasing a GUN to hold the tape to use for my return needs. But, I am NOT THAT BIG an Amazon shopper. Besides, I might forget what that GUN was for and take my hostilities out on that Purple Marlin Lure. So, I ordered the box of six rolls of tape which are two inches wide. They come with their own little red plastic holder so that I do not have to sign up for Gun safety lessons at the local rifle range.
Six Rolls Of Tape. Tape held in a small red plastic holder. Snap the small cardboard piece out of the way so that the tape can roll. Print your return labels. One goes in the package. No tape required here. The other label goes ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX in which the returning item was originally shipped in. Carefully close the box after making certain that 1. The item originally ordered in carefully packed back in the box. 2. CHECK AND MAKE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that label Number one is packed with the item being returned. 3. Hold the box carefully so that all the edges make contact and no open spaces remain at the top of the box. 4. Cut label number 2 as indicated on your computer print out. 5. SECURELY FASTEN LABEL NUMBER TWO TO THE TOP OF THE BOX. This means using more than one strip of tape. If the thin little computer paper label rips because YOU were stingy with tape, then YOU are the one who loses a refund when the entire box ends up in the LOST FILE with UPS or the Post Office. (I wonder if those guys get all of last year's lost packages at Christmast time?...well...a Government Agency would absolutely not stand for that sort of thing, but it is an interesting concept!) Anyway, 5. Tape outer label appropriately. 6. Make certain that no old labels are still hanging around so that the delivery guys can get confused and send that lovely Gecko back to you. 7. Put your tape away. 8. Make certain that you always have enough tape on hand to return any unwanted, broken, or unidentifiable items that you receive from Amazon.

Well, you can see how I make use of this Scotch Heavy Duty Paking Tape. I order and I send back. Occasionally, I actually order something and send it to someone anew; that is, from myself. I have two friends who live in Viet Nam. Not too many companies are jumping up and down to post packages to them. So, I get out the trusty tape and do it myself. I love the stuff. It is just the right size for me to use without getting that Gun thing and shooting myself in the foot. I do order this using the S & S option because between returning items...properly packaged, and sending things to others, I use about six rolls every six months. Amazon does not make many mistakes with its orders and I try not to change my mind about things all the time, so six rolls is quite sufficient for our family needs. It is small and simple to store. I have a little area in a drawer where I keep my batteries and small light bulbs. My packing tape and other types of tape all fit in the one big drawer. The tape holds boxes together well and gets the box where it is going. That should be about it. I buy the tape. I use the tape. It works well and performs as it says it will. It is priced optimally for my needs considering that it is delivered to my front door every six months. I am very pleased with this deal. Great tape that works just as it should.
Sign up and check it out for youself. If you are not happy with this, get one of those tape gun thingies and shoot yourself in YOUR foot. Seeeee.....Told you. YOU DO like this tape. I'm so glad you gave it a try. Ho Ho. I must be getting really tired. The tape is good and I hope you try it and like it. Have a good one shipping your trusty dusty packages held together with Scotch. Cindy O.",positive

266,Office Products,for women value pack with 1 razor and 4 razor blade r,$9.49 - $19.99,5,"I'm finishing up my college degree. I've studied mathematics teaching for the past 4 years. The amount of math homework I've done and lesson notes I've taken is extreme. I'm talking dozens of hours a week writing things by hand. As such, I've used just about every single notebook under the sun. I can say from experience this is one of the best I've ever used. The binding is wide and doesn't catch on the paper/come unwound. The pages have pretty good bleed resistance. The perforation is strong enough to avoid coming off here and there but easy enough to use. It's easily a 5-star notebook.

Now, I'm a pretty cheap guy, so I've never sprang for the primo stuff, but for the price this is a really solid spiral. It's 5 subject, but you're only getting 40 pages per subject which isn't much. The folders are a nice quality, but they are a bit thin. If you're intending to use this for multiple classes/subjects, you should probably get a different notebook for each. I would also say to be prepared that this notebook is wider than any other I've ever seen; only just fits in my bag. If you're taking a really really really hard class that requires a ton of by-hand homework, this is the way to go. For the math class I'm taking right now I'm turning in two 15-20 page homeworks per week and this thing can handle it.

I have printed something then tried to print something else immediately after that was done and it wouldn't connect until I went to reset the printer.

Helpful hint - go to the website and put in the exact model of your product( on the printer front, and make note of the serial number on the back) to find the driver for your model. for my addled brain it was a little challenging to follow the connection settings too. you must hold and releases two buttons on the printer - This took me several attempts as somehow it times out very quickly.

314,Office Products,Paper Mate Flair Felt Tip Pens,$13.13 - $53.27,2,"As an engineer, I grew quite fond of these pens over the years. I use them exclusively for redline drawings, note taking, and anything else that I would need to hand write and be able to read down the road. For some reason, these pens make my handwriting significantly neater. I mean, I actually enjoy writing with them. For years and years Paper Mate pens, with the two hearts on the cap, were my go-to pen. They were American made, never leaked, and would last for years. I still have some of my old ones, and they still work. I'm rambling, I know, but I wanted to give a little background.

A few months ago, I went to the supply cabinet at my office to grab a couple of my trusty paper mates. I popped open the box (not a whole lot of people go for the felt tip pens, so I usually open them up) and was very very surprised by what was inside. For as long as I've been around, paper mate pens were glossy colored, smooth, and had half millimeter lines that ran parallel to the shaft of the pen. I used to put my thumbnail in the grooves and spin the pen to make a ""ZZZZIPPP"" noise. These new pens though... they were not right. They're matte in color, the shaft is bare, with a very cheap quality screen print ""Paper Mate"" marking on it. I would bet my paycheck that the factory in Mexico where these pens now come from, make pens for 100 different companies. I'm sure they're all the same pen, with the only difference being the screenprinted name on each pen. My old paper mates had a white tip guard, with just the colored tip sticking out about a millimeter. These pens now have a clear tip guard and the tip sticks out about twice as far. I know, big deal right? Well, yes, it is a big deal. Now, if you press too hard, the tip will deform, and the pen will be useless.

So, having discovered these new style paper mate pens, I had to know if they were all this poorer quality. I came to Amazon and ordered 2 boxes of black, 2 boxes of green, and 2 of these multi-color packs. Yes, every single one of them was this cheap knock-off pen. I did a side by side comparison with my old green pen and a new one. The new ink is significantly lighter. All of the colors seem to get much lighter after the ink dries. The caps are much lower quality, as would be expected.

The pens themselves are not terrible, but compared to the old Flairs, they are complete garbage. It's unfortunate that companies are still sacrificing quality and customer satisfaction, all in the name of our hyper-inflated dollar.

In the face of the United State's current economic crisis, and the obvious need for American manufacturing, it is shameful of Paper mate's parent company to kill even more jobs and pass this low quality product off on the consumers. With the economy the way it is, consumers now want more bang for their buck. NewellRubbermaid is the company that now owns Paper Mate, so it is no surprise that they would move manufacturing to foreign soil. They have ruined the name of a fantastic American company by sacrificing quality and integrity for an easy buck, the same as they did with the original Rubbermaid containers.

I apologize for the long winded review, but here's what I think in a nutshell. These pens are okay for what they are. They should NOT be called paper mate flairs. If these pens were XYZ Corporation Felt Tip Pens, they would be a fantastic product. At over $1 per pen though, these are absolutely NOT worth it. You pay a premium for Paper Mate pens, because they WERE premium pens. NewellRubbermaid thinks they can fool us and charge more for cheap, low quality knock-off products. Show them we are smarter than that. Avoid these if you can, if not for quality, then for principal.",negative

320,Office Products,Amazon Basics Cross-Cut Paper and Credit Card Shredder,$31.89 - $154.91,5,"Have had this Amazon Basics15 Sheet Cross-Cut shredder for over a year with no problems. I use a ""Tall Kitchen"" .9 mil trash bag in the bin (approx. 27""Lx24""W) to facilitate shredded paper removal - wrap the upper part of the bag over the bin top surround. The bag shows when bin is closed, but makes bin emptying easier. To ensure a long lifespan, I only shred 8 or less pieces of normal thickness paper at a time, with about 5-10 seconds between shreds. Using this technique, I can shred a 5-6"" stack of bank statements (no envelopes) in about 30-45 minutes with no overheat.

The safety features (bin full / bin not fully closed) work properly; have never had overheat indication using my technique.

NOTE 1: When you see the ""Bin Full"" indication (i.e. normally the case when you insert paper into the slot and shredder does not start), you can partially pull out the bin and tamp down the shredded paper to increase bin capacity. However, if the bin is nearly full and you can only shred a few times before the ""Bin Full"" indication reappears, it's time to completely empty the bin to prevent serious jamming.

NOTE 2: Periodic lubrication of the blades is vital for a long shredder life; opinions vary as to how often. Some say lubricate every time you empty the bin (assuming you don't tamp down the shredded paper multiple times). But most definitely with frequent jams requiring ""Reverse"", lack of lubrication may be the problem. I purchased a transparent 8oz squeeze bottle (approx 5.5""Lx2""W) with a twist open/close nozzle, and filled it with grocery store canola oil (i.e. research indicated comparable to name brand shredder oil). With the nozzle open, bottle inverted, and normal squeeze pressure, insert oil into the paper slot (i.e. moving the inverted bottle from left-to-right in about 4-5 seconds). Then immediately place the On-Off control slider into the Reverse position for about 5 seconds. Now run a couple sheets of paper through to distribute lubricant over the blades.",positive
321,Office Products,Amazon Basics Cross-Cut Paper and Credit Card Shredder,$31.89 - $154.91,5,"I'm shredding A LOT of estate documents and this unit is holding up well. I find it is less prone to overheating if multiple sheets are shred at once. For a stack of 50 papers, I shred 2 or 3 at a time in/of just one as shredding a lot of sheets, one at a time is more likely to cause overheating than shredding a few at a time. Listen to the unit. If the motor sounds like it is straining shred fewer sheets at a time. If the unit overheats the unit will become hot to the touch near the vents. If it does overheat a red LED will glow and the unit will stop running. If this happens let it rest for 30 minutes then start again.

So yes, I am happy with this unit.",positive
322,Office Products,Amazon Basics Cross-Cut Paper and Credit Card Shredder,$31.89 - $154.91,4,"works well, takes several pages at a time, very compact footprint, and for the price, it's just perfect for our occasional shredding needs. leaves long-ish strips that might not be the most super secure, but i'm not paranoid enough to think that someone is sitting around trying to reassemble the papers from our recycling bin. my only gripe is that it did fail to shred 2 laminated insurance cards - when i bought it, i did all of my old cards first, so i could dump them separately from the paper recycling - and so i noticed, that while it did just fine with all the hard plastic credit cards, the two flimsier laminated insurance cards were mostly intact, just with several cut lines through the paper, where the laminate remained intact, so the cards were still perfectly easy to read (if not entirely presentable). so, in the future, i will be double-checking the bin after shredding any card, just to make sure that it is sufficiently destroyed. still very much worth the price, and i'm happy i bought it.",positive
323,Office Products,Amazon Basics Cross-Cut Paper and Credit Card Shredder,$31.89 - $154.91,4,"This is my second one of this type. The first one was a crosscut that made tiny confetti cuts.

Also, once you turn it on it runs until you shut it off so you don't have to keep finding the sensor to make it start shredding. Amazon surprised me by the quick delivery, I ordered on the 13th and it was delivered today on the 15th. I am guessing it is because I live about a mile from the Amazon warehouse. I am also amazed that they are so on point with deliveries considering all the problems with logistics, I have had some nightmares with other companies.

324,Office Products,Amazon Basics Cross-Cut Paper and Credit Card Shredder,$31.89 - $154.91,5,"Shredder appears to be built to last, and upon further investigation, the shredder mechanism itself is actually made by Intertek, which is a well known brand. Using the shredder for the first time, I was able to shred 8 sheets of paper as advertised. Just note that the amount of sheets that are you are able to shred at a time is dependent upon the thickness of the paper. After running the shredder for about 30 minutes, I managed to jam a few sheets in the blades. After letting the shredder cool down for 30 minutes, I was able to remove the jammed sheets of paper without much issue. I have shredded several hundred sheets of paper with this shredder, and have never had any problems. I occasionally oil the shredder blades with mineral oil, as suggested by other reviewers. In my opinion, it's a very good shredder for the price.",positive

On occasion that shredder would heat and stop, so I decided it was time to purchase a new one. I bought this shredder, in the hopes that it would hold up a bit longer before the inevitable overheating. It really didn’t. However, it does perform quite well, shreds maybe five sheets at a time and was quite reasonably priced. I feel it was a good purchase. My old shredder, which was quite capable, went to the kids. I want to make it clear, this is a better shredder, the price is quite reasonable at 32 bucks, and it does everything it is supposed to do.

326,Office Products,Amazon Basics Cross-Cut Paper and Credit Card Shredder,$31.89 - $154.91,4,"For the most part, this is a very adequate shredder for the money. It shreds paper well and doesn't jam when feeding as many as 10 sheets of paper simultaneously through the shredder. It is easily maneuverable, which is a really nice feature. It is a bit more noisy than I anticipated but isn't really annoying. By the way, I accidently tried to feed a small piece of paper through the credit card/CD slot. Trust me, that doesn't work at all. The paper jammed in the slot and required some additional effort to retrieve it. :-( The main reason I only gave it 4-Stars instead of 5-Stars is because of the collection bin. The collection bin doesn't fit quite right. The bin removal necessitates some additional maneuvering each time it is removed before it seats properly. It seems like that particular design feature isn't quite right. But to me, it isn't a reasonable justification to return it.

Ticondergo is a well-trusted brand. however, having them ship through Amazon was a pain in the butt! If you can find it in person, I would recommend that. It isn’t worth the hassle of expecting it to be delivered via UPS/Amazon. Plus, if the package is dropped or handled poorly, the lead inside will break. And the wasteful packaging - don’t get me started! One of my poorest experiences ordering on Amazon.

Original Review:
The pencils are poor quality. They are highly unusable because they don’t exist. However, they are nice though ergonomically, because they're as light as air! If you suffer from over-use syndrome these are the pencils for you!

I expected to have the pencils in time to be able to use them. I was happily surprised by the one day shipping and jumped on it but it did not matter because the pencils never arrived even though one day shipping was offered. The seller claimed that the pencils were delivered to a secure location…which is clearly back at the Amazon warehouse. I'm extremely disappointed in the poor service and deceit - if a company cannot deliver then they should not advertise it.

So I’m giving this one star because the pencils are literally non existent and false advertisement is annoying. They should mark this as zero pencils because that’s what you’ll get.

I can't recommend buying this product on Amazon and I recommend buying from a reputable brick and mortar store like Walmart or Target or 7-eleven.",positive

371,Office Products,"TICONDEROGA Pencils, Wood-Cased, Unsharpened, Graphite #2 HB Soft, Yellow",$2.99 - $41.94,5,"I can be pretty picky about my pencils. The problem with Dixon Ticonderogas is that they are made in China and Mexico and on Amazon you never know what you will get. To complicate things somewhat, I've seen incense-cedar wood used in both China and Mexico versions of the same pencil, as well as lesser quality non-aromatic basswood or other lower grade wood material that is not readily identifiable.

Also, Ticonderogas over time have changed their packaging graphics and they will no longer specify wood type on the box, anymore. They now use a generic phrase ""Premium Wood / Bois de la meilleure / Madera de primera calidad"" which gives absolutely no indication if the wood is cedar or not.

Of late, they have a stamp signifying ""100% American CEDAR WOOD sustainable forests"" and this designation will grace all boxes of pencils that are created out of incense-cedar (presumably!).

It seems that this stamp has started to show on their products manufactured starting 2016. You will see it on their colored erasable/checking pencils, Tri-Conderogas, and their standard issue Ticonderogas in the 12-pack cardboard box, 24-pack hang tab clear plastic boxes, 48-pack hang tab green cardboard boxes, and the 96-pack cello wrapped variety which is in actuality 8 of the 12-pack boxes packaged as a single 96 count unit.

They probably will start to use this designation on other products as well to make it easier to distinguish which of their products are incense-cedar wood and which are not.

UPDATE: They also have a new stamp in the form of a gold colored banner: ""Celebrating over 100 years of excellence"". AVOID those like the plague! You are buying the low-end Ticonderoga. The irony...that they would label their low-end garbage as ""excellence"".
Ticonderogas come in a higher grade and lower grade now. Look for the green-white CEDAR WOOD stamp if you want the high grade Ticonderoga.

The problem is that there are huge stocks of pre-2016 packaging and it is hard to tell what's inside unless you actually peek into the box and handle the pencil in person. Even then, some variety of Ticonderogas will have sloppy paint jobs that have paint dripped over the ends and make it difficult to see the wood grain or take a whiff which is an important hint as to what you are dealing with (cedar vs basswood). Of course this is not possible when buying on Amazon.

I've bought 96-pack Ticonderogas at the large wholesale membership stores before (Costco) that are of the Mexican origin, in the same cello wrapped individually boxed units per dozen, HOWEVER, they are ""not marked for individual sale"", meaning the bar codes and product code (i.e. 13882) are not imprinted on the individual boxes.

The 96-pack bought today (2/6/2016) here on Amazon are also of the Mexican variety, in the same cello wrapped individual boxed units per dozen, AND they are each marked for individual sale, replete with barcodes and product codes. This is an interesting distinction because there is a huge quality difference between the two, and this is the crux of this review:

- The Costco variety have a strong paint smell where the Amazon variety is nicely aromatic cedar.
- The Costco variety is NOT imprinted as 100% AMERICAN cedar wood, the Amazon variety has the imprint.
- The Costco variety is obviously not cedar wood, wood is a pasty white without visible woodgrain patterns
- The Costco variety had very poor paint jobs and the classic green foil lettering and logos are noticeably poorer quality
- There were more curved pencil ""bananas"" and off-centered leads in the Costco variety
- The Amazon variety had largely well centered leads with mostly straight barrels, and the ferrule yellow paint stripes were clean

This all means that if you are lucky and score a box of the cedar wood variety, you will have a great writing experience.

The Mexican Ticonderogas were generally thought to be superior to the Chinese versions, because the Ticonderogas made in China largely used basswood/non-cedar wood, had a smallish eraser head, and the leads were poorly centered, and the ferrules were poorly painted as well. A lot of technical problems seems to plaque the Chinese version, like leads falling out (poorly bonded lead), or broken leads, or not sharpening well to a point (poor quality wood to blame). However, my Costco experience illustrates that both factories, whether it be China or Mexico, produce higher grade Ticonderogas and clearly lower grade ones as well.

Interestingly, the latest batch of pencils that are hitting the shelves in big office retailers like Office Depot or Staples are of FANTASTIC quality and they are made in China versions, with well centered lead cores, incense-cedar wood barrels, sharply imprinted foil lettering, and ferrules that are printed very evenly with a bright yellow band, and erasers that are starting to grow to a size that almost rivals the Mexican counterparts. They are slightly darker in color and a very smooth, satin finish.

I hope that Dixon is starting to listen to the myriad of complaints about the inconsistencies of their Ticonderoga product line, and the latest developments in this venerable brand is surely encouraging that all is not falling on deaf ears. In fact, the latest batch that are made in China would indicate that they have made a major commitment to restoring the brand to its former glory!",positive

So I found this guy, some of the reviews mentioned that the edge of it was rather uncomfortable on the wrists, and I found it was the case for me as well.

No big deal though, PU is pretty easy to slice! Put your mat on the edge of your desk, angle a nice sharp knife or razor blade at a little bit of a tilt and slowly cut a wedge in the front of your desk mat. It takes just a few seconds and the result is a much more comfy mat to use with a tiny amount of time and effort needed. After I cut the mat, I used a small lighter to very briefly heat up the edge to get rid of the small remaining pieces that were sticking out like lose hairs, and to seal the edge of the PU. Be careful when doing this because PU can and will catch on fire, move the lighter across the edge quickly, you don't need to burn anything just heat it up. Overall I am pretty happy, included a picture of the edge of the mat after I cut it so you can see the little angle. It really does help!",positive

If sharpie wanted to improve the feel even more they could add a bend where it rests on the hand.

Of course they are gel so it takes like one second for the ink to dry, but after that it doesn’t smudge. If you do a sketch with pencil and line it with this pen, take a few seconds for it to dry.

Folks like me who fill two notebooks and comments in writing on hundreds of papers a week (literally no exaggeration, here!) I need a bit of an ergonomic boost. I will literally save a comfortable pen and swap out the ink manually. Not there with this pen, yet. But it's summer semester. We'll see in the fall. Otherwise, it's a good buy. I am an an extremist on the user scale so that is a plus and a minus for the poor manufacturer I review in these matters. Heck...UL probably doesn't test pens like I do.

""SPECIAL, you are one in a million"", but that doesn't bother me. I was concerned about the side pockets being to small, but they fit a lot more than you would think. Even if you shake it around the pens not in the straps don't move into the other compartment. The zippers don't get stuck easily. It seems portable and the strap on the side seems sturdy.
