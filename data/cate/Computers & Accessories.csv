0,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Black",$129.99,4,"This is my third Amazon tablet. I own the the original 8 HD, the next generation, and now the latest. Obviously if you love the Amazon environment as I do, you can't go wrong with this tablet. I never ventured into the Apple world simply because I couldn't afford it on a teacher's salary and because I was already invested in Prime.

All of my tablets continue to function without any issues. The 8HD is beginning to show its age because the operation system can't update to the latest and greatest due to hardware issues. But it still will be grabbed for reading and listening to music.

Durable. That is what I would call these tablets. If I was going to use the tablets for other than recreational use, I would be looking for.something else. But as it is, the tablets do what I want them to do at a price point that keeps.me happy.

There are a couple.of issues that have been consistent across the three versions I own. The first is that the battery life has been ,""meh, "". All models promoted themselves as having really decent battery life. That was true when new. All three seemed to begin losing battery life within the first 6-10 months of usage. I am very careful with my charging protocol, making sure I don't just leave them on charge overnight like some people do.

Nowever, with three tablets, I always have one fully charged and ready to go.

The second issue I have with the Amazon tablets is the placement of the volume and power buttons. You would think Amazon could afford some decent investigation into now people.actually handle the tablet when using it. This latest version has been the absolute most annoying. When holding it in my hands, I frequently find I've accidentally changed the volume or turned the tablet off. The 8HD's buttons were recessed enough I never had this problem. But the later versions of the tablet all have the buttons sticking out farther from the case making them easier to locate but also.easier to accidently hit. And, whoever thought the on/off button should be directly under the volume button should never be allowed in a product design studio again.

A minor complaint is the spellchecker. Absolutely the worst I've ever seen. If you don't mind random periods and single words changed into two that don't make sense, like 'because' being change into 'be wise' (Huh?), then this probably won't bother you. Also if your high school English teacher drilled poofreading into your mindset, you should find this spellchecker subroutine an extension of heaven!

All in all, I would give these Amazon tablets a solid 4.5 out of 5 stars for the price point, durability, and ease of use in the Amazon environment. If you're looking for a tablet more for its entertainment value , you can't beat one of these.",positive
1,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Black",$129.99,4,"Ok, so I’ve been an Apple products user for cell phones and tablets since iPhone2. Figured it wise to disclose this up front. I’m not adept at all android os devices yet, but learning on the fire tablet has been decently intuitive and relatively easy. For the past 8 years, I’ve used an Apple iPad Air 2013 model that I got refurbished in 2014. It was always a crisp screen view and has held up since I bought the one with the most memory available. This Spring (2022), I noticed that more and more apps were not opening because the outdated OS no longer supported those apps. I kept using the iPad since streaming services were still working. That ended in June 2022–suddenly several of the streaming apps I regularly used stopped opening. I really didn’t want to spend upwards of $1,000 on a new or recently used iPad, so I looked into this recent model Fire tablet. This has been a good alternative so far! The screen resolution while streaming is good. The Home Screen resolution isn’t nearly as crisp as my old iPad was, but I got this Fire tablet on Prime Day for well under $100 (so freaking solid quality nonetheless given how much money I saved). Setting the Fire up was pretty easy, and I’ve been using the kindle feature on it far more than I ever used on my iPhone. I liked how the screen can be personalized, and have generally enjoyed this Fire for the few weeks I had it so far. The only real pain in the @$$ though is despite extending the screen sleep timer to 10+ minutes this thing routinely auto dims or sends its screen into sleep mode frequently while I am actively using it! It’s really annoying, because I can’t just hit a home button to awaken it—I typically have to close the magnetic cover & reopen it. I’m getting used to the exercise, but it’s sure noisome! Maybe this a user error issue?! I’m a bit ignorant on this point and my lack of experience with Fire tablets must be acknowledged. That said, it’s why I knocked off a star. I’ll try to update this review in the future once I’ve better familiarized myself with the OS and researched some online troubleshooting remedy discussions.",positive
2,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Black",$129.99,4,"This first happened, for me, when I innocently closed my first Kindle in the car door. Oh, sure. There were hurtful rumors that it jumped, but I still insist it was an accident.

Anyway, the replacement did away with the keyboard, and installed an infuriating pop-up version on which I am forever making typos.This was presumably to increase the screen size. More importantly, they removed the earphone jack. As I spent a fair amount of time listening to the electronic voice reading, while did something else....big issue.

Now we come to my decision to upgrade my smaller Fire tablet to a bigger screen. Being that I put thing off at a Professional level, my wife ended up getting me this as an early birthday present. I encountered yet another 'dump': I can only listen to a book if I own the Audible version. Which means, in essence, about 20 titles, most of which are books I wrote and released through ACX. Since you would literally have to beat me into submission to abandon a ton of better books to listen those...well, you get the general idea. I have probably 900 books that I can't audible skim through while working crosswords or balancing the national debt. So, okay, that latter bit is just an excuse I give my wife, and I suspect she's starting to catch onto the fact.

ANYWHOO...

I'm keeping the smaller Fire to essentially replace my Kindle, but this is a HUGE omission for me. Would it have taken up that much memory to leave the auto-read feature in place?????????

Good tablet, bad decision.",positive
3,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Black",$129.99,5,"I bought this because I wanted to give my wife a Kindle and I planned on giving her this one. She doesn't like reading on tablets, so I am using it. The screen is easy to see and read on even with cataracts. It's not an iPad, and hopefully it's not made with slave labor, like the iPod. It does everything I want and does it well, so I am very pleased with it. It's much faster than the previous version. I know because I went back to it after finishing a book on my new one and the load time of a book that was already downloaded to it was about the same as the wait to download and open a book on the new. Watching video is a pleasure, the color depth is excellent and the CPU on this version is fast enough that the WIFI is the limiting factor on how video is displayed. we watched ""Tombstone"" on the laptop and there was no buffering. Something that my previous Kindles couldn't claim!
The only issue I have with it is it wants to work in landscape mode, not portrait, which is the easiest way to read a page.",positive
4,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Black",$129.99,5,"tl;dr up front -- This is an excellent tablet! I would certainly purchase it again. (I paid $75)

I primarily use tablets for streaming purposes, audio and video. This device does both very well.
My primary apps:
iHeart Radio
Peacock
ESPN
xfinity Stream (companion app for Cable TV)
Amazon Prime
Amazon Prime Music
Spotify

All of those apps work well. Video quality is equal to an iPad (yes I also have one of those).
iHeart Radio has a problem with streaming one particular radio station on this tablet, but I suspect it is not primarily a Fire problem.

I typically use bluetooth headphones, but the built-in speakers work well when I need them.

Battery life is multiple days for me. I typically run the battery down to 10% then charge up to 90%. (it helps having another tablet available)

Of note -- fast charging via USB-C works fine with this tablet.

Of note 2 -- no YouTube app, but! You can download an 'app' (on-screen button) that just opens youtube.com, which works just fine.

Occasional minor problems with touching the right spot on the screen for some menu options -- but I suspect my fat fingers are the problem more than the device.",positive
5,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Black",$129.99,5,"I have over the years tried many tablets, from generic to ipad. When my ipad mini was about 2 years old it was no longer able to be updated. That was unacceptable to me, considering the cost of ipad and that it was only 2 years old and being made obsolete by apple, so I tried my first kindle fire. My first one was an 8 in version. I found that it was able to do all I wanted and more. After having it for a period, I gave it to a friend and then bought my first 10 in hd Fire tablet. For my work, I was able to become 100% paperless with the use of the tablet and my computer. I recently bought my third, again a Fire HD 10 now the 11th generation, and again, I love it. Could not ask for better for the price.",positive
6,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Black",$129.99,5,"This works well and does the basics. We bought 2. It is extremely reasonably priced. When family comes over to our camp site in the summer we can give them to the kids or drunk adults :) and not worry about them (we have a kid friendly cases with handle). They can stream from all the streaming apps, search the internet, check email, play games. We do have iPads, which are definitely more expensive. iPads are faster and there are some apps you can get through Apple and you can't get through Amazon. We have Direct TV Stream and couldn't get it through the Amazon app store but that is the only one I found so far. What I do like is Alexa, iPads do not have that, we hook the Fire Tablet to a Bluetooth speaker and pass the tablet around and people can just ask Alexa to play what they want on Spotify. No one has to press buttons, just talk to the tablet. And if something happens to the tablet we aren't out a lot of $$. So far they have taken a lot of falls and the tablets have held up well. I would recommend these if you need it for basic web surfing, emails, use it as a mini tv, or play music games with big people drinks :) Picture quality is good. May want to use a Bluetooth speaker to it so it is louder. Battery life is good.",positive
7,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Black",$129.99,4,"All in all, I am satisfied. Initially, I wanted only a reader, but found out the Kindle readers' memories are not expandable; the tablets are with a separately bought card. Having an e-library of over 7200 books & documents, I wanted a unit where as many items as possible could be downloaded & then accessed without wifi; as best as I can tell, this is doable. What I find most aggravating is the over riding Alexa, as well as some other settings like notifications. No matter how many times I check every possible setting for each app, Fire 10 (2021) repeatedly over rides. I don't use it for playing games, watching movies, or listening to music. I don't access any email or social media accounts, not even a calendar. As I said, I really only wanted a unit that could hold a lot of downloaded reading materials. There isn't the option to uninstall useless apps & the disable buttons are nonfunctional; the only viable option is to force stop. In the month of ownership, I've had to stop all of the Alexa apps & all notifications more than 4 times! I am unimpressed with its battery life. In a typical usage of 2 & 1/2 hours, the battery reduces 25%. The touch screen is not as sensitive to finger touch as it is to a stylus. I bought the Fire 10 on a Prime Day & am very glad about the $95 discount. Had I gotten it at full price, I doubt I would've put up with all of its aggravations.",positive
8,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Black",$129.99,5,"I'm a iPad/Mac user, but, for kindle book reading, I've used a dedicated Fire Tablet HD 8 that I've had for well over 2 years.

When this new model 10 inch Fire Tablet was reduced in price during the holidays in 2021, I decided it was time to make the jump to a larger screen (more (paper) book sized) and gain more battery ife per charge due to a larger battery.

This 10 incher did not disappoint at all. As a primary use for Kindle books, I'm getting 20 or more % battery life then the 12 hours the specs suggest this tablet can get.

The screen quality for reading is perfect. I typically set it to lower brightness (fixed) and there's no glare in the eyes nor any eye strain when using in a darkened bedroom at night.

The faster processor then my older 8 inch HD clearly adds some speed to anything you do on this tablet.

There's no lag at all in trying it for video, gaming, etc. As stated though, for me, I use a Fire Tablet primarily as a reader, period.

Screen resolution and contrast is excellent, certainly not any better ( and a little less) than my iPad PRO, but, of course we're talking a big difference in cost between tablets here and very different display technologies as well.

That said, this 10 inch HD Tablet is no slouch in offering a clear, sharp/detailed display with very sufficient color saturation and accuracy plus nice crisp text over-all.

Given Amazon offers just about any app needed for this fire Tablet, it certainly could be used for just about everything that an iPad could be and at a competitive price to the new basic model iPad model that sells in the $330+ dollar range now.

Some reviewers said due to where the camera is (oddly) located, one must use this Fire tablet in a case with the cover opening to the right rather then to the conventional left, but, not true. Since this tablet can flip screen orientation based on where the top of screen is located, I'm using a hard shell case for my Fire and the conventional left cover opening as normal. Granted the camera is at the bottom left corner in my configuration, but, that is no issue since if one needs to use the camera, they can orient the tablet however they wish and the screen (and camera) will orient as needed for photos.

The net here is you can use the tablet in a case and flip open the left cover as normal.

As an owner of both an iPad Mini and an iPad Pro 11 inch, I can say in all honesty, anyone wanting a tablet on a budget and hoping to get some decent performance and screen quality plus great battery life won't be disappointed at all in this new model 10 inch Fire Tablet.

I got the base 32 GB version with ads. Ads only show on the screen saver when opening up the sleep/wake cover and a one finger flip up of the screen goes back to where you left off or the home screen. Ads really are not a biggie in this context at all.

Given one can add a micro SD card to gain more storage space, and Micro SD cards are dirt cheap now, the 32GB version is fine for me.

No complaints at all and 5 stars all around for this Fire Tablet. A well designed tablet at a very good price.

I highly recommend it! If you order one, it'll be a definite ""keeper"".",positive
9,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Black",$129.99,5,"Just before Christmas in 2021, this item popped up on sale for just $75. We’re an apple family. We have numerous iPads in the house, plus our iPhones, Mac, MacBooks, Apple TV, etc. I’m an audio mixer, and use a product from Avid called the S1. It’s a control surface for Pro Tools that is meant to house a tablet for additional functionality- or eye candy. My older IPad worked, but looked tiny in the cradle, and wasn’t all that useable. I wanted something bigger, but didn’t want to spend the money on yet another iPad. For $75, I was willing to roll the dice.

It fits great, looks great, and does exactly what I bought it for.

But then I started to explore it deeper. It has built in Alexa with the wake word Amazon. As an audio engineer working from home, I sporadically have actors coming to record. I’ve got Ring doorbells at the entrances, and Echo devices in nearly every room. But for the first time, I can say “Amazon, show me the front door!”, and actually SEE it- and a lot faster than the Ring app on my phone would allow. This was a nice bonus. In fact, in my experience and opinion, Alexa works for much quicker and more reliably than Siri, that I’ve found myself relying on it a lot more. Having Alexa in the tablet to verbalize reminders, appointments, phone calls, etc- all right in front of me, is amazing!

I became fascinated with my new toy, and downloaded all the steaming media we subscribe to, plus other apps for news and weather that provide lots of content. I quickly found that I enjoyed watching tv on a 10 inch screen a lot more than on my iPhone. It’s nice to have lunch at the table with my kiddo and share a video we can both easily see and hear. So- this little guy has a great screen and works perfectly for watching shows, movies, YouTube, news, etc.

Now- I love my iPhone, and have my music library in iTunes. But when I purchase music, it’s always via Amazon. This is because I get my MP3 files instantly for most albums- but then have a physical disc arrive that often goes unopened. I just like know that HAVE the disc if I ever need to load it again or want to enjoy it in my stereo system. My iPhone can store a decent amount of music internally for when streaming isn’t an option. But I was floored to learn that the HD10 2021 has a micro SD card slot that can store up to 1 TB!!! That’s amazing to me. I can preload entire series, movies, music, photos- anything I need for a long trip or chilling in downtime. For like $25 I added a 400 gig card. Why iPads don’t have this is beyond me.

I work with and coach voice actors outside of my day job as a recording engineer. Having that much memory on a tablet and access to an app like WavePad, gives them the ability to record in a pinch while away from their studios. On-screen editing is also fun and easy. I actually added a nifty stylus and case to my HD10, along with a Bluetooth keyboard. It’s essentially a mobile studio, albeit limited.

While I haven’t experimented a ton with this- Silk browser (which seems to run on Chrome) allows me to use Source Connect Now to tap into actors or listen to sessions remotely at “CD quality”. Of course you can also use Zoom, Skype, etc.

As an apple user, I still want access to my ICloud apps, like Contacts, calendar, Pages, Keynote, Numbers, etc. You can log into your iCloud account and get it all. The trick is to choose “request desktop site”, otherwise you dead-end at “find my device”. You can even log into Apple Music via the browser. So all my apple stuff is still with me!

I chose Outlook email to run my various work and personal emails and have a unified calendar. It’s perfect for what I need.

For $75, I’m finding myself using it more than I have ever used my iPad. It’s the right screen size for me to actually be productive with it, while also having endless entertainment in reach. Add a case, keyboard and stylus- and you’re good to go!",positive
10,Computers & Accessories,SABRENT 4-Port USB 2.0 Data Hub with Individual LED lit Power Switches [Charging NOT Supported] for Mac & PC (HB-UMLS),$7.99,5,"Two of the three USB ports on my aging laptop no longer function.

A small non-powered USB hub is a perfect solution and this one fits the bill very well.

This Sabrent 4 port USB hub is well made and solid so should last a long time even though it did not cost a lot of money. It's a simple elegant design and does exactly what I need it to do. It was recognized by Windows 10 on my laptop with no issues and provides four USB ports. Since I only use it occasionally the cord length is fine for my use too. I don't really use or need the port switches but they do work and might be helpful for others.

It was the least expensive hub I could find at the time at under $10 and works well for what I needed, so I am very pleased with the purchase.

My original idea was to use it as a backup charger for my MacBook Air M1 (M1 2020) purchased last year, and possibly use it as a backup charger for my MacBook Pro 15"" (Mid 2014). To enable the latter, I included a ""Nylon Braided USB C to Magnetic Charging Cable Cord"" in my original order with the charger.

I expected that the charger would work with my MacBook Air M1, but was not sure about it working with my older MacBook Pro and it's MagSafe connector. For this function a good USB-C to MagSafe cable cord would be required. The cord I selected was a pink nylon braided cable by Yoamp, just short of 5 feet in length. Though it had few reviews, they were all positive, so I felt it was worth the risk. (Side note - I decided on pink so that it would be easy to identify and locate visually.)

As expected, the charger worked very well with my MacBook Air M1, recharging the laptop a little faster than the original Apple charger. Though I don't use this charger as much as the original charger, I've have no problems when I do use it. Also, the charger never seems to get more than warm; unlike other chargers that I've read about.

As for my MacBook Pro 15"", I found that connecting the Yoamp cord to this charger, and then my laptop didn't seem to work - at first. However, upon further inspection, I realized that the USB-C connector needed to be pushed in a little more to created a ""click"" and solid connection with the charger. Once that was done everything seemed to work perfectly. In subsequent uses, the charger never seems to ""heat up"" though it will get slightly warm at times. Overall I'm extremely please with it in this function.

In conclusion, after 6 weeks of use, this charger has performed well in a dual purpose role. As a backup charger for my MacBook Air M1 it's close to a perfect choice. As a backup for my 2014 MacBook Pro 15"", I have no complaints so far. I will update this review if I discover any new characteristics or problems.",positive

honestly, the MSI cords that the company claims don't exist cost between 90-130$. Compared to this at 30$, its like trying to decide between a firm kick between the legs repeatedly until you die (and you pay 130$ for it) or a nice slice of caramel cheesecake, though a bit pricy at 30$. send me that cheeesecake baby and I am officially signing my endorsement for this bad boy. maybe you... buy it too?",positive

5* review for successfully resolved my low 2.4G speed problem, excellent support from TP Link and fast 5G speed that exceeds Verizon Fios max speed of 300Mbps.

The purpose of this review is to compare the 2.4G and 5G speeds of the TP Link Archer A7(AC1700) WiFi 5 router and AX21(AX1800) WiFi 6 router using an iPhone 11 which supports WiFi 6. The highest speed I can test is 300Mbps limited by my Verizon Internet plan. Measurement results using show that using the WiFi 5 router, the 2.4G speed is 60M/80M (UL/DL) and the 5G speed is 307M/330M, whereas using the WiFi 6 router, the 2.4G speed is 110M/120M and the 5G speed is about same.

Newer routers’ real life 5G speed is very high and normally is not a problem, but real life 2.4G speed could be slow. It is not entirely sure which part of the wireless link is limiting the 2.4G speed. Below examines the speed limit of the WiFi standards involved, the router and iPhone 11. The routers are TP Link’s Archer A7(AC1700) and AX21(AX1800). Measured speeds at 2.4G and 5G will also be given.

Router (TP Link) Specs and Supported WiFi Standards
1) Archer A7(AC1700) has has 3 antennas is a WiFi 5 router
2.4G : 450Mbps
5G: 1300M bps
Supported Standards: AX21(AX1800) : 802.11ac(Wi-Fi 5), 802.11b, 802.11ax(Wi-Fi 6), 802.11n(Wi-Fi 4), 802.11g

802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax are also called Wi-Fi 4, WiFi 5 and WiFi 6 respectively.

2) AX21(AX1800) has 4 antennas is a WiFi 6 router
2.4G: 574M bps
5G: 1200M bps.
Supported Standards: AX7 (AC1700) 802.11b, 802.11n, 802.11g, 802.11ac

A7 (AX1800) is a low cost ($60) popular (listed as “Amazon Choice”) WiFi 5 router which supports 802.11 ac whereas AX 21 is a low cost ($90) WiFi 6 router which supports 802.11 ax. WiFi 6 (max speed 9.6G) not only has higher speed than WiFi 5 (max speed 3.5G) but also can support more devices using orthogonal frequency division multiple access. The main differences are given in picture 1.
(Picture 1 from : https://www.mwrf.com/technologies/systems/article/21849959/whats-the-difference-between-wifi-5-and-wifi-6)

Comparing the specs of these two routers, one has a higher 2.4G speed while the other has a higher 5G speed. But in real life, according to my measurements, at 2.4G, the WiFi 6 router has almost twice the speed than the WiFi 5 router. I don’t have a high enough wireless speed plan to test the 5G speed. In my house both routers have the same speed of 310M, limited by the max speed allowed by Verizon Fios 300M.

Speeds specified by the WiFi standards are speeds the router manufacturers trying to meet and they are not the limit, but speeds advertised by the router are the speeds that customers want the router to be able to reach. They become upset if they are unable to get the speeds advertised by the router.

Routers often do not specified under what link conditions these seemingly advertised high speeds could be realized. For example what is the required bandwidth, the number of antennas (the so called MIMO) and how pure the signal has to be (the signal to noise ratio). Is the bandwidth 20, 40, 80 or 160M? Is the signal to noise ratio has to be greater than 10dB?

In real life, link speed depends on how far from the router (the signal strength) and radio interference which falls in band (the signal to noise ratio). The former can be solved by doing the speed test right next to the router, where the transmit signal from the router is at maximum. But for the latter, unless one has a so called Faraday Cage, there is no way to block in-band interference especially at 2.4G, which are used by microwave ovens, Bluetooth and many household devices. Interference is hard to quantify without using a spectrum analyzer and could become an excuse if one calls the router support line complaining low speed.

Another limit is the device itself, and in this case iPhone 11. It’s specs are given below.

Wi-Fi specifications for iPhone 11
802.11 standard, name, frequency Maximum PHY data rate Maximum channel bandwidth Maximum MCS index Maximum spatial streams
ax@5 GHz 1200 Mbps 80 MHz 11 (HE) 2/MIMO
ac@5 GHz 866 Mbps 80 MHz 9 (VHT) 2/MIMO
a/n@5 GHz 300 Mbps 40 MHz 7 (HT) 2/MIMO
ax@2.4 GHz 195 Mbps 20 MHz 9 (HE) 2/MIMO
b/g/n@2.4 GHz 144 Mbps 20 MHz 7 (HT) 2/MIMO
(From: https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/iphone-wi-fi-specification-details-dep268652e6c/web)

https://mcsindex.com gives more details about how the speed on each band is affected by modulation scheme, number of antennas, bandwidth and WiFi standards used, not only for iPhones but for routers as well.

From the iPhone 11 specs, only “n” and “ax” support 2.4GHz if we ignore the older standards “b” and “g”. At 2.4G, The maximum speeds for “n” is 144M whereas for “ax” is 195M. The max bandwidth for both is 20MHz which needs to be set in the router. Setting the bandwidth to 40MHz could lower the speed as the noise power will be doubled.

However, at 5GHz the speed for ac (WiFi 5) is 866M with 80M max bandwidth whereas for ax (WiFi 6) is 1200M also with 80M max bandwidth. These bandwidths should also be specified in the router. Setting the bandwidth too high or too low could lower the speed.

From the iPhone 11 max speeds, it is clear that the wireless link’s speed is not limited by both the A7 and AX21 routers and the standards, but by the iPhone 11 at 2.4G and by Verizon Fios at 5G.

I have Verizon Fios 300M download and upload. Initially, I used an A7, thinking that at 2.4GHz, the router speed is 450M which is higher than iPhone’s 144M(“n”) and 195M(“ax), surely shouldn’t be a problem. But speed test showed that I got only 60M download and 80M upload from the best channel and 20M bandwidth (I tested all the channels and bandwidth combinations).

60M is too slow for me because I have several devices (such as security cameras) using 2.4G. So I called TP Link support line to see what I had done wrong. Most customer supports didn’t know what the problem was the and finally I was connected to a high level support. She said that in real life, I had to multiply the speed by 30-50% and guided me through the various specs of the wireless link. I don’t know where the 30-50% comes from, perhaps it was her empirical experience. If I use the average of 40% and assume that applies to the lower speed of the router and the iPhone, which is 144MHz. 40%x144M is 57M. This was about what I got at 2.4G using the A7 router.

But she also said something about WiFi 6 router and got me thinking perhaps a WiFi 6 router could improve the speed. (I must say that I got excellent support from TP Link, I had gotten calls twice from the specialist unsolicited and many followup emails. All trying to help me solve the low speed problem.)

I then change the A7(AC1700) to an AX21(AX1800), which does support WiFi 6 “ax”.

The main advantage of using AX21 is that it raised the iPhone 11 max speed at 2.4G from 144M to 195M, a gain of 51M. And as a result, in real life, the 2.4G link speed seemed to have increased by about the same amount. Speed test showed that at 2.4G, I now got ~90-110M(download, previously 60M when using A7) and 100-120M(upload) with the channel and bandwidth set on auto. Though the download speed is still less than 195M, the link speed has increased by changing to a router that supports ax and has 4 antennas. Have no idea if a more expensive router will further increase the 2.4G speed.

However, at 5GHz, both routers give 307M download and 330M upload, limited by Verizon Fios max speed of 300M.

When doing speed test, I shut off all 2.4G emitters. I live in a rural area and I suspect there is little interference.

A7 has 3 antennas whereas AX21 has four. Is the speed improvement at 2.4G due to the additional antenna or the support of WiFi 6 or both?",positive

I had a 10 year old Archer C7 router that I wanted to replace with a new C7. I had a problem understanding the installation video so I contacted customer service to try to understand if there was a problem. I did a chat with customer service and then they sent me an e mail. I had further questions and my e mails were answered within hours. I did not exactly get an answer to my question, but that may be because I didn't know enough terminology to frame it correctly. I was trying to find out what they meant in the instructions that said do not connect router to modem if there is another network on modem. My internet provider refers to the setting where I connect to the internet as a part of their network. So I was trying to find out if that connection to the modem was something I should worry about.
I finally got an e mail saying that I should make sure that no other devices were connected to the modem. It took a while, but they kept trying. I was able to set up the router and used the quick setup guide at the
TPLink web site. One problem I had was that the instructions and the web site did not really stress enough the need to go to the network setting of your internet provider, and connect to the internet there. ;
On windows eleven the network settings are hidden, and when you click on the internet connection icon on the lower right hand part of the screen you don't see the various settings. By settings I mean the place where you enter your router password and connect to your internet service provider. In earlier windows the setting appeared when you clicked on the internet icon. Now you have to hit a > icon on the menu to find the internet connections. The internet connection for the C7 is TP-Link_90C2. Once you connect there you have a seciure internet connection. My problem was that after I ran the quick install I got a message you can now use the internet, and I was connected to the internet. However it was not a stable connection, and I lost it twice before I figured out that I needed to go to the windows 11 icon and then to my internet providers connection to get a stable connection.
I rate customer service very high for quickness of response and patience with new user in trying to help me understand the product. I rate the instructions as not so great. I rate my ability to read the instructions as poor. Maybe they pointed out the need for the internet connection on windows 11, but it wasn't in big enough print or underlined enough for me to get it.
The product is also very good once I got it set up. I am getting more speed than my internet provider says it is providing me. Maybe some of my neighbors mgh is coming into my apartment. I am still getting a slight bit of buffering in loading some web sites, but I don't think this is a router problem. I don't know because I cant use wifi analyzer with my c7. There is no way to pick your channels, you have to hope that the C7 does it correctly. Customer service patiently explained to me that I should relax, big brother router was going to solve it. Maybe so, but I still get some buffering. HOwever it is just on a few sites, and for a few seconds so i can live with it. Overall, i give the whole experience five stars, but the interface was a little confusing or maybe it was the instructions I should give four stars.",positive
32,Computers & Accessories,"TP-Link AC1750 Smart WiFi Router (Archer A7) -Dual Band Gigabit Wireless Internet Router for Home, Works with Alexa, VPN Server, Parental Control, QoS",$53.99,5,"I have a pretty extensive home network at my house. In the past I've used predominantly Cisco/Linksys or Netgear devices. Lately however, I have stop using Linksys devices because their reliability is not what it used to be. This router is replacing a two year old Linksys router. Routers utilize solid-state circuitry and shouldn’t be failing as often as they do.

Netgear router‘s seem to be reliable although my reason for not using Netgear is due to their awful firmware. I had a pair of Netgear nighthawk router’s set up in my house. Those routers were purchased because they supported OpenDNS which allows you to have very reliable and easy to configure content filtering for children and for advertisements. Despite the fact that the router Is advertised as supporting OpenDNS, Netgear pushed out an update which rendered OpenDNS unusable. Netgear partnered with Disney and are forcing you to use the absolutely awful and practically useless Disney circle content filtering for children. Not only does it not work and ends up filtering just about everything, rendering the computer useless, but there’s no way to turn it off and return to using OpenDNS.

I called tech-support about it and not only did they not even understand the terminology that I was using while discussing the problems with the router, but they were truly slow and stupid. For a simple question, it would take them five minutes to look up an answer when anybody with a grade C in high school computer science should be able to answer those questions.

They were idiots and I was stuck with a router that I purchased for a specific advertised function which they removed less than two months after I purchased the hundred dollar router brand new. That’s pretty pathetic and I won’t support Netgear any longer due to their unfair business practices. On The front and rear of my house, I employ two TP-Link WNR841N routers. They were only $20 when I bought them about five years ago. These two routers cover my front yard and my backyard for when I have guests over or am doing yard work.

These inexpensive routers have been running for all of this time, protected only by old candy boxes which I painted and sealed for exterior use. That being said, these two TP-Link router‘s have been outside in the weather at temperatures as high as 103 in the summer and as low as 15° below zero. They have never failed once. I never have to reboot them [although the firmware has an option to schedule automatic reboots which I do once per week to refresh DNS and NetBIOS entries], I never have to do any updates on them, and so far I’ve never had to replace them.

Over the last six or seven years I have been purchasing almost nothing but TP-Link router‘s for people that ask me to help them with their network or computers. I have never gotten any complaints from anybody about their router, and the oldest one that I bought is about seven years old and it still works, although I’m not using it anymore because my two main routers need to support 802.11 AC. This is the second router of this model which I purchased. The first one was purchased for a friend of mine who had problems at his house with a D-Link router that stopped working after just over a year. That was about a year ago so far and he's never called about it. No news is good news; I assure you.

I bought this to replace my Netgear Nighthawk which I mentioned earlier. I installed it about two weeks ago and so far have not had a single issue with it. The interface is very fast and the WiFi signal is very reliable. The way they laid out the GUI Is nice but the menu on the left has a pretty big flaw.

The menu on the left employs a collapsible menu design which extends past the bottom of the screen if you open any of the menus, rendering the other options impossible to see or interact with. There is a scroll bar for you to use but the scroll bar is tiny and automatically disappears into the background so you don’t even know there’s a scroll bar there. TP-Link should re-think the menu design. I would also like to see them allow you to save changes per page without restarting the router. I experienced some minor inconvenience while setting up my router because on a couple of occasions I wanted to make multiple changes to the settings before rebooting the router and enabling those changes, however the router doesn’t provide a method for you to save changes without rebooting right away.

Despite the couple of firmware design mistakes, I am quite satisfied with this router and would definitely buy again. It's undoubtedly going to be an even better (damn near perfect, probably) certainly be more satisfied after I install open WRT on it. I will continue to be a TP Link customer for as long as they keep their prices low and quality at or above where it is now.",positive

It worked like a charm just that I only wished I'd get more coverage but that could be solved with an extender OR going the Moca route which I did and was still good.

Come around to August of 2022, I got 1gig Fiber installed by TDS and was still using this router and noticed a big bottleneck through the ethernet ports (Limited to around 360 down/up). I thought I was going to get 1 gig through because of the ethernet ports being able to support 1 gig but even though it may be able to support 1 gig on the ethernet ports it does not have the capability to output close to 1 gig. Therefore I just turned it into an access point for upstairs to get more coverage and bought a new router that was able to output almost 1 gig via ethernet.

Overall it ran its course and I would say that it did its job, just kind of wished that there was more information bolded/highlighted of what it could output.",positive

In a smaller home, it is more than adequate. The 2.4GH signal is really only for older legacy electronics. It is slow compared to the 5GH band.
I love the TP-Link firmware. It is a very feature rich, well organized GUI. I also truly appreciate the continued updates, two already this year, and the ease of downloading and installing within the GUI.

I was reluctant to replace my 15 yr old Linksys router, but it finally stopped working. I really didn't care that my internet speeds were slowed down by the old router. It didn't drop the internet often, when it did, I just unplugged it and plugged it back in & was almost instantly back online. Plus the Geek Squad set it up for me. During the 15 yrs, I unsuccessfully tried to setup another router & was intimidated by the experience. This time I had no choice.

My experience setting up the Archer A7 was not a good one...however, a couple weeks later after much frustration, I realized all the problems I experienced were user errors.

What I did that I shouldn't have done:
--My first mistake was using the 15 yr old ethernet cable. I figured it worked for the Linksys it should be good. After a week of the most unstable, frustrating wireless experience ever...it sometimes dropped every few minutes, I finally decided to try a new Ethernet cable. I didn't use the short one that came with the Archer, I had a long one that I could attach to my laptop. In case the wireless was still dropping, I wanted to wire my laptop to the modem. Well, the new ethernet cable made a difference for about 24 hours, then wireless started dropping again. Boy, was I upset and frustrated!!! Plus, my HP LaserJet Pro wouldn't print wirelessly. geesh...was I upset.
--My 2nd mistake was using the 15 yr old adapter. All the old cables, and cords on the modem and old router were/are short. It was difficult to even pick the modem up to attach/detach anything which is why I used the old adapter which was plugged into an extremely hard to reach outlet. After another week of absolutely, insane frustration and hours of research, I finally used the adapter that came with the Archer...and yes the cord is even shorter than the old adapter cord, but finally wireless stopped dropping and actually hasn't dropped since.
The only remaining problem was getting my HP LaserJet to print wirelessly.

---Lesson learned...when it's suggested to use new cables, etc. I need to follow that advice. I was so ready to rent a router from our cable company, Spectrum, but kept putting off calling them.

----Today, I finally got the LaserJet to print wirelessly. At the beginning of this mess (that I pretty much created myself) I had to reinstall the printer driver which I did during the time the wireless kept dropping. I didn't & still don't have time to spend researching all the errors I was experiencing, but finally realized I needed to reinstall the printer driver again. This time the instructions I followed were a bit different and a few steps had different results which made more sense. The 2nd reinstall solved the problem. My LaserJet is finally printing wirelessly again.

Actually I don't have a lot of experience with all this stuff, but have spent time through my years of using computers that I kind of learned my way around. I used the internet extensively to search for answers and understand terms that were new to me.

Because I have so many wireless devices setup, I didn't want to have to set them up again so I used my old network name and password.
With the new Archer A7, I am finally getting the internet speed I've been paying for and so far, haven't had a drop since I used a new ethernet cable and the included adapter.",positive

UPDATED REVIEW : 28 August 2022

Regret.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but definitely once you hit its limitations.

TLDR : Child can never have their own Amazon account without credit card information and proof of residence in THEIR name. So you can never buy apps on their own account for later use. Apps are non-transferable. #Regret

My kiddo has a Furby Connect toy, the app will not work in kids mode as it requires location services to be active. There is no override for this. Other apps we wanted to install were also complaining. We were also wanting to purchase apps which would have a longer lifespan and any in-app purchases on the actual child account will be lost as they age and obtain their own account anyway.

Other issues with the kids mode, the tablet grows considerably slower with time, adding in an SD card still triggers an error about the tablet being full even though there is room, you just have to say ok and try to ""ignore"" it.

So, easy fix right?
Set up an account for the child, load account with gift card, for the games which that were played the most on Kids+ - purchase those apps on the new account, lock everything down with an external app such as Kaspersky Kids.

Step 1. Create Gmail account purely for use on tablet

Step 2. Factory Reset tablet to set up with single ""adult"" account

Step 3. Create Amazon account for child

Step 4. Spend considerable time and effort setting up tablet with already purchased apps from Google Play and other free apps from the Amazon App store.

Step 5. Lastly, add Credit card for purchases on Amazon account.
Purchase first app on tablet.
Amazon Account locked.

Unusual activity detected on account.
Please wait 24H for someone to be in contact.
Wut ?

Tablet is completely inaccessible.

Right ok so ...

Step 4. Factory reset....

Step 5. Make another account for child.

Step 6. Spend the rest of the day setting up the account.

Step 7. Buy $25 gift card for new account with your own Amazon account

Step 8. Redeem $25 gift code on account for tablet

Step 9. Things seem to be working fine. Child asks for one more app she used to enjoy.
Try to add app.

Step 9. Account locked.

Unusual activity detected on account.
Please wait 24H for someone to be in contact.

.... wa wa wa.

Step 10. Contact Amazon Support.

- Be transferred to Kindle Support

- Beg and Please for Amazon to unlock tablet account for child.
-- Support person asks if I had already redeemed the voucher

// About to answer ""Yes""
// Browser update force closes browser, minor cursing.

- Resume chat (Thank a higher power for that)
-- Assigned new kindle support person.

- New support person claims to read chat.

The new support person wasn't even understanding my problem, I needed the account unlocked and they started to talk me through doing a factory reset.

At this point I lost my cool.

Expletives were expressed.

Tagged out and other half tags in.

Chat goes around in circles whilst Amazon requests that we send in Proof of Address and Credit Card information for the account holder and the explanation of ""Child is 4 and does not have a credit card, or actual proof of address for that matter, we are the parents, why can we not just enter our card information?""

We are told to submit the information and wait 24H.

Obviously my child does not own a credit card or receive any bills in their name and therefore this becomes an unsolvable paradox. I am now sitting with a locked account I can't unlock and a redeemed $25 gift card redeemed on that account as well. This is nothing short of BLATANT THEFT.

Step .......
OMG. Don't do it, just don't.

We went the very next day and purchased an Samsung A7 Lite instead.
Huawei would have been the better choice due to Samsung's bloatware, but thanks to their fragile stance with the Google Play store, they are best left alone for now.

PREVIOUS REVIEW : June 13, 2021
------------------------
Amazing -- Provided You Have No Interest In Previous In-App Purchases

It's amazing! So what's to dislike?

Well not much tbh, but I've mentioned two reasons below, so you can decide for yourselves whether or not this would be a deal breaker for you.

TLDR;
CONS
#1 -- No extension option on lock
#2 -- No support of previous in-app purchases

PROS
#1 -- Interface that adjusts to age range
#2 -- Full parental control and remote access to tablet through Amazon account
#3 -- Year free of Kids+
#4 -- Very responsive and durable
#5 -- Support for shared apps such as Netflix and Plex

-------------------

#1
One obvious missing features (for me anyway), is an ""extension"" button.
There was an option for that on the leap pad epic when it locked, where you could extend the time for a set window, be it 15 or 30 minutes. Seriously how often does your child ask, ""Just 15 more minutes"". This would be a seriously useful feature and I can't believe it isn't here.

To extend the time, you actually need to change the time when the device will lock on a general basis, which is covered by only two tabs, weekdays and weekends. Also, Friday night is not counted as part of the weekend, so even if you set the device to lock a little later on weekends, be advised that you'll be in for a fight on Sunday night.

Thing is, once I change the time to say 6:15pm, to allow for that extra ""15 minutes"", I then have to remember to change it back before the following night as otherwise it will only lock at 6:15pm and adding on an extra begged-for 15 minutes would then be 6:30pm. The child obviously won't understand this mistake and you end up in a loop of doom. Just unnecessary admin really.

You can however adjust this remotely within your Amazon account itself and I have pulled this off before when I've remembered with just minutes to spare. Still, no one wants to be James Bond all the time and overall, just not a good user experience. The pause and resume buttons within the parent dashboard, as useful as they seem, do not override the bedtime controls. So thinking that I could just ask the tablet to resume and then manually pause it again 15 minutes later is also a no-go.

#2
Have you previously done in-app purchases and effectively purchased the full version of a game that you would like to share with your child? In-App full version purchases such as those required by Bimi Boo and Pink Fong...

Well sadness is that they simply don't work, your child has to play on the account with which the in-app purchases took place and this defeats the purpose as this is the adult account. Even though you share the apps with the child account, only the free version is shared and not the full version. It is at this point where you begin getting keyboard imprints on your face.

I sat on an amazon help desk chat for well over an hour, was transferred 5 times and they promised to help me and then the last agent being at the actual app store, my final stop, disconnected without initiating the chat. Further keyboard imprints take place.

During that support process I was told I would need to change my child out of the 3-5 age range in order for them to work, not something I wanted to do as it bypassed parental controls for that age group and at the end of the exercise, it was not something that worked anyway. I was then advised to remove and re-add the account, that too did not work. I eventually contacted the creators of Bimi Boo and they told me that the Amazon App store doesn't support the sharing of in-app purchases, I would need to take up the matter with Amazon themselves.

I simply haven't had the energy to revisit this. I do think the only way to do so however, is to be refunded and then do the in-app purchases a second time through the actual device itself. The device is assigned it's own kindle address, but is not otherwise associated with an email address of its own. So I'm not even entirely sure how in-app purchases would work here either.

Anyway, that is $60.00 or so of previously purchased apps which I cannot use unless I repurchase -- gah. I would love to otherwise transfer ownership to that device somehow -- Not like I bought those apps for me anyway.

Rant aside. This is an amazing little device, it is wonderfully responsive and the Kids+ selection is beyond amazing. Everything there is full version and the only 'coins' needed are those you earn in-game. My three year old loves the ""My Hungry Caterpillar"" game where you feed him, play with him and put him to bed for a period of days until he then turns into a beautiful butterfly; after which the whole process begins again. Another firm favourite is ""Little Fox Animal Doctor"" where you cure a number of very cute little characters who are ailing from various illnesses and accidents.

The tablet includes a year free of Kids+ and for a monthly cost of $5 a month, it is definitely worth it for the quality of content, lots of Disney apps too.

My favourite thing about this tablet is that the interface changes based on the age group.
The current group my daughter is in, 3-5 has only images, the next group up 6-12 a has large images and text, finally the teen group pretty much looks as it does in the adult mode. This would actually make a mighty fine Android tablet all on it's own.

In conclusion, other than the cons mentioned above, this is a very worthwhile purchase.",negative
41,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 Kids tablet, 8"" HD display, ages 3-7, 32 GB, Blue Kid-Proof Case",$109.99,5,"Upgraded from Fire 7 Kids tablet, 16 GB, (2019 release). Major improvements!

First, the battery life is fantastic. The Fire 7 would drain its battery in a single day if not left on a charger. I tried messing with every setting without success. The kids use the new Fire 8 for a while, leave it off, then use again, and it's still at like 90% charge the next day.

2nd, there is finally a setting for volume control limits!!!! This was the biggest cause of arguments. 2 kids who want their tablet the loudest. Now you can limit the volume.

USB-C charging, so I think I can finally get rid of my micro-USB cables and use the same USBC i have for everything else already.

32GB will definitely come in handy. I was constantly being warned on the old tablets about full memory, but most of the junk you cannot clear out. The only way to fix them was factory reset, and then they would fill up again. Between kids taking videos and instantly downloading any app they click on, memory gets chewed up fast.

Finally, transferring all data from the previous fire to the new one was so easy. No cables required.

One wish - that Amazon would not let them download any app immediately without anything but a single touch. They don't understand the concept of ROM. Sometimes they push things by accident and I have to uninstall it.",positive

I used to get so tired of constantly having to recharge that thing, to the point where it was almost always dead and my child couldn't use it. It also lagged a whole lot.
This one, on the other hand, stays charged for several days, doesn't lag (opening up youtube videos on the other one would end up in this annoying loop of trying to play the video and stopping, but this one is pretty much instant) I think it's double the RAM so that makes sense. My non-verbal toddler has become very good at using this device and can navigate what he wants to do on his own, and it's nice to see him excel at something when he is delayed in everything else. We don't yet know for sure if he is on the spectrum but for parents stuck in that waiting period of testing this has been really good when it comes to choosing what he wants to do and other skills. It's helped a lot.",positive

We keep an anti-glare screen protector on it to make it easier on the eyes. The profile settings through the parent dashboard are amazing. We have 4 of these now and they all keep the same profile setting I’ve only needed to set once. They also share individual profile personalization my kiddos set themselves. I like being able to monitor what they use the most and how child friendly the apps are. From virtual pets to learning videos they have an extensive selection available to them. They can also have books for reading and it’s awesome I can share some of my books with them as well. Over all I love it, very family friendly and useful in a variety of ways. The bumper on this is amazing too. I was skeptical of tablets for kids but I’m glad we gave this a try. It’s very fun for my kids and they are very excited to share some of the random facts they learn from the wide selection of apps on this device.

I have no idea how this tablet still works just as good as the day I bought it, or even turns on for that matter, but it’s still going and I just have to say it has served it’s purpose many times over! I never wrote reviews good, or bad, but I felt the need to really brag on this product for its durability and all the entertainment and fun my child has gotten from it.

45,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 Kids tablet, 8"" HD display, ages 3-7, 32 GB, Blue Kid-Proof Case",$109.99,4,"I like the tablet, it has lots of good content for my son. I just don’t understand some if the parent controls like the ability to download. I don’t understand why some apps it’ll let the tablet download others I have to ok it. Now he likes to story’s and watches some pbs shows. For the prime day price I’ll say it’s worth it, but normal full price I’m not sure. Below is a more in depth review
Pros:
I like the kid friendly settings. There is one setting that allows you setup the tablet interface for a younger child( one that can’t read) or one for a child that can. Also like the selection of apps and books. I think specs for the price is good, and the case bundled with the tablet is great. The interactive Dr. Seuss books are a hit with my son, and great for him to start exploring books on his own.
Cons:
The app permission setting is a slight miss for me, I put it to where the child can download something’s but idk what constitutes as something he can or cannot download. I also don’t like that there is a subscription, it’s cheap for prime members 4.99 a month and I think 7 for non prime members. But I think it should be included in the prime membership already. Finally the last con, the possibility of some apps or books not being available if I don’t continue the subscription.",positive

(Despite some scary accidents, NONE of these tablets have been damaged at all!)

The possibilities are endless when you are on WiFi, and when we will be off the grid, I load games and videos that can be played/viewed offline. Even the two-year-olds are navigating through games and their favorite movies without assistance.

Why better than an iPad? Well, on an iPad, young kids frequently hit the button on the front or the screen, bumping themselves out of their activities and need assistance getting back in... While the design of the Fire Tablets (buttons all on the side) coupled with the design of the kids' case (thick edge to hold, without touching the screen by accident) eliminates accidentally getting bumped out of an activity by just holding the unit the wrong way!",positive
47,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 Kids tablet, 8"" HD display, ages 3-7, 32 GB, Blue Kid-Proof Case",$109.99,4,"We purchased this tablet for our 3 year old to replace a not so child friendly galaxy tablet we’d been letting her use. She was very excited to see it after I set it up and let it charge. However, we quickly noticed that some of the Amazon Prime Video content she loved and watched on our other tablet was for some reason not available on this Fire kids tablet. I’m talking kids shows such as Blue’s Clues and Bubble Guppies. Instead, you have to add individual videos of those shows (if they are available) from YouTube by going through the settings. I had to watch a YouTube video tutorial to figure out how to do it. The other con is the battery life. It’s supposed to get 12 hours with reasonable use, but I find it gets closer to 6-8. Not a big deal as we always have a charger with us, but something to consider if your child will be primarily using this to watch movies on long trips.
Otherwise, this tablet is excellent. It is very kid friendly and comes with so much content that you would otherwise have to pay for on a different device. We were able to download HBOMAX and Disney+ without any issues. I love knowing my daughter can’t accidentally access the internet and find herself places she shouldn’t be. There is so much downloadable content that it is still usable even when WiFi isn’t available. Overall, we are very happy with our purchase.",positive

EVEN THOUGH AMAZON IS POSTING THIS IS AS A 32G BLACK**

A GREAT LITTLE TABLET FOR WHAT IT IS.

If you're a diehard Amazon customer like I am, then Amazon devices can't be beat for hooking one up to everything that Amazon World offers. And let's not forget Alexa makes it all even easier.

I never thought I'd need or buy a Fire tablet, since I'm already covered with a new laptop, Kindle Reader, 2 Android tablets, and a Samsung phone. My bases were already covered and my nearly 3,000 Kindle books were accessible in several ways. Prime Video and Music work great on all my existing devices, plus I have 2 regular Firesticks and 1 4K Firestick. So why get a Fire tablet?

Well, my two tablets were made obsolete for Kindle when Amazon recently SOMEHOW deregistered both of them from my account and I wasn't able to download the newest Kindle app and repopulate my library. Long story. Enter Fire Tablet HD 8 just when I needed a new device for the Kindle app and the Prime Day price was unbeatable ...

Buying the tablet was really a no-brainer, and a necessity at the time. I ordered the newest 64G WITH ADS and am ecstatic with that choice. After considerable research in comparing capabilities, the 8 was better than the 8 Plus or the 10"" tablet. I don't recommend going lower than 64G even though the 32G is less expensive and memory is expandable. That perk has never worked out well on any device, and we all know that music, movies, and books will gobble up memory faster than a cheetah runs. The white matte finish looks great, but there are things to know before you buy.

** LONG BATTERY LIFE: Surprisingly, I recharge this tablet ONCE EVERY 3 DAYS, despite having it turned on all day with WiFi, and doing alot of Kindle reading.

** SIMPLE OPERATION: After some glitches during setup, and a thorough investigation of the tablet and settings, operation was a snap.

** SETUP ISSUES: I had lots of setup issues due to the endless system updates that were necessary and had to be done in a certain way and order that I couldn't have done on my own even though I'm very savvy with electronics. THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS and it was confusing. That meant being on the phone with tech support to get it all squared away properly. If you're typically Android, this tablet IS NOT ANDROID. IT'S AMAZON. There are similarities, but it's an AMAZON DEVICE THROUGH AND THROUGH.

** SIDEWALK OPTION: Once set up, if you want to opt out of Sidewalk it's very easy within settings.

** ANDROID CONVERTIBLE: For those concerned that it isn't Android and can't download Google Play apps, just go on line for easy instructions on downloading 4 APK files and a launcher in order to turn the tablet into Android and download any apps you want, then create a separate home screen for the Android apps. The current screen is all Amazon apps. Once done, you'll have the best of both worlds combined.

** QUIRKY GLITCHES: I've only had the tablet a few weeks and already there are glitches. The screen occasionally freezes, won't respond to touch, or pages won't open or navigate properly. If you're a heavy reader like I am with an extensive Kindle library and also frequently use Goodreads, there are more glitches. The books that you have ""read"" do not always synch into your GR account on the tablet. My ""friend"" count on GR is also incorrect. GR notifications are spotty. It helps that I double check on my phone app and also email, which are both accurate and up to date on GR notifications.

** A BRICK: Heavier than expected. If you're used to Samsung or Apple, this tablet will feel like a brick and also a bit thick. Expected it to be slimmer and lighter in design.

** SCREEN QUALITY: Picture quality not as sharp or good for movies as my Samsung. You'll notice the difference, but it's still good enough.

** DIFFERENCES: Amazon versions of apps are not quite the same as Android versions. Microphone dictation Notes and Highlights on Kindle books sucks. It doesn't understand most words you say, and you need to close and re-open the microphone to repeat. Very cumbersome and ineffective. This feature works flawlessly on Android, but I often have to type notes manually when I get fed up with the wonky microphone. The whole page layout of books in Kindle App is a bit spotty. Noticed a big difference in the way the Tablet Kindle App operates as opposed to Google Play version on an Android device. Sometimes, I get fed up with the issues, and just read for awhile on my phone when I want to do lots of highlights and notes on a book for reviews.

** DON'T BE AFRAID TO GET THE TABLET ""WITH ADS""! You'll save $15, and can pay it back later if you want the ads removed. The ONLY time I see ads is when I first turn on the tablet on the opening screen. That's it. See my photo of the book ad. No other ads appear during use or at the bottom of the screen as with my Kindle Reader. It's more of a screen saver that swipes away. As long as you are on the tablet and the screen doesn't go dark, no new or additional ads will appear.

** TOUCH SCREEN RESPONSIVENESS: The screen doesn't always respond. Locks up. Not sure if this will get worse or ""it is what it is"". NOT an issue that I have with Android.

** DIFFERENT LAYOUTS: Amazon Prime Video not laid out the same as Android. I couldn't even find my Watch List, until I noticed my profile icon and ""My Stuff"" at bottom of the screen. Why so different Amazon?

** ADJUSTMENT PERIOD: This tablet will take some adjustment, especially if comparing to Android. Although it's geared for Amazon apps, there are more glitches than I prefer, the same as has been happening with all the recent website feature changes on the PC.

It's an okay tablet and perfectly functional especially for Kindle books, music, and Prime Video if you have those subscriptions. 1st 6 months of Washington Post is free. Personally, the tablet needs some improvements and is adequate, but a bit less than expected. It's not the ideal option if you want Android capability, but remember that it is convertible. Because I bought it on Prime Day, I also got a free 3-month, first-time subscription to Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN. I see that offer is still available in another way on Amazon that still might apply to this purchase, so if you're thinking of buying be sure to check the promo with customer service first.

Overall, I'm happy with the tablet, the memory, and the functionality of Amazon World in general which I navigate on a daily basis, but there are some limitations from an android standpoint.

FYI: My photos show the main screen with pre-loaded Amazon apps, an example of a ""free ad"", and one with the Prime Video screen.",positive

I purchased 8 of these Fire tablets for use in an elementary classroom. They were to be used exclusively to access the Myon ereader app through our district’s Clever page. Sounded simple enough! Yet, I have had the most frustrating experience with educational technology I have ever had.

First, I set up a child’s profile so that I could limit what the students had access to. The child’s profile comes preloaded with 100 videos/apps on the home screen! It was insane! (Note that this is not the “Kids” Fire, just a regular one with a child profile set up.) It took 4 different customer serv agents and about 3 hours to finally find someone who could tell me how to turn them off. It ended up being a simple toggle, so how could that many people not know how? (This was after I had searched through multiple threads online from frustrated parents with the same issue.) FYI, in the child’s profile, toggle off the option to Enable web access. However, this means that you will then have to go in an Allow Content for every app that you do want them to access as well as allow every web page they can go to. For me, not a huge deal because I bought these for one specific purpose, but as you will see below, even that was a ridiculously frustrating process.

After figuring out the toggle solution, I started going into the settings of each Kindle to set them up. On the 8th and final Kindle, it didn’t work. After restarting and then trying to power off/wait/power on, I finally decided to delete the profile and reinstall it. Upon doing this, the child profile interfaces of ALL 8 tablets completely changed. The original wallpaper/setup was single solid light blue page with cloud outline in background. After I reinstalled the profile, the wallpaper was a black/aqua/purple paint splatter with a “For Me”, “Home”, and some other tab. Under the For Me tab were ALL the videos and apps that I had disabled access to. Even though the toggle was set to disable, they were all back and could be opened. I then factory reset the device, and it still didn’t work. I finally tried to create yet another new child profile, and then it finally went back. No rhyme or reason.

So, now to the task of setting them up for Myon. I downloaded the Myon app, but it would not work. I think this was an issue on our district permission side. (And even though I did a press/hold and told it to remove the app from the profile and then completely deleted Myon from my account via the Content and Devices setting of my Amazon.com account, it was still showing up! And if the child tapped it, it became stuck in a loop of trying to install an app that was no longer there.) Anyway, I was told by our Academic Tech dept to go through the Clever app. Guess what – it’s not available on the Amazon app store. So, I had to go through the web. In the Allow Content section of Settings, you can allow specific websites, which is great. However, even though I allowed the website to access Clever, at every step, the child’s profile web browser said no permission. I had to enable every single page the kids will go through to get to their Myon account, and even then they have to know to navigate around an “Uh oh” page that still pops up every time, even though I allowed it.

Because of this, I needed to make step-by-step instructions by taking screenshots so I could print for the kids so they could remember all these steps. However, screenshots taken while in child’s profile cannot be located anywhere, not in the child or adult profiles. (Camera and photo storage had been enabled.) Regular photos taken with the camera could be found in the photos app, and I found an online thread suggesting going through the Files app, but they are nowhere to be found. I can’t take the screenshots in the adult profile because the screen looks completely different. I spent 20 minutes on chat with a CSR this morning only to be told he would ‘notify the team.’ The threads I read about this same issue were from 2020 and 2021, so I’m sure they know and have chosen not to fix it.

My multiple chat sessions were also frustrating. With this particular one, I took the time to write out, in detail, the exact steps I followed, only to have him ask – two separate times - if I had tried something that I had already said I tried. I had this same issue with other CSR chats. These are the least knowledgeable CSRs I have ever dealt with. One, named Jestin, kept telling me to tap the Menu button, and there was not a menu button on my screen. After hanging up with her, I continued to research online, and found the exact script she was using, and it was for a Kindle eReader, not a Fire! She didn’t even have the right device, and she kept getting very angry with me when I couldn’t follow her instructions. She kept me on hold for 10 minutes when I asked to speak with someone else, then came back on and (unsurprisingly) said she couldn’t find anyone else.

I usually have great customer service with Amazon, but they have truly failed with their training related to the Kindle Fire devices. They would have me wait for 10 minutes sometimes, only to come back and ask me to try something that I had already told them I tried.

Almost every single thing I have tried to do with these has required me to spend an inordinate amount of time researching previous threads, chatting online with a specialist, or on the phone. It took 3 separate calls to finally get someone who was willing to take over my Fire so they could see what I was seeing, and even so, I still cannot use them in the way that I need to. You definitely get what you pay for, I guess. Such a shame when teachers have to use their own money to provide these opportunities for their students. I have wasted hours of my time and a lot of my money. I hope I can save another teacher some of this endless frustration.",negative
62,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 tablet, 8"" HD display, 32 GB, latest model (2020 release), designed for portable entertainment, Black",$69.99,3,"I was looking for a wall-mounted pad to centralize and control my Alexa-based smart home. For the price, you can't beat it, but it's a hack (at best) with mixed results. The HD8 is a perfect size for this kind of application.

There are several aftermarket wall mounts, I'm very happy with the one I got, but I did need to saw it to get access to the volume controls. You will need to access them frequently so look for a mount with exposed volume buttons. My mount has wired USB power but there are several options from POE to mains on most available 3rd party mounts.

Smart Home Dashboard:

The ""show mode"" has a dedicated button on the lower task bar which is handy, but it only surfaces ~50% of your smart devices and lacks support for groups, routines and other functionality. You'll still need to launch the native Alexa App to have the needed functionality. The native Alexa App is UGLY on this device as compared to the stock android version. It can only show in white (light theme), and it's missing a GUI — it looks like a 1990's HTML web page that doesn't have CSS support.

The main challenges I'll share are two-fold; making the user experience streamlined, and integrating with media playback.

User Experience

Shovelware! The price is low because this is jam-pact with marketing shovelware, everything is crammed with upsells, recommendations, and tons of clutter. Getting the GUI to be simple and intuitive requires a lot of setup config to systematically remove all the clutter, but it is possible with dedication. The stock desktop backgrounds are all bright and busy, I had to link to my Amazon photos and upload a solid grey image to replace the crazy graphics because there are no solid color stock backgrounds available in the settings.

There's an upsell when you buy the pad to ""remove lock-screen ads"" you absolutely should buy that option unless you want a crazy distracting flashing panel on your wall.

I suggest enabling the recent apps ""continue"" option on the homescreen setting that creates a large UI component with the last 6 apps used. Much easier to see than a cluster of small icons spread over the desktop. This is a great feature and should be developed more. In my application as a smart home dashboard, 6 featured apps are more than enough.

Media Playback

The speakers on the pad are tiny and cheap, you'll need to bluetooth or hard-wire from the headphone jack to get any acceptable sound. It supports the Alexa multi-room speaker groups feature, but you'll need to add the phrase ""play XXX on the XXX group"" everytime you ask for audio playback, and limit yourself to only a few Amazon sanctioned music services, I think that's a really terrible user experience.

You can bluetooth to another Echo speaker, but if that speaker is set up as a stereo pair, you'll only get it to play on one, not both. Basicly the media playback functionality is sub par and needs a lot of work.

For my application, I elected NOT to use the pad for the Alexa/music speaker group support and instead bluetooth it to my network Yamaha receiver. This decision was partly because I use the PLEX app to serve my home media needs, and the PLEX skill only works locally on any given Alexa device and is blocked from using speaker groups. I'd need to enjoy my music on the tablet's 1/4"" speakers, or bluetooth to an external device.

To complicate matters further this solution required me to use the Yamaha AV Controller android app to remotely choose inputs and receiver volume or—I'd need to run back to the media hub to change the receiver settings defeating the purpose of a remote pad.

Unfortunately, the Yamaha AV Controller android app is not available in the Fire Appstore as is typical with all other audio-gear manufacturer apps. The Fire App Store is for your children. It's only has super-basic apps but with thousands of games for kids—little for the grown-ups—and none for my purpose.

I won't advocate that you violate the Amazon terms of service, but I was able to get the Yamaha AV Controller android app installed after some research and effort. I don't suggest you try this unless you're comfortable with android system alterations, but it is possible to put Google Play Services on the pad with the full play store app catalog. We'll see how long it works until future Fire updates break it.

Bottom Line

Pros:

—Price
—3rd party mounting options

Cons:

—Shovelware!!
—Lack of full device support in ""show mode""
—Ugly native Alexa app
—Sub-par media connectivity
—Limited to Amazon-sanctioned music services
—App store lacking apps for grown-ups
—Limited config/UI options

Someday Amazon will evolve their Echo hardware with added 5.1 abilities and I'll likely toss my receiver in favor of a native 5.1 Echo solution. Running two independent sound systems, with two independent speaker sets isn't a great experience, but clearly Amazon is working towards a better home media environment. They will need to have support non-amazon music/media services, especially local playback services like PLEX as any ""owned"" media is currently blocked in their ecosystem, like many others, I'm not happy paying monthly service fees to rent the media I already own and Amazon has stopped allowing user uploads to their music services—only Amazon-purchased music is available. Nope, not a usable solution!

Even with all the limitations, I believe it's a tortured but acceptable solution for a centralized dashboard if you're willing to do what it takes to get it to look and function properly.

Good luck!",fair
63,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 tablet, 8"" HD display, 32 GB, latest model (2020 release), designed for portable entertainment, Black",$69.99,3,"Okay, let me start by saying that I am currently on my second fire tablet. The first was a gift from my last job and was an Amazon Fire 7 2017 edition. It was, as one would expect from a cheap tablet, very slow and low quality. However, it was still a great tablet for the price. I believe that they were running somewhere around $50-$75 at the time I received it and regardless of the quality, it worked far better than any smartphone I had seen around the same price. I was able to expand memory and I used it for personal and professional services for almost 4 years. So it definitely served its purpose. Last year my wife was tired of me always complaining about how slow it had gotten and how limited it was on being able to keep up with newer apps. So she bought me an Amazon Fire HD 8 2021 for Christmas in the hopes that it would fix the issues I was having with my 2017 model. That brings me to the real point of this review. Having used this tablet for almost a year now I can say again that this is an excellent tablet for the price. I only have a few complaints that I was hoping Amazon had fixed since the 2017 model.

1) The screen is just not bright enough. It's fine when you are inside in a low light area but when you walk outside, especially on a sunny day, you can't see anything on the screen. That's with the brightness level at max and adaptive brightness turned off. (Wanted to clarify for those of you who might think I don't know what I'm doing)
2) The screen lags when switching between apps and when loading apps. This was a major problem with the 2017 Fire 7 but I had hoped that, with all of Amazon's internal hardware and software upgrades that it would be faster but it's about the same still. It's just definitely not made for multi-tasking or gaming really. You can multi-task but it's difficult due to the lag. However, it's a great option for those of you who just want to binge watch your favorite movies and shows on streaming apps and/or use it for ebooks, music, or shopping.
3) The battery life is about the same as my 2017 which was also very disappointing. On a full charge I can usually get about 4-5 hours of solid use before it's almost dead (that was brand new), about 8-10 hours of intermittent use, and if left on but inactive (on standby) you can get up to 3 days on a full charge before it dies. However I will also say that those numbers have not decreased much, if any, over the past 8 months of use. So at least the battery life seems to be fairly consistent.
4) While the tablet is very ""user friendly"", it's not very good for those of you who like to poke around the more technical side of things. You basically have to download a bunch of secondary apps to read or change deeper settings than what you see on the basic menu.

*IMPORTANT NOTICE*
You should never change or alter the programming of any device. Doing this can damage your device, void manufacturer warranties, and may even be illegal in some cases. So make sure you know what the manufacturer as well as your local and federal law allows before you do anything that can alter or potentially harm your device. All repairs, alterations, and any other changes should always be handled by the manufacturer or other industry professionals who are trained to work on your specific device.

To sum it all up, remember that this is a cheap tablet so don't expect your Fire to keep up with the latest iPad because it can't. That being said, it really is a good tablet overall.
Especially when you consider that the closest thing to it from another company would cost you at least twice as much. So for the very last time I'll say, it's an excellent tablet for the price! Thank you",fair

She helped me pick out a replacement Kindle Fire & suggested I get one with more storage because I already own hundreds of books ... I liked this one - plus it came in a pretty color ... When I received it my daughter easily walked me through ""restoring"" ALL of my Books & things that I had before on my old tablet onto my New tablet ...

The old one still functions great after five years, but I felt an upgrade was in order, so opted for one the same size. I decided not to go with the bigger model simply because I already had something in that size in the form of my iPad, and going with a bigger one would defeat my reason for going smaller and lighter. So far I've been extremely happy with it. While it's no speed demon, I didn't buy it for that, so I'm very happy with its performance. The big key I see in being happy with this is using it for what it's intended for and not as an iPad type replacement. If you're looking for a speedy platform that can handle all sorts of video play, then this is not for you.

66,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 tablet, 8"" HD display, 32 GB, latest model (2020 release), designed for portable entertainment, Black",$69.99,4,"It's not an iPad. It's not a Samsung tablet. It has some inherent limitations, but for the price, it ain't bad.

The Kindle Fire HD is a tablet. It was designed to be an entry point into Amazon-world, and it is optimized for shopping, games and entertainment (streaming). But it can do a lot more as long as the user understands its limitations.

The biggest limitation is that it is connectable ONLY via Wifi, so anything that you want to do that requires an interface to the Internet requires that you be within range of an accessible Wifi hub. That mean you can't web-surf or stream a video at a campsite in the woods. But it's just as responsive on our home Wifi as my wife's iPad or my iPhone.

The Kindle Fire uses Amazon's proprietary version of the Android operating system, so its basic functionality will be familiar if you are accustomed to an Android phone. However, it also means that the normal channel for obtaining apps is via the Amazon app store. Like Google Play and the Apple App store, the selection of apps is pretty extensive. However, the Amazon collection is limited in some areas - eg, the on-line apps for many local banks aren't available.

While it is not possible to download apps from Google Play to the Kindle Fire directly out of the box, there is a way to augment the basic offering so that apps can be retrieved from Google. Do a Google search for installing the Google Play Store on a Kindle Fire - note that the instructions are a little involved and must be followed carefully.

There are a number of basic apps included on the device - none of which can be removed. Some are simply other versions of more familiar apps. For example, the native browser is Silk - seemingly different from Firefox or Google, but with much the same functionality. Likewise, the native map app is actually Here - which is highly respected in many countries outside North America. After devoting a little 'play time' to these, I found that they are quite usable. Apps that you don't need/want can be clustered in an 'Unused App' folder so that they don't clutter up the screen. E-mail works well.

The price is very attractive, and I was surprised at the apparent build quality - to my mind, it compares very favorably with an iPad. Only time will tell how it holds up. The screen is bright. Sound is ok but if you want higher quality audio, I suspect that you could use the built-in Bluetooth to link to an external audio system.",positive

It is NOT an iPad or Samsung, it is an Amazon content delivery device. It is inexpensive because Amazon provides the content and they want you to have a cheap way to enjoy it. It is an E Reader, Music Player, Video Player not a full fledged Android Tablet. Like most Amazon devices it has ads on the lock screen. Any other ads are the fault of the apps. It can be massaged to load apps from Google Play but it wasn't designed for that and results will vary. Expecting this to perform like an iPad or Samsung is wishful thinking of the highest degree. If you can't afford an iPad, don't blame this unit. Don't buy it to do anything but read, listen and watch. I've worn out several of the Fire units over the years and I loved them. They are electronic devices and as such are likely to fail at some point. It's reality. I own 2 iPads as well as This Kindle, an old fire (USB port finally died) and a Kindle Paperwhite. They all serve a purpose. I read constantly and sometimes the Paperwhite is right, Sometimes the Fire is right. The iPads are PC replacements for me and do everything I need to run a small business and record music. I don't expect any of the Kindles to be iPads. Warranty is commensurate with value. 90 days is enough to verify operation. After 90 days you're just unlucky or you dropped the unit so many times it gave up. iPads have a 1 year warranty and you pay for it. My last iPad cost me over $500. I expect a lot more from it than I do a Kindle. I apologize for ranting but it sucks that good products suffer because of bad expectations. A Kindle Fire is a great device for what it was intended to do. I don't really like backlit screens for reading, but sometimes they're desirable. I can watch Movies, Listen to Audiobooks, Listen to music, Stream content and read books and magazines. All on one device that has a screen I don't have to squint at to enjoy. All for a very reasonable price. I had some A-hole grab my fire and run while I was getting a drink refill and it wasn't a nightmare... like if he had run off with my iPad.

This new unit has a few ups and downs: UPs: The device is much lighter and easier to hold than the old one. The screen is bright and responsive. It has lots of features for use as a tablet beyond just reading that allow it to compete with Samsung Tab and iPad. DOWNs: The battery does not seem to last as long in the new version. This may help make it lighter, but for moderate use, you will need to charge daily (before, my wife plugged in the old one every few days). Ad-supported price. We got this one for an incredible deal during Prime Day. In the smaller print, the price is Ad-supported, so customer directed ads would appear on the lock screen. Not too bad, but my wife didn't like, so we had to pay Amazon the $15 ransom to remove the ads. (on the up-side, the $15 is a one-time charge, not a subscription).
We are currently having some trouble with a feature that alerts you if moisture has entered the charging port. We keep getting the alert even if the fire tablet has not been near any liquid. I have to do a little more research on that. it may have a defect.

Everything I can do on a Kindle Fire, I can do on my iPad better. Reading, streaming, e-mails, social media, games... literally everything. The OS on the Fire tablet is clunky in comparison. Even the virtual keyboard doesn't work as well for me.

Oh, and with the Alexa enabled on the Fire, when I use it in the same room as an Echo (which is everywhere in my house), they don't work together very well. I'll say ""Alexa, display the weather on my Kindle Fire,"" my Echo briefly lights up, makes a low beep, and says nothing. The weather doesn't display on my Fire.

Right now my Fire tablet is mounted as a display for showing me the time and weather, and I rarely pick it up anymore. It's essentially an Echo Show now. Maybe if I were going somewhere and was afraid my iPad would get stolen or damaged, I'd take it with me. But I have a Kindle Paperwhite too, and I'd rather have that stolen or damaged than my Fire.

If you've never had an iPad and you want a solid tablet device, by all means save money and get a Fire tablet. But my iPads (I've had 3 so far) have totally spoiled me! I now read from my Kindle library on my iPad's Kindle app. It's much easier to use than reading on the Fire. The Fire's user interface is slow & clumsy. There's a reason the Kindle tablets are priced much lower than an iPad's. My sling bag feels much lighter without both my iPad and Fire since I started leaving my Fire at home every day.

5* review for successfully resolved my low 2.4G speed problem, excellent support from TP Link and fast 5G speed that exceeds Verizon Fios max speed of 300Mbps.

The purpose of this review is to compare the 2.4G and 5G speeds of the TP Link Archer A7(AC1700) WiFi 5 router and AX21(AX1800) WiFi 6 router using an iPhone 11 which supports WiFi 6. The highest speed I can test is 300Mbps limited by my Verizon Internet plan. Measurement results using show that using the WiFi 5 router, the 2.4G speed is 60M/80M (UL/DL) and the 5G speed is 307M/330M, whereas using the WiFi 6 router, the 2.4G speed is 110M/120M and the 5G speed is about same.

Newer routers’ real life 5G speed is very high and normally is not a problem, but real life 2.4G speed could be slow. It is not entirely sure which part of the wireless link is limiting the 2.4G speed. Below examines the speed limit of the WiFi standards involved, the router and iPhone 11.

WiFi 6 (max speed 9.6G) not only has higher speed than WiFi 5 (max speed 3.5G) but also can support more devices using orthogonal frequency division multiple access. The main differences are given in picture 1.
(Picture 1 from : https://www.mwrf.com/technologies/systems/article/21849959/whats-the-difference-between-wifi-5-and-wifi-6)

Comparing the specs of these two routers, one has a higher 2.4G speed while the other has a higher 5G speed. But in real life, according to my measurements, at 2.4G, the WiFi 6 router has almost twice the speed than the WiFi 5 router. I don’t have a high enough wireless speed plan to test the 5G speed. In my house both routers have the same speed of 310M, limited by the max speed allowed by Verizon Fios 300M.

Speeds specified by the WiFi standards are speeds the router manufacturers trying to meet and they are not the limit, but speeds advertised by the router are the speeds that customers want the router to be able to reach. They become upset if they are unable to get the speeds advertised by the router.

Routers often do not specified under what link conditions these seemingly advertised high speeds could be realized. For example what is the required bandwidth, the number of antennas (the so called MIMO) and how pure the signal has to be (the signal to noise ratio). Is the bandwidth 20, 40, 80 or 160M? Is the signal to noise ratio has to be greater than 10dB?

In real life, link speed depends on how far from the router (the signal strength) and radio interference which falls in band (the signal to noise ratio). The former can be solved by doing the speed test right next to the router, where the transmit signal from the router is at maximum. But for the latter, unless one has a so called Faraday Cage, there is no way to block in-band interference especially at 2.4G, which are used by microwave ovens, Bluetooth and many household devices. Interference is hard to quantify without using a spectrum analyzer and could become an excuse if one calls the router support line complaining low speed.

Another limit is the device itself, and in this case iPhone 11. It’s specs are given below.

Wi-Fi specifications for iPhone 11
802.11 standard, name, frequency Maximum PHY data rate Maximum channel bandwidth Maximum MCS index Maximum spatial streams
ax@5 GHz 1200 Mbps 80 MHz 11 (HE) 2/MIMO
ac@5 GHz 866 Mbps 80 MHz 9 (VHT) 2/MIMO
a/n@5 GHz 300 Mbps 40 MHz 7 (HT) 2/MIMO
ax@2.4 GHz 195 Mbps 20 MHz 9 (HE) 2/MIMO
b/g/n@2.4 GHz 144 Mbps 20 MHz 7 (HT) 2/MIMO
(From: https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/iphone-wi-fi-specification-details-dep268652e6c/web)

https://mcsindex.com gives more details about how the speed on each band is affected by modulation scheme, number of antennas, bandwidth and WiFi standards used, not only for iPhones but for routers as well.

From the iPhone 11 specs, only “n” and “ax” support 2.4GHz if we ignore the older standards “b” and “g”. At 2.4G, The maximum speeds for “n” is 144M whereas for “ax” is 195M. The max bandwidth for both is 20MHz which needs to be set in the router. Setting the bandwidth to 40MHz could lower the speed as the noise power will be doubled.

However, at 5GHz the speed for ac (WiFi 5) is 866M with 80M max bandwidth whereas for ax (WiFi 6) is 1200M also with 80M max bandwidth. These bandwidths should also be specified in the router. Setting the bandwidth too high or too low could lower the speed.

From the iPhone 11 max speeds, it is clear that the wireless link’s speed is not limited by both the A7 and AX21 routers and the standards, but by the iPhone 11 at 2.4G and by Verizon Fios at 5G.

I have Verizon Fios 300M download and upload. Initially, I used an A7, thinking that at 2.4GHz, the router speed is 450M which is higher than iPhone’s 144M(“n”) and 195M(“ax), surely shouldn’t be a problem. But speed test showed that I got only 60M download and 80M upload from the best channel and 20M bandwidth (I tested all the channels and bandwidth combinations).

60M is too slow for me because I have several devices (such as security cameras) using 2.4G. So I called TP Link support line to see what I had done wrong. Most customer supports didn’t know what the problem was the and finally I was connected to a high level support. She said that in real life, I had to multiply the speed by 30-50% and guided me through the various specs of the wireless link. I don’t know where the 30-50% comes from, perhaps it was her empirical experience. If I use the average of 40% and assume that applies to the lower speed of the router and the iPhone, which is 144MHz. 40%x144M is 57M. This was about what I got at 2.4G using the A7 router.

But she also said something about WiFi 6 router and got me thinking perhaps a WiFi 6 router could improve the speed. (I must say that I got excellent support from TP Link, I had gotten calls twice from the specialist unsolicited and many followup emails. All trying to help me solve the low speed problem.)

I then change the A7(AC1700) to an AX21(AX1800), which does support WiFi 6 “ax”.

The main advantage of using AX21 is that it raised the iPhone 11 max speed at 2.4G from 144M to 195M, a gain of 51M. And as a result, in real life, the 2.4G link speed seemed to have increased by about the same amount. Speed test showed that at 2.4G, I now got ~90-110M(download, previously 60M when using A7) and 100-120M(upload) with the channel and bandwidth set on auto. Though the download speed is still less than 195M, the link speed has increased by changing to a router that supports ax and has 4 antennas. Have no idea if a more expensive router will further increase the 2.4G speed.

However, at 5GHz, both routers give 307M download and 330M upload, limited by Verizon Fios max speed of 300M.

When doing speed test, I shut off all 2.4G emitters. I live in a rural area and I suspect there is little interference.

A7 has 3 antennas whereas AX21 has four. Is the speed improvement at 2.4G due to the additional antenna or the support of WiFi 6 or both?",positive

I bought this router to help her avoid paying monthly equipment rental fees for the router the provider would supply. I'm also not a fan of the out-of-the-box features/performance of ""supplied"" routers.

I had read great reviews on this router so I thought I'd give it a chance with her setup. I couldn't believe this router had a quad core processor in it at this price point. I'm expecting wifi performance to be excellent when all of her grandkids are in town trying to use the internet. Being a WiFi 6 router, MU-MIMO is a feature of this router which should greatly improve the experiences of simultaneous wifi users.

EDIT:. This router is NOT equipped with a quad core processor. It's only a dual core which means it won't handle multiple simultaneous users as well. I found this out after opening the admin page through the web and watching there CPU activity. It appears the V3 revision of this model was reduced to a dual core CPU. I suspect it could be fired to overheating problems from older quad core versions. Be aware.

:END EDIT

Setting up the router was done by simply setting up a tplink id on their website and then using the TPLink Tether app to setup the router. This was easy and no PC or ethernet cable was needed. The app itself offers access to the most basic functions of the router including client bandwidth monitoring. For the more advanced features, you'll need to access the router's admin page via a web browser. I'm a little disappointed in the limited function of the Tether app and would expect it to offer a similar suite of controls as the admin page does.

The router itself needed to cover about a 2000 sq ft house and it does this. I can go anywhere in the house and get a strong signal. The speeds are not limiting at all. The ISP itself provides 250mbps down and 135mbps up and those speeds are with wifi 6 supported devices. The more traditional wifi 5 devices come in at around 200mbps at their weakest locations in the house. I'm very happy with the overall performance.",positive
82,Computers & Accessories,"TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 Router (Archer AX21) – Dual Band Wireless Internet Router, Gigabit Router, USB port, Works with Alexa - A Certified for Humans Device",$89.99,5,"I wanted a more secure WiFi router while also saving money on the rental from my cable provider, so I was suggested to purchase this by a very experienced tech and cyber security wiz. Now, I personally don't feel that I know much about anything technical these days, but I have really enjoyed this so far. Performance wise, but more than anything I REALLY love the security of the back-office type of controls the TP-Link gives you.

PERFORMANCE
Now, my current home is 1500 sq ft and a split level home, so most of the areas I use WiFi at home are never too far from the router. I placed the router right on the TV stand underneath the TV so that certainly is as close as it gets. When I'm upstairs (technically 1.5 levels up from the router) I still seem to get fine enough WiFi when I'm browsing on my phone. I will say that the WiFi randomly cuts out for me, but, this is definitely an issue I had with my previous equipment so I don't blame the router itself, it is my provider. Or the wiring outside my house.. not really sure. I have noticed however that when the service does go out, ever since changing to the TP-Link, the service returns much faster and I never have to reset it. With my old provider-provided router, it would be out for hours and I always seemed to have to manually reset the equipment. So in summary, the service and performance for me has been exemplary!

SOFTWARE
The primary reason I got this was to make sure nobody could hack into my WiFi. With other routers, I am not sure if the same service is available, but this was the first I've ever seen it. Yes... we all know that WiFi is password protected. BUT. Someone can easily hack into it, right? Well not with the TP-Link! You can access the router security through the routers IP address, and you set a password for that as well. The user interface is pretty simple for even a dolt like myself to understand. You can control who can access your WiFi by using a blacklist or a whitelist. A blacklist means that all who have the login details *except* for specific IP addresses you've blocked can access. A whitelist means that ONLY the IP addresses you have added to your list can access the WiFi. I am using the whitelist, since I do not want anyone random or unwanted accessing my service. Let me tell you, it works perfectly! Sometimes I forget that I have this setup, and I have tried many times with many different devices to try and access the wifi... heck, even the guest network, that I thought was specifically setup for this, doesn't seem to let random users access it. It also shows you who is currently accessing it, although I find that feature doesn't seem to be totally accurate sometimes. I give the software 5 stars for the simple fact that it is so easy to control access through it.

SUMMARY
Overall I am very happy with this purchase. It does what I want it to do, very securely. Setup was a little confusing because if I recall correctly, nobody could access it until we were able to get into the back-office software and setup password first. Other than that I really have had no issues and enjoy using it. When I need to change a setting it is super easy to get in and make any adjustments.",positive
83,Computers & Accessories,"TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 Router (Archer AX21) – Dual Band Wireless Internet Router, Gigabit Router, USB port, Works with Alexa - A Certified for Humans Device",$89.99,5,"Long review but hopefully helpful:

Bought this to replace an aged Airport Extreme and give my Oculus Quest 2 a better WiFi connection. So far so good.

Set up was okay but I had some trouble getting the Ethernet light to go green despite all the others being green and I was unable to get online via wired or wireless connection. If you reboot your modem and this device, go make coffee or something when it is starting back up because the router takes a while to restart. The light finally went green but it did feel like it took an inordinate amount of time.

I understand the frustration that comes with setting up these new things and the rage factor sometimes enters the picture. If it does: unplug the cable modem and the router, leave everything unplugged for 5 minutes, plug in the cable modem and wait until it is fully booted up, plug in this router and walk away for a bit. Give it 5-10 minutes and hopefully you'll be good to go.

The interface looks a bit dated and clonky but most do. Seems the least priority is given to creating a clean, attractive interface for all these things, but coming from an Airport Extreme where you have essentially no features to work with, this is a dream. The ability to edit the names of the clients is something I was never able to do before and it really makes a difference.

I wanted something with the ability to kick clients off the network while I am using the Quest to ensure it has no bandwidth competition with devices that are not in use at the time the Quest is being used, but then put them back on without having to jump through hoops, re-entering passwords and such. I have a lot of devices on my network and while they may not be in use, they are still hovering around and eating up some bandwidth even while idling.

This router allows that in an easy peasy way but the icons used are confusing. First, if you go to the Network map, clients section, you will see a list of all the clients on your network. You can click the pencil next to the name of the device and change it to make life easier. On the right side, if you click Block, that client gets blacklisted and cannot connect to the network. If you click View Blacklist, you will see all of the blocked clients and there is a garbage can icon on the right. This is a confusing and poor icon choice because most people would think that this will remove the client entirely. It doesn't. It simply puts the client back on the whitelist. It's a great thing to have, for example:

Let's say you have a Zoom meeting and want to ensure that there's as little connection issues as possible. You can block all other clients on the network that are not needed and have all the bandwidth to yourself for your meeting and when it's over, just click the garbage can on each device in the blacklist and poof! they are all able to connect again.

I am not really understanding the point of the QoS feature on this device because in the past when I've set up QoS in a work environment, you are able to directly allocate bandwidth to devices. Ideally, this would be what you would use if you had a Zoom call rather than kicking clients off for a time. With this router's QoS, you have two choices: On or Off. Each device listed has a Priority switch that is turned on or off. You can turn on the Priority switch for one, some or all devices, but there's nothing else, so you have no idea how bandwidth allocation is implemented here.

Under the On/Off switch for QoS, there is a bandwidth allocation box for both upload and download with each set at 1000. You can change this number, but again, it doesn't tell you how it will divvy out that bandwidth to the clients. If you only have one device with the Priority turned on, you are left to wonder what that client is getting as opposed to other devices on the network. That's kind of a shame because you can prioritize a device for Always or for a couple of hours. Would seem the perfect set up for a Zoom meeting as you can give Priority to your device for a set amount of time and the router will release that restriction at the end of the hour or two or whatever you chose without you having to interact with the admin page at all. Unfortunately, you cannot enter times: i.e,. Priority from 10 a.m. to noon. You can choose Always, 1 hour, 2 hours, or 4 hours.

I'm not sure what people are talking about regarding monthly fees for Parent Controls. I don't have kids, but opened it up and you can add a child's computer as a device, block certain keywords from being searched online and limit the days/times that your child can get online. I didn't see anything about fees or payment for those features.

I have noticed more zip in my Quest 2 since setting up this router and am quite pleased with it so far. I set up a 5ghz network set to AX only for the Quest's exclusive use, a 2.4ghz Guest Network for all the Echos, Kindles, switches for lights, etc., and a 2.4ghz network for laptops, iPads, etc.",positive

I called tech support and explain the situation for example with one of the product that needed a lower GHz, The Ring Doorbell but I did need the WiFi 6 with the majority of my other devices in order for them to work.
To my surprise he understood exactly what I was trying to say and less than a minute he walked me through the process and showed me how to identify which devices needed the lower GHz and those needing the highest GHz and how to name them on my WiFi YEA!!!

For years, my home network was run by two (2) hard wired Airport Extremes. With the 2nd Airport Extreme extending the WiFi.

The past year, as we have started streaming more devices, I was noticing that our two WiFi AppleTVs would start to lag. On top of that, certain areas of the house had terrible reception. It got to the point, it was better to just switch phone to cellular than try to deal with the lag.

After realizing that Airport Extreme hasn’t had an update in 3 years and they were not WiFi 6 while all of our Apple Devices are WiFi 6 capable, I started to research various Routers with WiFi 6 capabilities.

My final solution in our 2 story 3,300 sq. foot house consists of the following

TP-Link AX1800 Router
TP-Link RE700X Range Extender
TP-Link RE600X Range Extender

The areas with the dead spots are completely covered and speed test regularly between 90Mbps down/up.

The furthest point of the house now test regularly over 150Mbps down and 100 up.

I said I bought the little guy for a reader so I really can’t complain, but like many of us now I rarely read—or get bored with even Dean Koontz quite easily.

The picture is bright and clear, user friendly, but is not the iPhone as I am spoiled by—but maybe more like an Android smart phone? (Can’t really say since I haven’t had one in at least a decade. ) I can’t speak to battery life either since I charge it daily when I charge my Apple Watch and never use it more than an hour at a time. Guess I need to put it to the test in that. I like that I can use an SD card too—does anyone even use those anymore? I haven’t in years, maybe a decade; I did get the 32g though so maybe I won’t need one. (Don’t even know where to get one, lol; guess I’ll Google Amazon though huh? 🤣)

I bought my Fire pad on payments, really love that here, but I fear Amazon is becoming the Blair of my mother’s time, lol, sucking us in with payments. Five or six things on payments gets you up to $100 or more a month so beware! All in all I love it (I must say I do have a 2017 iPad but I just had to have the big one. I rarely use it due to its humongous size and yet it neither functions as a computer nor is it a tablet, just awkward and heavy with the typing pad one needs to use it properly—hate hate hate hate hate hate digital type pads. Big mistake buying it though. I loved my small iPad of when they first came out, should have just upgraded to that with a new iMac desk top but at $700 I wasn’t replacing it now when my Firepad is $79. ) I’m also getting a kid Firepad for my grandson for his second birthday—maybe the smarta$$ will stop chasing after our phones and remotes, anything with a lighted button! (If your child doesn’t do that maybe something is wrong with him or her, 🤣🤣🤣. )",positive

So this one is definitely a step up from that. I just got tired of the Fire OS - it was too locked up and not as robust as regular Android. Plus, there is one mindless Android game that I love that isn't available in the Amazon App Store, so that's a thing.

I like to talk a lot before getting to the actual review. Sorry. Context is important for me.

***Actual review***

I decided to buy a new Fire because I wanted something a little larger than my phone screen (I have a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, which actually has a pretty large screen) to watch movies on when on vacation. Fires tend to be cheaper than most tablets, so I looked there first. This came up with decent specs for an amazing price, so I bought one. Then realized that it wouldn't be out until 6/29.

I got it yesterday and set it up. Here are my impressions:

Kindle Fire 7 with 32gb storage & no ads.

Pros
- Perfect size to watch movies on an airplane tray table
- Decent screen resolution (my eyesight isn't what it used to be, and this is still better than everything I had growing up)
- Made for Amazon environment, so Prime Video, Audible, and Kindle books work great. Mostly.
- Most of the apps I use are in the Amazon Appstore
- I paid $94 to get this without ads and to get the 32gb size - that's way cheaper than a comparable name brand tablet anywhere else (I'm looking at you Samsung & Apple!)
- There's an expandable memory slot - I have a 128gb micro SD card in there (It makes you format the card before you can use it)
- USB-C cord!!!!!! I don't know when Fires switched to this, but I'm glad they finally did
- Amazing battery life. I downloaded a whole bunch of shows and also reset a couple of times. Then downloaded again. After several hours of aggressive usage, it's still at 66%.

Cons
- Wow, this is slow. I'm comparing it to my phone, which is technically top of the line as of last November, and this is slow. It's also $1400 less than I paid for my phone, so while it's annoying, it's not enough to knock off a whole star.
- Can't fast charge. Not a huge issue because the battery is pretty big & I have to sleep sometime, but still.
- Can't download the one game I want from the Play store. Yes, I know that there's a way to do it, but it's annoying that it's not easy out of the box.
- Not all the customer service people know enough about this to help when you have issues. (Yeah, technically not the unit's fault, but as someone who was DM'ing with them for 2 hours yesterday and talked with 4 different people, I'm putting this con somewhere!)
- Can't save Prime Video content to the SD card. At least you can't download there. That's why I got the card. I'm not sure I can transfer Prime Videos between internal & SD yet. I think this is the same for all Amazon content.
- I kept getting ""service_error"" when I downloaded tv episodes that I had purchased, even when the episodes weren't on another device. According to Customer Service, you can only have them on 2 devices. I only had them on one, and I deleted them off that one, and I still kept getting the error.

TL;DR: This is a really, really good tablet, bordering on great FOR. THE. PRICE! The form factor is awesome for travel, and as long as you play in Amazon's sandbox, the experience is mostly good. I did have a lot of problems downloading episodes, which is actually why I bought this in the first place, and I don't like that you can't download Amazon content to the SD card. I'm not sure if there are legal reasons for that, but I don't like it.",positive
102,Computers & Accessories,"All-new Fire 7 tablet, 7” display, 16 GB, 30% faster processor, designed for entertainment, (2022 release), Black",$59.99,5,"I bought the 12th Gen Fire 7 (2022) because I wanted a: small, light weight, easy to carry, inexpensive, tablet on which to: read ebooks, play audible books, listen to music play simple game like solitaire, and occasionally watch a movie while traveling. This item does that, and only cost me $44.99 on sale for a 16GB model with ads. The screen res is not the highest, but I didn’t expect it to be. My movie watching will be limited to travel situations, and the res on this is good enough for that. When home, I watch movies on my 65” 4K TV. For action games, I play on my TV with a PlayStation console. Cameras on this Fire are good enough for snapshots to put in text messages / on social sites, and such. When I want better photos, I use my iPhone, or Nikon DSLR. The speaker on this Fire is minimal, but works well enough. I usually bypass it, by plugging in a headphone. That gives me better sound. The storage can be boosted with a micro SD card, which I have, and will get more of. In some ways, this Fire could have been better, but that would have made it more expensive. Overall, it does everything I want, and does it well. It took six days to arrive, which was what was expected. My previous Fire-a 5th Gen HD10, purchased in 2016-broke down, and needed to be replaced by something. That is what caused me to start shopping for a new Fire. I liked the way the 12th Gen Fire 7 seemed to fit my needs, so I bought it while it was on sale for $15.00 off it’s regular price. I have no complaints so far.",positive

The good:

Reading books is good on this Kindle.

Syncing from one device to another is still good for books. I also have a Paperwhite for those times when you just want something lighter when going out somewhere.

Nice and easy swipe-down icon menu. Great to turn off/on WIFI.

The bad:

The screen is skinnier than the Kindle Fire 7 HDX. Yes, it is.
Thanks for trimming the viewing area. (Sarcasm)

Connecting to my PC, but will not show any content.
Yes, I was using an Admin user on my PC. Checked for update for the driver.
Nothing.

Can't see anything on my Amazon cloud for games except one game. And yes, I can see everything on my old Kindle Fire 7 HDX.

Syncing books is good, and brought over one app. Did not transfer the game I was playing. Maybe this is not what it's supposed to do. (Yeah, this is a question is statement form)

Too many bells and whistles not needed on a small device. This is not a smart phone.
Do we really need Trending news? No.

Do we really need Search suggestions? No.

If you want to save battery time, disable WIFI. And yes, slow batter recharging. Thanks for being cheap with the essentials and packing in the ""stuff"" no one really wants or has use for.

Other:

I'll give it a week. Maybe I did receive a defective Kindle Fire 7 and need a replacement. I received my new Kindle Fire 7 (finally) on July 1, 2022. Maybe my love affair with Kindle Fire has come to an end.

Yeah, I mentioned I do have a Paperwhite. It's b/w, and boring looking, but it's an OK reader.

3 star review:

I upped the stars to 3.

The good, Part 2:

I got a call from Amazon Outreach Support. That was a good thing. Very helpful with Kindle to PC connection via USB.

Am able to connect the Kindle to my PC with success. Thanks for that, Support.

Trending in no longer on the For You screen. That's a plus.

The Bad, Part 2:

I'll review/repeat some of the things from Part 1.

Screen is about 1/4 inch leaner that Kindle 7 HDX.

My games from the cloud are not available. When I click on the one game that is showing while online, it takes me to the App Store/Game Store. And I won't click on that on the Game store because I'm not sure if I'll be charged again for the same game. (Yes, I know people are working on that. Hopefully before I have to make a decision on whether to keep this device.)

The nagging message under For You: Get back online to discover new videos, books, games and much more.

The nagging message under Library: Get back online to access all of your library content.

Redundant and pushy marketing messages, yes? Plus you can see if WIFI is running at the top/right of the screen. I don't believe we need two reminders, especially pushy reminders.

And Continue under For You is redundant. Why would we need the same book we're reading in two places? (Yes, I know we can Hide it.) Seems like For You section is a waste of space as we don't really need another device announcing the weather. We have those on our mobile devices/smart phones.

And finally, the list of recent apps. Another space waster. (Yes, I know we can get rid of those too.)

Not sure I want to keep this new Kindle 7 Fire 2022. I'm working with it, but........

Haven't been able to say those Four Little Words yet: I. Love. My. Kindle.

Part 3: Back to 2 stars

Maybe this Kindle Fire should be renamed Kindle Flicker.

Opening and closing books is not sharp.

Opening a book shows gray and then opens. *flicker*

Slow downloads. No, it's not my WIFI, it's the Kindle.

This will be a back up Kindle. Get my old Kindle Fire HDX's battery changed.

Why do we need 3 separate lists of our books when WIFI is running?
Why do we need a ""Continue"" section for the book we're reading?

Is this all space filler? It's annoyingly repetitive.

Get rid of the ""For You"" page. It's boring and Trending is marketing ads. Really! I thought I paid the ransom not to be marketed on my Kindle Flicker.

Come on people, it's not a 5 star Kindle product.

Clicking on the game that's not downloaded (yet and maybe never, because I don't want to go 10 rounds if I'm being charged for it again) and that I've paid for, takes me to the Game Store and not the cloud where all my games should be. Why?

COMING SOON! A 1 STAR REVIEW FOR THE KINDLE FLICKER!",negative
104,Computers & Accessories,"All-new Fire 7 tablet, 7” display, 16 GB, 30% faster processor, designed for entertainment, (2022 release), Black",$59.99,4,"For the price, this serves my needs. I primarily needed something to read books using Kindle. My phone screen was a bit too small. This is roughly the size of a paperback. It does look larger in the online photos.

The unit is very solid. A bit heavier than I expected, but would not add significantly to personal carry-on weight, and for me, suitably portable.

pros-
- inexpensive
- good enough screen resolution

cons-
- the battery drained faster than advertised, perhaps 5-6 hours
update: after more use, battery life appears to be 8-10 hours
- it is a bit slow loading books and videos, but not more than about 20 seconds, worst case so far
- there is apparently no low battery warning. Unit just goes dark
- it appears to me that browsing the internet drains the battery much faster than reading a book. Possibly the advertised battery lifetime is for reading a book?

I was at about 12% battery when browsing CNN for no more than 30 minutes, and the battery went to zero with no warning.

Because of the battery life, if you travel with this, make sure it is charged up going out the door. It should be fine on a long transit as long as you turn the unit off when not using it.

Again, it meets my personal needs, and you can't beat the price, so four stars overall.

Update: 7/8/2022:
I discovered that one cannot delete titles from your KU borrowing history within your AMAZON account, even after returning the book. Obviously this is a privacy concern as anyone who could get access to your account could review the books you've read. It looks like the only way to delete borrowing history, at least that which you see, is to cancel one's KU account. I have done this as a test, and it appears the borrowing history is deleted. I don't know if it is also deleted in AMAZON's records that I cannot see. In any case, I will restart my KU account at some point, but it is annoying that some privacy protection is only attainable by periodically canceling one's KU subscription.

Update: 7/13/2022
- I have found that battery life is now a bit longer 8-10 hours
- Unfortunately there are still privacy concerns with a KU account. I restarted my KU account after canceling to delete my borrowing record, but after restarting account, i found the past borrowing record was reinstated. So, there is no real privacy protection for a KU account other than your password. Hopefully, AMAZON will address this problem and allow users to fully erase items from a borrowing record.",positive

I suggest adding a pop socket on the back to help holding it. Loading speed is definitely much faster than Fire 7 (2019). It is very lightweight and portable in purses or small backpack. Love the USB-C change! I did try watching a few videos on it, and the color saturation is nice! To me, the color of videos I watched on Fire 7 (2019) tend to have this odd washed-out look.

Be aware that it is much smaller in comparison to Fire 7 2019. Literally almost the same size as a Kindle e-reader, so be aware of that. But for me, it is a perfect size because I'm using this Fire 7 (2022) strictly for reading only. The touch screen is not as responsive as how I'd like it to be, but with the price I paid for it, I don't have much expectations.

Majority who are disappointed with this product are mainly people who expect this product to be a high-performance tablet, which it is not. If you use this mainly just for kindle reading, watch Prime videos, and occasional web browsing, you'd be more than happy with this tablet.",positive

This tablet was an excellent price for my needs. I really only use the tablet to read e-books from my local library, although I know I can do MANY more things with it. I was a little worried about the 7"" display because my old tablet was an inch larger. Since the letter size can be adjusted, and since this size is lighter in weight and easier to hold, I have found that I like the 7"" size even better for reading than my old 8"" size! I decided to buy an inexpensive case from another seller; but I found out that I needed to know the ""generation"" of my new Fire. I felt that the information on the All-new Fire 7 didn't really give me the ""generation"" number in a clear, easy-to-find way. Finally, I did find out that this tablet is ""12th generation,"" and after that it was easy to find a case that would fit.

It's about as bare bones as you can get. Built around things associated with Jeff Bezos and Amazon. You'll have to use the Amz browser and, their app store which is very limited. I only use it to check email and light web surfing and it works fine for that. I've read reviews of people crying the blues about pop up this and that, I haven't had that experience? I get one ad when I first fire up the machine and, that's it, nothing (for me) to cry about. Again, don't have high expectations and, you should be just fine....",positive

The Fire 7 2022 model does that and more! I could argue that we could use a smaller device, like a 5.6 inch model (Similar to what Apple has for iPod touches).

The Fire 7 is great if you are looking to read on the go, consume Amazon ecosystem content, and have a device that can supplement your smartphone. I bring my Fire 7 with me to work and read during my lunch breaks.

There are some critiques I have about the device:
1. It is unclear if the device supports wireless charging or not. I tried putting this and my fire 8 model on wireless charging ports and they don't work. Amazon claims you need a ""built for Amazon"" wireless charging port. I will have to update my review when I get an answer.

2. The operating system can be laggy at times. Amazon needs to have a team dedicated to making their Fire OS more stable and faster. The OS has been around for years and it's still slow. Please figure out ways to make the OS faster.

3. Please give us an update that allows us to touch the screen to wake the device. Getting a magnetic case will fix this problem, but it would be nice to have a ""touch to wake"" ability.

Overall, Fire tablets are great for reading, studying, audible, and engaging with Amazon ecosystem content. The Fire 7 is a fantastic device, and I love being able to have a device that is small enough to bring with me to work and put in my pocket.

Bad Changes:

-Three colors: Black, Denim, Rose; 2019 version had four colors: Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage

==

Overall these are nice little upgrades to the least expensive Fire tablet line. The CPU and RAM upgrades bring this new Fire 7 up to par with the Fire HD 8 tablets, and the ability to add up to 1TB of storage is nice since these have so little onboard storage space. This 2022 version has the same cameras and display as the previous 2019 version, but the smaller bezel around the screen results in the tablet being smaller overall. I haven't tested out the battery life much yet, but an extra 3 hours of battery is also a big improvement if that holds up. These upgrades, combined with the USB-C charging, probably make the $10 extra price tag worth it; even more so if you can get this on a discount on Prime Day.

I feel like this Fire 7 is a good option as a starter tablet. The high durability and low price make it ideal for kids that are old enough to use a real tablet; but young enough that you'd worry about them damaging a more expensive option like an iPad. The resolution on this Fire 7 isn't amazing, but you can't really beat the price. If you want a better screen it might be worth upgrading to the HD 8.",positive
110,Computers & Accessories,"ASUS TUF Dash 15 (2022) Gaming Laptop, 15.6” 144Hz FHD Display, Intel Core i7-12650H, GeForce RTX 3060, 16GB DDR5, 512GB SSD, Thunderbolt 4, Thunderbolt 4, Windows 11 Home, Off Black, FX517ZM-AS73",$999.99,5,"This laptop is for someone who wants a laptop to take around and do productive work on and also play modern games at high settings. There are others with faster GPUS, but hardly any that can claim 6-9 hours of battery life like this one. There are tons of battery saving features, like a dedicated key to change what power profile to use. The 144hz screen auto sets to 60hz on battery so save battery life. Gaming on a AAA game at high settings, 30 fps, I get around 2-3 hours of battery life. Less demanding games can go more. Other contemporary laptops i've used can really only game for an hour or so while on battery. You can also set the battery life to be capped at 80% or 60% to extend it's usable life. I usually keep it on 80% and still have long battery life. And it comes in at a hell of a competitive price.

#CPU

The cpu is a bit lacking when compared to other 8 core laptops, but it's a good tradeoff for the lower TDP (and less power consumption). It is more than capable for most peoples work though. It cannot be undervolted like any new intel chip, which I did not know until researching it.

#GPU

The 3050ti has been able to run any game I throw at it on high settings, and older games can be ran easily on my 4k monitor and the native 4k resolution.
It can get fairly loud when gaming at high performance for awhile, I game with headphones so I don't notice it when i take them off. But this will be an issue for really any gaming laptop, especially one this thin.

#Ports
Thunderbolt 4 can be connected to external docks and external GPUS. Allows 100w usb c charging so you can run laptop off one cable, but keep in mind this is less than the 200w power brick, and if you are gaming at high performance, it will slowly drain the battery unless you also have the power cable connected. I also got a 50$ external 20000 mah battery with 65w usb charging which can bring the laptop from 10-80%. Nice!
It is annoying how the ports are all at least half way down the machine, as the top half is for the fan outputs.

#Upgradeability

There are 8gbs of ram soldered onto the board, and an additional slot, which I throw a 16gb stick in for 24gb. There is an additional m.2 slot which I put another 512gb ssd in. Speaking of which, the SSD is crazy fast. While looking up benchmarks for other laptops, this one easily beat them all. I don't remember exact numbers but it's there.

#Display

1080p, 144hz. Good color reproduction, and clear sharp images. Does not look washed out or anything. Not the brightest for working in sunlight though, but it's usable.
The screen cannot tilt back 180 degrees, more like 140 ish? I use a laptop stand so I cant have it as vertically tilted as I like, but for 99% of people this is a non issue. The hinges feel solid and don't seem like they will crap out or break off like other.

#Keyboard & Trackpad

The backlit keyboard (one color, changeable brightness with keyboard keys or using software, also has different modes like breathing) is solid. Key travel is not shallow and has a good click. I do not notice a difference in quality with my Mx master key keyboard.

The trackpad is decent. Not glass, but precise and not an annoying texture. Not much to say on it. It gets the job done.

#Design and build

It is marketed as a 'tough' laptop and while it doesn't feel much different from a normal laptop (and isn't metal, it's some sort of hard plastic polymer), I have had 0 damage in the 3 months i've owned it.
The Tuf Dash f15 is solid, yet lightweight and not annoying to lug around. It is thin and not too heavy, and has similar dimensions and weight of most high powered ultrabooks.

#Bugs Glitches & Software

This is the first laptop i've had where I have not encountered really any bugs or glitches. I have had BSOD but I am almost postive these are from the Dell TB16 thunderbolt dock i'm using. Even these have only happened 2 times in 3 months.
The laptop is ran off of Asus Armory Crate service, which has features such as profile switching, game optimziation, system tweaking and more. It can be accessed via a dedicated key. It is not super lightweight of a program, but not overly consuming either. You can close the program in task manager and the laptop will not have any issues, just some features are closed off.",positive

I've got a self-built desktop that uses numerous ASUS components, and have used their laptops in the past (my family business also bought a couple Vivobooks). The designs are usually top notch & well built. This one has a solid LCD housing without too-much flex. The battery life is reasonable for this system; the ""silent"" mode keeps things quiet & cool for non-gaming and non-video/audio production tasks. ""Performance"" mode (predictably) runs the battery down quickly but this mode is best used when connected to a power outlet. The fans are a little loud under heavy loads, but that's also to be expected in such a slim chassis. The speakers are competent but not stellar. The display has a great refresh rate & good viewing angles. I think the i7-12650H model was the right choice as it still gives you all 6 Performance Cores compared to the 12700H, you're losing 4 E-cores but as a mostly stationary/occasionally portable gaming system it's not really a loss. The TB4 & multiple USB ports (that don't block each other by being too close) are all USB 3 & up, no USB 2 here. My model has an SK Hynix Gold P31 SSD (512GB) & I'm plenty happy with that performance. I'll but putting in a second NVMe drive later since the slot on the board is open. Keyboard is good, the touchpad has an excellent feel & spacious.

I've used it with Windows 11 and Manjaro 21; it performance at the expected high level in both OSes.

No complaints, definitely worth it. It's a great system and I think you'll enjoy using it very much. If you can find it on a sale for $1100 (USD) then it's a definite buy over other brands' 15-inch models.

Para trabajos cotidianos esta sobrada.
Para juegos si nos subes todo al máximo o si lo haces pero juegas a 1080p, no da problemas en lo absoluto.

Contras que en lo personal veo:
Cuando estas realizando algo pesado, el cpu suele subir a los 90 grados, si tienes configurado que los ventiladores no suban a su máxima capacidad.
Eso por consiguiente hace que caliente mucho la parte de arriba del teclado, pero no es nada que no hagan otras portátiles.
Cuando los ventiladores suben por arriba de los 4000rpm el sonido de las elices es un poco fuerte.

Pros:
In my opinion, it is a good laptop for the price.
I mainly play valorant and league of legends, and both of those games run at a constant 160 fps when plugged in. Valorant boots up in 25 seconds, and it takes 10 seconds to load the training ground map, which I showcase in the attached video. Fortnite runs at about 120 fps on medium settings, and GTA runs at about 80. The 144hz refresh rate looks smooth and gaming on it is an enjoyable experience.

Cons:
No camera
I seriously dislike all the asus software that came preinstalled with the machine that they have made nearly impossible to remove. It’s caused my pc to blue-screen crash at least 10 times, and I don’t know if I trust the software.
The fans can get loud when they kick in. Keep this in mind if you’re doing some late night gaming and you’re Roomate is trying to sleep.

Neutral:
As with most (if not all) gaming laptops, don’t attempt play without being plugged in, or you won’t have a good time.
The battery life is alright for coding and video playing. I can get about 5 episodes of breaking bad in before it gets low.",positive

Also of note, this is my second purchase of the ASUS brand, the first one was also very reliable and has served me well, it was even dropped and lived to compute to this day. I upgraded to this computer due to my older ASUS (7 years old) could not handle the 4k video so well. (BTW, I am not referring to the cheap base models of ASUS, rather the gaming computers.

130,Computers & Accessories,Google Wifi - AC1200 - Mesh WiFi System - Wifi Router - 4500 Sq Ft Coverage - 3 pack,$149.99,5,"I had been an IT professional for over 40 years, and am now retired, but remain the IT professional for my household. In that time, I have had to set up many different routers to provide internet service for my home with multiple Alexa devices, Internet TV, and multiple PC's often running at the same time.

We have a large, 4500+ square ft., home with two stories and a basement. Our basement has 3 large rooms with concrete walls that have caused dead spots in most parts of the basement. Internet on the second floor works, but devices often need to be reconnect to establish a new connection. I have tried multiple internet extenders and access points that usually worked sporadically. Having to constantly reconnect them and reestablish a connect was frustrating, and I finally gave up on them.

I found out about the Google Mesh WIFI system and decided to look into them. I debated on the higher priced system that units include speakers and voice, but decided on this one since we have so many Alexa devices in our home. Another consideration was the cost of the upgraded system since 3 units costs 2 1/2 times more than this one. If you have a number of Google devices it may be worth the extra cost. All I wanted was a dependable WIFI system that would deliver WIFI to our entire house with no dead spots.

I am so happy that I chose this WIFI system. After I downloaded and installed the Google Home app, it took me all of 15 minutes to set up the system, and at least 10 of those minutes was used to find the best locations for the satellite units. The app really does it all. There was no setup of the ISP - it was just so simple anyone could set up this system with absolutely no knowledge of setting up a router. You don't have to fool with an internet connection to router software- it's all in the app. Just connect one unit to the Ethernet cable you would connect to the router and scan the QR code on the unit with your phone. After the router unit is connected, plug in the satellite units to electricity and select + at the top left of the screen in the app to add each satellite. I did notice that I had to wait until the light on the new unit stopped blinking and it was finished booting up before connecting. After all of the units are connected, you can check the connections of each and move the units to get the best connections to all of them. Since the Google Home app is also used for the upgraded system, there are a lot of options that don't apply to this system.

At this point, I couldn't be happier with this WIFI system. We now have fast internet in every corner of our house, including all of the rooms in the basement. I also tested the this system by taking one of my tablets out to the furthest end of our patio which is 60 feet from the router. I was still able to stream Netflix video with no lag. I should also mention that with this system and router, you don't have a choice on the connections between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The system automatically uses the 5 GHz connection unless the device is too far. Then it will automatically switch to the 2.4 GHz connection.

Knowing this is helpful if you need to initially connect a device that uses only 2.4 GHz. You need only to get far enough way from the router for it to switch the the 2.4 GHZ band. After the initial connection, the device will automatically connect to the 2.4 GHz band. When connecting a computer, you don't have to choose a band width, only your network name.

I am super happy with this WIFI system, and would highly recommend it. For the first time in years, we have internet service in every area of our house and for an extended area outdoors. Setup was so incredibly easy - so much easier than setting up a router. In addition, the WIFI signal is much better than ever before when checking it with the internet speed tests. Although we have been paying for 10 mbps download, previous to getting this system, our speed was 4-5 mbps. Now, we consistently get 7-9 mbps according to the speed tests. We watch internet TV and no longer have times the programs buffer. In addition, the TV doesn't cut out if we use the microwave. To-date, we have not had to restart any of the devices to get a WIFI signal on any of the 3 floors in our house.

UPDATE 8/10/21:
We have been using this system for over 2 months, and, to-date have not had to reboot any of the 3 modules. When watching TV (all internet apps), there has not been any buffering even when we use the microwave. The only minor problem I have had is in setting up a device that will connect only to a 2.4 GHz connection. Most peripherals now will use both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, so this usually isn't a problem. I did manage to get this device connected using the method described above. At this point, I am thrilled with the performance of this system. Since I am the techy in my house, this means less trouble shooting and less problems for me.

UPDATE 01/14/22:
We have been using this WIFI system for about 8 months, and I can now say that it is the best we have ever had. I have tried all of the ""high-end"" routers, and have never had the great connection to WIFI throughout the house that we have now. Since getting this system, I have rebooted the main router only once. With all other routers we have had, it was a regular thing. We use only internet services for our TV, and since getting this system, there has been absolutely no buffering problems. The WIFI signal reaches every part of our 3 story house, and our devices have not had to be reconnected because of connection problems. There are enough problems in life to spend time trying to resolve WIFI connection problems. It's so very nice to not have this problem anymore.

I hope this review was helpful for you. I will update this review if my opinion changes.",positive
131,Computers & Accessories,Google Wifi - AC1200 - Mesh WiFi System - Wifi Router - 4500 Sq Ft Coverage - 3 pack,$149.99,4,"Bought a 3-puck system to replace a router and 2 extenders. The setup of the new pucks was easy and straightforward. The first one I setup became the ""master"", and has a hardwire connection to the cable modem. The other two I setup are like extenders, but better, and they don't require their own networks. This is great, and it simplifies the later step of connecting WIFI-enabled devices. I also like that the basic setup includes 2.5 and 5 GHz bands automatically, again without requiring additional network names.
Once the pucks were setup (took about 30-40 minutes), I then began connecting my WIFI devices. Newer devices connected easily, but some of my older devices couldn't ""see"" the new network to connect to. Specifically, two older smart TVs and a first generation Chromecast had issues. After 3 days of research and fiddling with them I determined that the TVs were simply not going to work. I still don't know exactly why, but I think it was a hardware issue, not a software issue. I ended up connecting them by stringing network cables from the two extender pucks to the TVs. Of course, now I have to keep the TVs within cable-distance of the pucks. Or, I could upgrade the TVs. The Chromecast was perhaps more frustrating because there were instructions on the Internet for how to connect a 1st gen Chromecast, and I simply couldn't make it work. But on perhaps the 15th attempt, it worked. I don't think I did anything differently on that attempt. Go figure.
Now it all works great, and the network is much faster and more reliable. All in all, I'm very pleased. But I wish they didn't assume that everyone has all shiny new equipment. Many of us now have a house full of smart devices, and we can't afford to upgrade them all every 3 years. And I wish there was more vendor-provided support available to help those of us who have some older equipment. It shouldn't all be YouTube videos by people that have had the same problem and figured it out themselves. The vendors should bear more responsibility to test their stuff against what's out there and proactively provide help. It would eliminate a lot of frustration, and would provide a better customer experience.",positive

We had no issues setting up the devices and followed instructions as designed. One element was that our previous Wi-Fi subnet had a custom IP in which we had to come back and set the Google Home Wi-Fi router to the same subnet the old router had so that other devices like security system, ect which were hard coded with IP's do not lose connectivity.

The google home app is not too bad but you will need to dig into the setting to find how to manually change your IP subnet.

EVEN THOUGH AMAZON IS POSTING THIS IS AS A 32G BLACK**

A GREAT LITTLE TABLET FOR WHAT IT IS.

If you're a diehard Amazon customer like I am, then Amazon devices can't be beat for hooking one up to everything that Amazon World offers. And let's not forget Alexa makes it all even easier.

I never thought I'd need or buy a Fire tablet, since I'm already covered with a new laptop, Kindle Reader, 2 Android tablets, and a Samsung phone. My bases were already covered and my nearly 3,000 Kindle books were accessible in several ways. Prime Video and Music work great on all my existing devices, plus I have 2 regular Firesticks and 1 4K Firestick. So why get a Fire tablet?

Well, my two tablets were made obsolete for Kindle when Amazon recently SOMEHOW deregistered both of them from my account and I wasn't able to download the newest Kindle app and repopulate my library. Long story. Enter Fire Tablet HD 8 just when I needed a new device for the Kindle app and the Prime Day price was unbeatable ...

Buying the tablet was really a no-brainer, and a necessity at the time. I ordered the newest 64G WITH ADS and am ecstatic with that choice. After considerable research in comparing capabilities, the 8 was better than the 8 Plus or the 10"" tablet. I don't recommend going lower than 64G even though the 32G is less expensive and memory is expandable. That perk has never worked out well on any device, and we all know that music, movies, and books will gobble up memory faster than a cheetah runs. The white matte finish looks great, but there are things to know before you buy.

** LONG BATTERY LIFE: Surprisingly, I recharge this tablet ONCE EVERY 3 DAYS, despite having it turned on all day with WiFi, and doing alot of Kindle reading.

** SIMPLE OPERATION: After some glitches during setup, and a thorough investigation of the tablet and settings, operation was a snap.

** SETUP ISSUES: I had lots of setup issues due to the endless system updates that were necessary and had to be done in a certain way and order that I couldn't have done on my own even though I'm very savvy with electronics. THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS and it was confusing. That meant being on the phone with tech support to get it all squared away properly. If you're typically Android, this tablet IS NOT ANDROID. IT'S AMAZON. There are similarities, but it's an AMAZON DEVICE THROUGH AND THROUGH.

** SIDEWALK OPTION: Once set up, if you want to opt out of Sidewalk it's very easy within settings.

** ANDROID CONVERTIBLE: For those concerned that it isn't Android and can't download Google Play apps, just go on line for easy instructions on downloading 4 APK files and a launcher in order to turn the tablet into Android and download any apps you want, then create a separate home screen for the Android apps. The current screen is all Amazon apps. Once done, you'll have the best of both worlds combined.

** QUIRKY GLITCHES: I've only had the tablet a few weeks and already there are glitches. The screen occasionally freezes, won't respond to touch, or pages won't open or navigate properly. If you're a heavy reader like I am with an extensive Kindle library and also frequently use Goodreads, there are more glitches. The books that you have ""read"" do not always synch into your GR account on the tablet. My ""friend"" count on GR is also incorrect. GR notifications are spotty. It helps that I double check on my phone app and also email, which are both accurate and up to date on GR notifications.

** A BRICK: Heavier than expected. If you're used to Samsung or Apple, this tablet will feel like a brick and also a bit thick. Expected it to be slimmer and lighter in design.

** SCREEN QUALITY: Picture quality not as sharp or good for movies as my Samsung. You'll notice the difference, but it's still good enough.

** DIFFERENCES: Amazon versions of apps are not quite the same as Android versions. Microphone dictation Notes and Highlights on Kindle books sucks. It doesn't understand most words you say, and you need to close and re-open the microphone to repeat. Very cumbersome and ineffective. This feature works flawlessly on Android, but I often have to type notes manually when I get fed up with the wonky microphone. The whole page layout of books in Kindle App is a bit spotty. Noticed a big difference in the way the Tablet Kindle App operates as opposed to Google Play version on an Android device. Sometimes, I get fed up with the issues, and just read for awhile on my phone when I want to do lots of highlights and notes on a book for reviews.

** DON'T BE AFRAID TO GET THE TABLET ""WITH ADS""! You'll save $15, and can pay it back later if you want the ads removed. The ONLY time I see ads is when I first turn on the tablet on the opening screen. That's it. See my photo of the book ad. No other ads appear during use or at the bottom of the screen as with my Kindle Reader. It's more of a screen saver that swipes away. As long as you are on the tablet and the screen doesn't go dark, no new or additional ads will appear.

** TOUCH SCREEN RESPONSIVENESS: The screen doesn't always respond. Locks up. Not sure if this will get worse or ""it is what it is"". NOT an issue that I have with Android.

** DIFFERENT LAYOUTS: Amazon Prime Video not laid out the same as Android. I couldn't even find my Watch List, until I noticed my profile icon and ""My Stuff"" at bottom of the screen. Why so different Amazon?

** ADJUSTMENT PERIOD: This tablet will take some adjustment, especially if comparing to Android. Although it's geared for Amazon apps, there are more glitches than I prefer, the same as has been happening with all the recent website feature changes on the PC.

It's an okay tablet and perfectly functional especially for Kindle books, music, and Prime Video if you have those subscriptions. 1st 6 months of Washington Post is free. Personally, the tablet needs some improvements and is adequate, but a bit less than expected. It's not the ideal option if you want Android capability, but remember that it is convertible. Because I bought it on Prime Day, I also got a free 3-month, first-time subscription to Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN. I see that offer is still available in another way on Amazon that still might apply to this purchase, so if you're thinking of buying be sure to check the promo with customer service first.

Overall, I'm happy with the tablet, the memory, and the functionality of Amazon World in general which I navigate on a daily basis, but there are some limitations from an android standpoint.

FYI: My photos show the main screen with pre-loaded Amazon apps, an example of a ""free ad"", and one with the Prime Video screen.",positive
181,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 tablet, 8"" HD display, 32 GB, latest model (2020 release), designed for portable entertainment, Twilight Blue",$69.99,2,"Device: Kindle Fire 8 (10th Generation)

I purchased 8 of these Fire tablets for use in an elementary classroom. They were to be used exclusively to access the Myon ereader app through our district’s Clever page. Sounded simple enough! Yet, I have had the most frustrating experience with educational technology I have ever had.

First, I set up a child’s profile so that I could limit what the students had access to. The child’s profile comes preloaded with 100 videos/apps on the home screen! It was insane! (Note that this is not the “Kids” Fire, just a regular one with a child profile set up.) It took 4 different customer serv agents and about 3 hours to finally find someone who could tell me how to turn them off. It ended up being a simple toggle, so how could that many people not know how? (This was after I had searched through multiple threads online from frustrated parents with the same issue.) FYI, in the child’s profile, toggle off the option to Enable web access. However, this means that you will then have to go in an Allow Content for every app that you do want them to access as well as allow every web page they can go to. For me, not a huge deal because I bought these for one specific purpose, but as you will see below, even that was a ridiculously frustrating process.

After figuring out the toggle solution, I started going into the settings of each Kindle to set them up. On the 8th and final Kindle, it didn’t work. After restarting and then trying to power off/wait/power on, I finally decided to delete the profile and reinstall it. Upon doing this, the child profile interfaces of ALL 8 tablets completely changed. The original wallpaper/setup was single solid light blue page with cloud outline in background. After I reinstalled the profile, the wallpaper was a black/aqua/purple paint splatter with a “For Me”, “Home”, and some other tab. Under the For Me tab were ALL the videos and apps that I had disabled access to. Even though the toggle was set to disable, they were all back and could be opened. I then factory reset the device, and it still didn’t work. I finally tried to create yet another new child profile, and then it finally went back. No rhyme or reason.

So, now to the task of setting them up for Myon. I downloaded the Myon app, but it would not work. I think this was an issue on our district permission side. (And even though I did a press/hold and told it to remove the app from the profile and then completely deleted Myon from my account via the Content and Devices setting of my Amazon.com account, it was still showing up! And if the child tapped it, it became stuck in a loop of trying to install an app that was no longer there.) Anyway, I was told by our Academic Tech dept to go through the Clever app. Guess what – it’s not available on the Amazon app store. So, I had to go through the web. In the Allow Content section of Settings, you can allow specific websites, which is great. However, even though I allowed the website to access Clever, at every step, the child’s profile web browser said no permission. I had to enable every single page the kids will go through to get to their Myon account, and even then they have to know to navigate around an “Uh oh” page that still pops up every time, even though I allowed it.

Because of this, I needed to make step-by-step instructions by taking screenshots so I could print for the kids so they could remember all these steps. However, screenshots taken while in child’s profile cannot be located anywhere, not in the child or adult profiles. (Camera and photo storage had been enabled.) Regular photos taken with the camera could be found in the photos app, and I found an online thread suggesting going through the Files app, but they are nowhere to be found. I can’t take the screenshots in the adult profile because the screen looks completely different. I spent 20 minutes on chat with a CSR this morning only to be told he would ‘notify the team.’ The threads I read about this same issue were from 2020 and 2021, so I’m sure they know and have chosen not to fix it.

My multiple chat sessions were also frustrating. With this particular one, I took the time to write out, in detail, the exact steps I followed, only to have him ask – two separate times - if I had tried something that I had already said I tried. I had this same issue with other CSR chats. These are the least knowledgeable CSRs I have ever dealt with. One, named Jestin, kept telling me to tap the Menu button, and there was not a menu button on my screen. After hanging up with her, I continued to research online, and found the exact script she was using, and it was for a Kindle eReader, not a Fire! She didn’t even have the right device, and she kept getting very angry with me when I couldn’t follow her instructions. She kept me on hold for 10 minutes when I asked to speak with someone else, then came back on and (unsurprisingly) said she couldn’t find anyone else.

I usually have great customer service with Amazon, but they have truly failed with their training related to the Kindle Fire devices. They would have me wait for 10 minutes sometimes, only to come back and ask me to try something that I had already told them I tried.

Almost every single thing I have tried to do with these has required me to spend an inordinate amount of time researching previous threads, chatting online with a specialist, or on the phone. It took 3 separate calls to finally get someone who was willing to take over my Fire so they could see what I was seeing, and even so, I still cannot use them in the way that I need to. You definitely get what you pay for, I guess. Such a shame when teachers have to use their own money to provide these opportunities for their students. I have wasted hours of my time and a lot of my money. I hope I can save another teacher some of this endless frustration.",negative
182,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 tablet, 8"" HD display, 32 GB, latest model (2020 release), designed for portable entertainment, Twilight Blue",$69.99,3,"I was looking for a wall-mounted pad to centralize and control my Alexa-based smart home. For the price, you can't beat it, but it's a hack (at best) with mixed results. The HD8 is a perfect size for this kind of application.

There are several aftermarket wall mounts, I'm very happy with the one I got, but I did need to saw it to get access to the volume controls. You will need to access them frequently so look for a mount with exposed volume buttons. My mount has wired USB power but there are several options from POE to mains on most available 3rd party mounts.

Smart Home Dashboard:

The ""show mode"" has a dedicated button on the lower task bar which is handy, but it only surfaces ~50% of your smart devices and lacks support for groups, routines and other functionality. You'll still need to launch the native Alexa App to have the needed functionality. The native Alexa App is UGLY on this device as compared to the stock android version. It can only show in white (light theme), and it's missing a GUI — it looks like a 1990's HTML web page that doesn't have CSS support.

The main challenges I'll share are two-fold; making the user experience streamlined, and integrating with media playback.

User Experience

Shovelware! The price is low because this is jam-pact with marketing shovelware, everything is crammed with upsells, recommendations, and tons of clutter. Getting the GUI to be simple and intuitive requires a lot of setup config to systematically remove all the clutter, but it is possible with dedication. The stock desktop backgrounds are all bright and busy, I had to link to my Amazon photos and upload a solid grey image to replace the crazy graphics because there are no solid color stock backgrounds available in the settings.

There's an upsell when you buy the pad to ""remove lock-screen ads"" you absolutely should buy that option unless you want a crazy distracting flashing panel on your wall.

I suggest enabling the recent apps ""continue"" option on the homescreen setting that creates a large UI component with the last 6 apps used. Much easier to see than a cluster of small icons spread over the desktop. This is a great feature and should be developed more. In my application as a smart home dashboard, 6 featured apps are more than enough.

Media Playback

The speakers on the pad are tiny and cheap, you'll need to bluetooth or hard-wire from the headphone jack to get any acceptable sound. It supports the Alexa multi-room speaker groups feature, but you'll need to add the phrase ""play XXX on the XXX group"" everytime you ask for audio playback, and limit yourself to only a few Amazon sanctioned music services, I think that's a really terrible user experience.

You can bluetooth to another Echo speaker, but if that speaker is set up as a stereo pair, you'll only get it to play on one, not both. Basicly the media playback functionality is sub par and needs a lot of work.

For my application, I elected NOT to use the pad for the Alexa/music speaker group support and instead bluetooth it to my network Yamaha receiver. This decision was partly because I use the PLEX app to serve my home media needs, and the PLEX skill only works locally on any given Alexa device and is blocked from using speaker groups. I'd need to enjoy my music on the tablet's 1/4"" speakers, or bluetooth to an external device.

To complicate matters further this solution required me to use the Yamaha AV Controller android app to remotely choose inputs and receiver volume or—I'd need to run back to the media hub to change the receiver settings defeating the purpose of a remote pad.

Unfortunately, the Yamaha AV Controller android app is not available in the Fire Appstore as is typical with all other audio-gear manufacturer apps. The Fire App Store is for your children. It's only has super-basic apps but with thousands of games for kids—little for the grown-ups—and none for my purpose.

I won't advocate that you violate the Amazon terms of service, but I was able to get the Yamaha AV Controller android app installed after some research and effort. I don't suggest you try this unless you're comfortable with android system alterations, but it is possible to put Google Play Services on the pad with the full play store app catalog. We'll see how long it works until future Fire updates break it.

Bottom Line

Pros:

—Price
—3rd party mounting options

Cons:

—Shovelware!!
—Lack of full device support in ""show mode""
—Ugly native Alexa app
—Sub-par media connectivity
—Limited to Amazon-sanctioned music services
—App store lacking apps for grown-ups
—Limited config/UI options

Someday Amazon will evolve their Echo hardware with added 5.1 abilities and I'll likely toss my receiver in favor of a native 5.1 Echo solution. Running two independent sound systems, with two independent speaker sets isn't a great experience, but clearly Amazon is working towards a better home media environment. They will need to have support non-amazon music/media services, especially local playback services like PLEX as any ""owned"" media is currently blocked in their ecosystem, like many others, I'm not happy paying monthly service fees to rent the media I already own and Amazon has stopped allowing user uploads to their music services—only Amazon-purchased music is available. Nope, not a usable solution!

Even with all the limitations, I believe it's a tortured but acceptable solution for a centralized dashboard if you're willing to do what it takes to get it to look and function properly.

Good luck!",fair

The first was a gift from my last job and was an Amazon Fire 7 2017 edition. It was, as one would expect from a cheap tablet, very slow and low quality. However, it was still a great tablet for the price. I believe that they were running somewhere around $50-$75 at the time I received it and regardless of the quality, it worked far better than any smartphone I had seen around the same price. I was able to expand memory and I used it for personal and professional services for almost 4 years. So it definitely served its purpose. Last year my wife was tired of me always complaining about how slow it had gotten and how limited it was on being able to keep up with newer apps. So she bought me an Amazon Fire HD 8 2021 for Christmas in the hopes that it would fix the issues I was having with my 2017 model. That brings me to the real point of this review. Having used this tablet for almost a year now I can say again that this is an excellent tablet for the price. I only have a few complaints that I was hoping Amazon had fixed since the 2017 model.

1) The screen is just not bright enough. It's fine when you are inside in a low light area but when you walk outside, especially on a sunny day, you can't see anything on the screen. That's with the brightness level at max and adaptive brightness turned off. (Wanted to clarify for those of you who might think I don't know what I'm doing)
2) The screen lags when switching between apps and when loading apps. This was a major problem with the 2017 Fire 7 but I had hoped that, with all of Amazon's internal hardware and software upgrades that it would be faster but it's about the same still. It's just definitely not made for multi-tasking or gaming really. You can multi-task but it's difficult due to the lag. However, it's a great option for those of you who just want to binge watch your favorite movies and shows on streaming apps and/or use it for ebooks, music, or shopping.
3) The battery life is about the same as my 2017 which was also very disappointing. On a full charge I can usually get about 4-5 hours of solid use before it's almost dead (that was brand new), about 8-10 hours of intermittent use, and if left on but inactive (on standby) you can get up to 3 days on a full charge before it dies. However I will also say that those numbers have not decreased much, if any, over the past 8 months of use. So at least the battery life seems to be fairly consistent.
4) While the tablet is very ""user friendly"", it's not very good for those of you who like to poke around the more technical side of things. You basically have to download a bunch of secondary apps to read or change deeper settings than what you see on the basic menu.

*IMPORTANT NOTICE*
You should never change or alter the programming of any device. Doing this can damage your device, void manufacturer warranties, and may even be illegal in some cases. So make sure you know what the manufacturer as well as your local and federal law allows before you do anything that can alter or potentially harm your device. All repairs, alterations, and any other changes should always be handled by the manufacturer or other industry professionals who are trained to work on your specific device.

To sum it all up, remember that this is a cheap tablet so don't expect your Fire to keep up with the latest iPad because it can't. That being said, it really is a good tablet overall.
Especially when you consider that the closest thing to it from another company would cost you at least twice as much. So for the very last time I'll say, it's an excellent tablet for the price! Thank you",fair

I reluctantly started using it & my daughter told me ways to get Books for Free &/or really good deals on books from my favorite authors or genres (BookBub & EarlyBird I think - she tracks them for me - otherwise I would wind up getting every deal that popped up) ... I filled it up in no time & it just recently died on me ... My daughter assured me ALL my books were not lost (she tried explaining about them being in clouds but I don't do computers) ... She helped me pick out a replacement Kindle Fire & suggested I get one with more storage because I already own hundreds of books ... I liked this one - plus it came in a pretty color ... When I received it my daughter easily walked me through ""restoring"" ALL of my Books & things that I had before on my old tablet onto my New tablet ... Once this was done I was pleased with how much faster I could download new books & with how much more storage I still have available (I had to delete books off my old one if I wanted a new one) ... She showed me how I can turn it long ways (like a wide-screen tv) & helped me adjust my font & brightness - so now Reading is even more enjoyable than ever ... I also got the 3 year accident protection (just in case - I am 83 after all) ...
I Highly recommend this Kindle Fire to everyone ... including stubborn old timers like me ... If you don't have someone to help you set it up (like my daughter) - that's OK too because Amazon has Wonderful Customer Service & they will be happy to help you set it up at no extra charge (they can even take control of your screen to help fix things - But Only if You give them permission - they have helped me several times this way) ... So if your not sure about these things - But Love to read as much as I do ... I say ""For the Love of Reading Take the Chance"" ... I think you'll find yourself as pleasantly surprised as I have been (I can take a whole book series with me in one hand ... WooHoo!) ...

The old one still functions great after five years, but I felt an upgrade was in order, so opted for one the same size. I decided not to go with the bigger model simply because I already had something in that size in the form of my iPad, and going with a bigger one would defeat my reason for going smaller and lighter. So far I've been extremely happy with it. While it's no speed demon, I didn't buy it for that, so I'm very happy with its performance. The big key I see in being happy with this is using it for what it's intended for and not as an iPad type replacement. If you're looking for a speedy platform that can handle all sorts of video play, then this is not for you. If you want something that will handle book reading, watching Prime videos on, or just playing some games, then you will not go wrong with this. The price is hard to beat for what you're getting.

186,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 tablet, 8"" HD display, 32 GB, latest model (2020 release), designed for portable entertainment, Twilight Blue",$69.99,4,"It's not an iPad. It's not a Samsung tablet. It has some inherent limitations, but for the price, it ain't bad.

The Kindle Fire HD is a tablet. It was designed to be an entry point into Amazon-world, and it is optimized for shopping, games and entertainment (streaming). But it can do a lot more as long as the user understands its limitations.

The biggest limitation is that it is connectable ONLY via Wifi, so anything that you want to do that requires an interface to the Internet requires that you be within range of an accessible Wifi hub. That mean you can't web-surf or stream a video at a campsite in the woods. But it's just as responsive on our home Wifi as my wife's iPad or my iPhone.

The Kindle Fire uses Amazon's proprietary version of the Android operating system, so its basic functionality will be familiar if you are accustomed to an Android phone. However, it also means that the normal channel for obtaining apps is via the Amazon app store. Like Google Play and the Apple App store, the selection of apps is pretty extensive. However, the Amazon collection is limited in some areas - eg, the on-line apps for many local banks aren't available.

While it is not possible to download apps from Google Play to the Kindle Fire directly out of the box, there is a way to augment the basic offering so that apps can be retrieved from Google. Do a Google search for installing the Google Play Store on a Kindle Fire - note that the instructions are a little involved and must be followed carefully.

There are a number of basic apps included on the device - none of which can be removed. Some are simply other versions of more familiar apps. For example, the native browser is Silk - seemingly different from Firefox or Google, but with much the same functionality. Likewise, the native map app is actually Here - which is highly respected in many countries outside North America. After devoting a little 'play time' to these, I found that they are quite usable. Apps that you don't need/want can be clustered in an 'Unused App' folder so that they don't clutter up the screen. E-mail works well.

The price is very attractive, and I was surprised at the apparent build quality - to my mind, it compares very favorably with an iPad. Only time will tell how it holds up. The screen is bright. Sound is ok but if you want higher quality audio, I suspect that you could use the built-in Bluetooth to link to an external audio system.",positive
187,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 tablet, 8"" HD display, 32 GB, latest model (2020 release), designed for portable entertainment, Twilight Blue",$69.99,5,"Right up front I want to address the negative reviews that tarnish this product because, as usual, people buy this at a very budget price and expect an iPad or Samsung Tablet. It is NOT an iPad or Samsung, it is an Amazon content delivery device. It is inexpensive because Amazon provides the content and they want you to have a cheap way to enjoy it. It is an E Reader, Music Player, Video Player not a full fledged Android Tablet. Like most Amazon devices it has ads on the lock screen. Any other ads are the fault of the apps. It can be massaged to load apps from Google Play but it wasn't designed for that and results will vary. Expecting this to perform like an iPad or Samsung is wishful thinking of the highest degree. If you can't afford an iPad, don't blame this unit. Don't buy it to do anything but read, listen and watch. I've worn out several of the Fire units over the years and I loved them. They are electronic devices and as such are likely to fail at some point. It's reality. I own 2 iPads as well as This Kindle, an old fire (USB port finally died) and a Kindle Paperwhite. They all serve a purpose. I read constantly and sometimes the Paperwhite is right, Sometimes the Fire is right. The iPads are PC replacements for me and do everything I need to run a small business and record music. I don't expect any of the Kindles to be iPads. Warranty is commensurate with value. 90 days is enough to verify operation. After 90 days you're just unlucky or you dropped the unit so many times it gave up. iPads have a 1 year warranty and you pay for it. My last iPad cost me over $500. I expect a lot more from it than I do a Kindle. I apologize for ranting but it sucks that good products suffer because of bad expectations. A Kindle Fire is a great device for what it was intended to do. I don't really like backlit screens for reading, but sometimes they're desirable. I can watch Movies, Listen to Audiobooks, Listen to music, Stream content and read books and magazines. All on one device that has a screen I don't have to squint at to enjoy. All for a very reasonable price. I had some A-hole grab my fire and run while I was getting a drink refill and it wasn't a nightmare... like if he had run off with my iPad.

We enjoyed it for many years. Mostly reading, but also some streaming, games, and internet. The micro-usb port finally failed and we couldn't charge it without doing ""charging cable yoga.""
This new unit has a few ups and downs: UPs: The device is much lighter and easier to hold than the old one. The screen is bright and responsive. It has lots of features for use as a tablet beyond just reading that allow it to compete with Samsung Tab and iPad. DOWNs: The battery does not seem to last as long in the new version. This may help make it lighter, but for moderate use, you will need to charge daily (before, my wife plugged in the old one every few days). Ad-supported price. We got this one for an incredible deal during Prime Day. In the smaller print, the price is Ad-supported, so customer directed ads would appear on the lock screen. Not too bad, but my wife didn't like, so we had to pay Amazon the $15 ransom to remove the ads. (on the up-side, the $15 is a one-time charge, not a subscription).
We are currently having some trouble with a feature that alerts you if moisture has entered the charging port. We keep getting the alert even if the fire tablet has not been near any liquid. I have to do a little more research on that. it may have a defect.
The last comment is that the swipe navigation is a little less intuitive to us than the old device. we are still learning it, so sometimes it can be a little frustrating to get to the screen we want-just like my iPhone!",positive
189,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 tablet, 8"" HD display, 32 GB, latest model (2020 release), designed for portable entertainment, Twilight Blue",$69.99,5,"...don't get one if you already own an iPad! Let me explain.

Everything I can do on a Kindle Fire, I can do on my iPad better. Reading, streaming, e-mails, social media, games... literally everything. The OS on the Fire tablet is clunky in comparison. Even the virtual keyboard doesn't work as well for me.

Oh, and with the Alexa enabled on the Fire, when I use it in the same room as an Echo (which is everywhere in my house), they don't work together very well. I'll say ""Alexa, display the weather on my Kindle Fire,"" my Echo briefly lights up, makes a low beep, and says nothing. The weather doesn't display on my Fire.

Right now my Fire tablet is mounted as a display for showing me the time and weather, and I rarely pick it up anymore. It's essentially an Echo Show now. Maybe if I were going somewhere and was afraid my iPad would get stolen or damaged, I'd take it with me. But I have a Kindle Paperwhite too, and I'd rather have that stolen or damaged than my Fire.

If you've never had an iPad and you want a solid tablet device, by all means save money and get a Fire tablet. But my iPads (I've had 3 so far) have totally spoiled me! I now read from my Kindle library on my iPad's Kindle app. It's much easier to use than reading on the Fire. The Fire's user interface is slow & clumsy. There's a reason the Kindle tablets are priced much lower than an iPad's. My sling bag feels much lighter without both my iPad and Fire since I started leaving my Fire at home every day.

I haven't tested the webcam and microphone yet.

I don't play new or graphic-intensive games, but this ran very well on older games (Team Fortress 2, Spec Ops: The Line, Magic the Gathering 2014) and some newer ones (Deep Rock Galactic). I plan to run Halo Infinite and Outer Wilds later this week and expect it to perform well.

I will keep this updated as my time with this computer progresses. 5/5

OLD REVIEW (20 March 2022):

TL;DR - I'm sure the laptop is great but the one I received is defective (can't charge - motherboard issue). I am returning it to Amazon and have ordered another one, as I'm sure a functioning unit will meet my expectations for this product. I will update my review when my second order arrives. As for now, 1 star for defective product.

I wanted a budget gaming laptop to replace my retired ASUS G55VW (2011). I chose this model due to its strong specs for a budget device, including an RTX 3050Ti (midrange for graphics cards in 2021 but supports the burgeoning ray-tracing technology used in current games), Core i7 CPU, 1 TB SSD storage, and 16GB memory. I also chose this because I wanted a 17-inch screen. The price point maxed out my acceptable budget range (~$1200).

I believe this laptop is a good choice for me considering these specs and the price, and I look forward to trying it out.

HOWEVER, the model I received appears to be defective - I believe I got a lemon. Upon unboxing, plugging the charger into the laptop did not illuminate the 'charging' light on the laptop, even after trying different electrical outlets and surge protectors. I took it to a local computer repair shop and the tech confirmed the charger itself was functional, as his voltmeter reported 19+ V. Upon opening the device and testing it, he concluded that something was wrong with the motherboard that prevented charging (I am unfamiliar with computers and cannot relay the significance of what he said).

I filed for a return-and-replace with Amazon; they accepted the return but denied the replacement - likely so I couldn't keep both laptops and run. The laptop is currently repackaged and I will drop it off at UPS for a return in the next couple of days.

I immediately ordered another unit, as this model was my first choice. I expect the second product to work just fine and meet my purchasing expectations, and eagerly await its arrival. I understand defective products are produced and shipped as a natural part of the production process, and do not consider this representative of Acer.

While I'm sure the product will meet my expectations, I am saddened to receive a defective model. I will provide an updated review when my second order arrives.",positive

I’ve been on Xbox for a long time for gaming and wanted to see the hype behind PC gaming. I do many things with my computer that a desktop would not work for me, as I have to move it around frequently and like portability, so I explored into the gaming laptop world. This was a cheaper, yet good option for an entry level Device.

Processor- I bought the i7-11800H model and this processor seems to be a bit overkill for even some higher end games. But it’s great to have that extra power to multitask as well. I have not had any issues with the processing power. It’s fast and smooth.

Graphics- I’m using the RTX-3050Ti and I’ve seen the card likes to run at 100% nearly all the time when in a game but I have had no issues with its capability of running smoothly and not overheating, and I haven’t even tried any undervolting yet which could improve it more.

RAM- the 16gb ram and 4gb vram work well together. I use the heavily graphic related game of BeamNG Drive that requires a lot of RAM to run smooth and have tried several multiplayer games and have never seen the RAM get over 70% (which is pretty good for heavily demanding games). This was Plenty of RAM for the gaming I do to keep it running smooth.

Overall- this is a great starting laptop for anyone looking for a gaming laptop or something fast for multitasking. Sure there might be a couple other options with similar price ranges that might perform slightly better. But this one was the lowest price I saw for what you get out of it and it’s been working just fine for me. I haven’t had it long so I may be back to update this if my opinion changes lol. But first impressions were really good.

Negatives- the graphics card works really great as mentioned above, but if you use it running at 100% for a couple hours you can completely notice a performance drop because the temperature starts to get too hot. I haven’t had it overheat but I have had some slight performance differences after a while of hard use. That’s really the only “issue”, that’s not a huge deal, that I’ve had. And it’s correctable by changing up some deeper settings.

As I have mentioned, this is a great ENTRY Level laptop. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone that is heavily into gaming. It works great for what I want to do with it but it would work pretty bad for a professional gamer (not that pros would ever use a laptop for gaming lol). I am also newer to PC gaming but I’m pretty savvy with computers. So being able to change some settings that the average newer user wouldn’t know how to, without YouTube tutorials, have made this laptop perform a little better than out of the box. But these changes I made so far are all settings included on the computer, not third party software included in this review (meaning anyone can change the basic settings to improve the performance slightly as I have).

PS- I thought I had a dead laptop when it came like other reviewers complained about. I read the review of one person that said you have to jam the power plug in there really good til it clicks for it to work. I initially thought I pushed hard enough and heard a light snapping sound, but it wouldn’t charge or turn on. So I pushed a lot harder and heard it click a lot louder and it started charging perfectly fine and started up right away.",positive

Wrong! press and hold the F2 key and then push the power button. Bonus feature - pressing the F2 key at the logo does a fast boot.
I have one major complaint with the laptop and that is the red lettering on the black keys, even with back lighting on it is still hard to see some keys. I find it easier to use a seperate keyboard and trackball. My only other issue is Win11. I may at some time go back to Win10 to see an end to cronic updates in a couple of years.

UPDATED REVIEW : 28 August 2022
------------------------
Regret.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but definitely once you hit its limitations.

TLDR : Child can never have their own Amazon account without credit card information and proof of residence in THEIR name. So you can never buy apps on their own account for later use. Apps are non-transferable. #Regret

My kiddo has a Furby Connect toy, the app will not work in kids mode as it requires location services to be active. There is no override for this. Other apps we wanted to install were also complaining. We were also wanting to purchase apps which would have a longer lifespan and any in-app purchases on the actual child account will be lost as they age and obtain their own account anyway.

Other issues with the kids mode, the tablet grows considerably slower with time, adding in an SD card still triggers an error about the tablet being full even though there is room, you just have to say ok and try to ""ignore"" it.

So, easy fix right?
Set up an account for the child, load account with gift card, for the games which that were played the most on Kids+ - purchase those apps on the new account, lock everything down with an external app such as Kaspersky Kids.

Step 1. Create Gmail account purely for use on tablet

Step 2. Factory Reset tablet to set up with single ""adult"" account

Step 3. Create Amazon account for child

Step 4. Spend considerable time and effort setting up tablet with already purchased apps from Google Play and other free apps from the Amazon App store.

Step 5. Lastly, add Credit card for purchases on Amazon account.
Purchase first app on tablet.
Amazon Account locked.

Unusual activity detected on account.
Please wait 24H for someone to be in contact.
Wut ?

Tablet is completely inaccessible.

Right ok so ...

Step 4. Factory reset....

Step 5. Make another account for child.

Step 6. Spend the rest of the day setting up the account.

Step 7. Buy $25 gift card for new account with your own Amazon account

Step 8. Redeem $25 gift code on account for tablet

Step 9. Things seem to be working fine. Child asks for one more app she used to enjoy.
Try to add app.

Step 9. Account locked.

Unusual activity detected on account.
Please wait 24H for someone to be in contact.

.... wa wa wa.

Step 10. Contact Amazon Support.

- Be transferred to Kindle Support

- Beg and Please for Amazon to unlock tablet account for child.
-- Support person asks if I had already redeemed the voucher

// About to answer ""Yes""
// Browser update force closes browser, minor cursing.

- Resume chat (Thank a higher power for that)
-- Assigned new kindle support person.

- New support person claims to read chat.

The new support person wasn't even understanding my problem, I needed the account unlocked and they started to talk me through doing a factory reset.

At this point I lost my cool.

Expletives were expressed.

Tagged out and other half tags in.

Chat goes around in circles whilst Amazon requests that we send in Proof of Address and Credit Card information for the account holder and the explanation of ""Child is 4 and does not have a credit card, or actual proof of address for that matter, we are the parents, why can we not just enter our card information?""

We are told to submit the information and wait 24H.

Obviously my child does not own a credit card or receive any bills in their name and therefore this becomes an unsolvable paradox. I am now sitting with a locked account I can't unlock and a redeemed $25 gift card redeemed on that account as well. This is nothing short of BLATANT THEFT.

Step .......
OMG. Don't do it, just don't.

We went the very next day and purchased an Samsung A7 Lite instead.
Huawei would have been the better choice due to Samsung's bloatware, but thanks to their fragile stance with the Google Play store, they are best left alone for now.

For those interested in my original, higher rated review, find that below...

PREVIOUS REVIEW : June 13, 2021
------------------------
Amazing -- Provided You Have No Interest In Previous In-App Purchases

It's amazing! So what's to dislike?

Well not much tbh, but I've mentioned two reasons below, so you can decide for yourselves whether or not this would be a deal breaker for you.

TLDR;
CONS
#1 -- No extension option on lock
#2 -- No support of previous in-app purchases

PROS
#1 -- Interface that adjusts to age range
#2 -- Full parental control and remote access to tablet through Amazon account
#3 -- Year free of Kids+
#4 -- Very responsive and durable
#5 -- Support for shared apps such as Netflix and Plex

-------------------

#1
One obvious missing features (for me anyway), is an ""extension"" button.
There was an option for that on the leap pad epic when it locked, where you could extend the time for a set window, be it 15 or 30 minutes. Seriously how often does your child ask, ""Just 15 more minutes"". This would be a seriously useful feature and I can't believe it isn't here.

To extend the time, you actually need to change the time when the device will lock on a general basis, which is covered by only two tabs, weekdays and weekends. Also, Friday night is not counted as part of the weekend, so even if you set the device to lock a little later on weekends, be advised that you'll be in for a fight on Sunday night.

Thing is, once I change the time to say 6:15pm, to allow for that extra ""15 minutes"", I then have to remember to change it back before the following night as otherwise it will only lock at 6:15pm and adding on an extra begged-for 15 minutes would then be 6:30pm. The child obviously won't understand this mistake and you end up in a loop of doom. Just unnecessary admin really.

You can however adjust this remotely within your Amazon account itself and I have pulled this off before when I've remembered with just minutes to spare. Still, no one wants to be James Bond all the time and overall, just not a good user experience. The pause and resume buttons within the parent dashboard, as useful as they seem, do not override the bedtime controls. So thinking that I could just ask the tablet to resume and then manually pause it again 15 minutes later is also a no-go.

#2
Have you previously done in-app purchases and effectively purchased the full version of a game that you would like to share with your child? In-App full version purchases such as those required by Bimi Boo and Pink Fong...

Well sadness is that they simply don't work, your child has to play on the account with which the in-app purchases took place and this defeats the purpose as this is the adult account. Even though you share the apps with the child account, only the free version is shared and not the full version. It is at this point where you begin getting keyboard imprints on your face.

I sat on an amazon help desk chat for well over an hour, was transferred 5 times and they promised to help me and then the last agent being at the actual app store, my final stop, disconnected without initiating the chat. Further keyboard imprints take place.

During that support process I was told I would need to change my child out of the 3-5 age range in order for them to work, not something I wanted to do as it bypassed parental controls for that age group and at the end of the exercise, it was not something that worked anyway. I was then advised to remove and re-add the account, that too did not work. I eventually contacted the creators of Bimi Boo and they told me that the Amazon App store doesn't support the sharing of in-app purchases, I would need to take up the matter with Amazon themselves.

I simply haven't had the energy to revisit this. I do think the only way to do so however, is to be refunded and then do the in-app purchases a second time through the actual device itself. The device is assigned it's own kindle address, but is not otherwise associated with an email address of its own. So I'm not even entirely sure how in-app purchases would work here either.

Anyway, that is $60.00 or so of previously purchased apps which I cannot use unless I repurchase -- gah. I would love to otherwise transfer ownership to that device somehow -- Not like I bought those apps for me anyway.

Rant aside. This is an amazing little device, it is wonderfully responsive and the Kids+ selection is beyond amazing. Everything there is full version and the only 'coins' needed are those you earn in-game. My three year old loves the ""My Hungry Caterpillar"" game where you feed him, play with him and put him to bed for a period of days until he then turns into a beautiful butterfly; after which the whole process begins again. Another firm favourite is ""Little Fox Animal Doctor"" where you cure a number of very cute little characters who are ailing from various illnesses and accidents.

The tablet includes a year free of Kids+ and for a monthly cost of $5 a month, it is definitely worth it for the quality of content, lots of Disney apps too.

My favourite thing about this tablet is that the interface changes based on the age group.
The current group my daughter is in, 3-5 has only images, the next group up 6-12 a has large images and text, finally the teen group pretty much looks as it does in the adult mode. This would actually make a mighty fine Android tablet all on it's own.

In conclusion, other than the cons mentioned above, this is a very worthwhile purchase.",negative
201,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 Kids tablet, 8"" HD display, ages 3-7, 32 GB, Pink Kid-Proof Case",$109.99,5,"Upgraded from Fire 7 Kids tablet, 16 GB, (2019 release). Major improvements!

First, the battery life is fantastic. The Fire 7 would drain its battery in a single day if not left on a charger. I tried messing with every setting without success. The kids use the new Fire 8 for a while, leave it off, then use again, and it's still at like 90% charge the next day.

2nd, there is finally a setting for volume control limits!!!! This was the biggest cause of arguments. 2 kids who want their tablet the loudest. Now you can limit the volume.

USB-C charging, so I think I can finally get rid of my micro-USB cables and use the same USBC i have for everything else already.

32GB will definitely come in handy. I was constantly being warned on the old tablets about full memory, but most of the junk you cannot clear out. The only way to fix them was factory reset, and then they would fill up again. Between kids taking videos and instantly downloading any app they click on, memory gets chewed up fast.

Finally, transferring all data from the previous fire to the new one was so easy. No cables required.

One wish - that Amazon would not let them download any app immediately without anything but a single touch. They don't understand the concept of ROM. Sometimes they push things by accident and I have to uninstall it.",positive

I used to get so tired of constantly having to recharge that thing, to the point where it was almost always dead and my child couldn't use it. It also lagged a whole lot.
This one, on the other hand, stays charged for several days, doesn't lag (opening up youtube videos on the other one would end up in this annoying loop of trying to play the video and stopping, but this one is pretty much instant) I think it's double the RAM so that makes sense. My non-verbal toddler has become very good at using this device and can navigate what he wants to do on his own, and it's nice to see him excel at something when he is delayed in everything else. We don't yet know for sure if he is on the spectrum but for parents stuck in that waiting period of testing this has been really good when it comes to choosing what he wants to do and other skills. It's helped a lot.",positive

We keep an anti-glare screen protector on it to make it easier on the eyes. The profile settings through the parent dashboard are amazing. We have 4 of these now and they all keep the same profile setting I’ve only needed to set once. They also share individual profile personalization my kiddos set themselves. I like being able to monitor what they use the most and how child friendly the apps are. From virtual pets to learning videos they have an extensive selection available to them. They can also have books for reading and it’s awesome I can share some of my books with them as well. Over all I love it, very family friendly and useful in a variety of ways. The bumper on this is amazing too. I was skeptical of tablets for kids but I’m glad we gave this a try. It’s very fun for my kids and they are very excited to share some of the random facts they learn from the wide selection of apps on this device. My littles are 7-9 and the smallest with very limited screen time is a preschooler. He has learned numbers, animals, caring for others, shapes, letters, colors, and puzzles.

I have no idea how this tablet still works just as good as the day I bought it, or even turns on for that matter, but it’s still going and I just have to say it has served it’s purpose many times over! I never wrote reviews good, or bad, but I felt the need to really brag on this product for its durability and all the entertainment and fun my child has gotten from it. He loves it, even though he is rough with it. It’s probably one of the best made products I have ever bought.

205,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 Kids tablet, 8"" HD display, ages 3-7, 32 GB, Pink Kid-Proof Case",$109.99,4,"I like the tablet, it has lots of good content for my son. I just don’t understand some if the parent controls like the ability to download. I don’t understand why some apps it’ll let the tablet download others I have to ok it. Now he likes to story’s and watches some pbs shows. For the prime day price I’ll say it’s worth it, but normal full price I’m not sure. Below is a more in depth review
Pros:
I like the kid friendly settings. There is one setting that allows you setup the tablet interface for a younger child( one that can’t read) or one for a child that can. Also like the selection of apps and books. I think specs for the price is good, and the case bundled with the tablet is great. The interactive Dr. Seuss books are a hit with my son, and great for him to start exploring books on his own.
Cons:
The app permission setting is a slight miss for me, I put it to where the child can download something’s but idk what constitutes as something he can or cannot download. I also don’t like that there is a subscription, it’s cheap for prime members 4.99 a month and I think 7 for non prime members. But I think it should be included in the prime membership already. Finally the last con, the possibility of some apps or books not being available if I don’t continue the subscription.",positive

(Despite some scary accidents, NONE of these tablets have been damaged at all!)

The possibilities are endless when you are on WiFi, and when we will be off the grid, I load games and videos that can be played/viewed offline. Even the two-year-olds are navigating through games and their favorite movies without assistance.

Why better than an iPad? Well, on an iPad, young kids frequently hit the button on the front or the screen, bumping themselves out of their activities and need assistance getting back in... While the design of the Fire Tablets (buttons all on the side) coupled with the design of the kids' case (thick edge to hold, without touching the screen by accident) eliminates accidentally getting bumped out of an activity by just holding the unit the wrong way!",positive
207,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 8 Kids tablet, 8"" HD display, ages 3-7, 32 GB, Pink Kid-Proof Case",$109.99,4,"We purchased this tablet for our 3 year old to replace a not so child friendly galaxy tablet we’d been letting her use. She was very excited to see it after I set it up and let it charge. However, we quickly noticed that some of the Amazon Prime Video content she loved and watched on our other tablet was for some reason not available on this Fire kids tablet. I’m talking kids shows such as Blue’s Clues and Bubble Guppies. Instead, you have to add individual videos of those shows (if they are available) from YouTube by going through the settings. I had to watch a YouTube video tutorial to figure out how to do it. The other con is the battery life. It’s supposed to get 12 hours with reasonable use, but I find it gets closer to 6-8. Not a big deal as we always have a charger with us, but something to consider if your child will be primarily using this to watch movies on long trips.
Otherwise, this tablet is excellent. It is very kid friendly and comes with so much content that you would otherwise have to pay for on a different device. We were able to download HBOMAX and Disney+ without any issues. I love knowing my daughter can’t accidentally access the internet and find herself places she shouldn’t be. There is so much downloadable content that it is still usable even when WiFi isn’t available. Overall, we are very happy with our purchase.",positive

A surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn't get the attention it deserves.

LEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE
Having recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021. I didn't need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.

The 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks. A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those ""laptop-y"" things... and an 11"" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.

PRIME DAY HUNTING
With those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook. I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago. A few other ""deals"" weren't any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).

I ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).

I watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review. In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.

UNBOXING AND USE
When the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook. I don't have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook). No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.

The lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.

The screen is a matte screen... yes! I've always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn't a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.

The keyboard isn't the same as that found on Lenovo's other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.

The trackpad works well and is consistent.

Battery life is extremely good. I haven't run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I've run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours. I don't know how true that is, but I'll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.

Performance is more than adequate. The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.

TAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT
Because expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit. It's nothing personal against them, it's how we're all wired. That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.

Lenovo has been ""killing it"" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space. Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.

I've owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were. I'm baffled as to why expert reviewers haven't given this device more attention.

I was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.

I'm delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks. I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.",positive

I had a trusty Samsung Chromebook but it just reached its support expiration date. I was amazed to pay less for this Lenovo IdeaPad 3 11 than I did for that old Samsung, especially since it's also clearly better: more light-weight, more portable (but same screen size), and very noticeably faster, with a superior keyboard and touchpad. I was thinking of getting another Samsung, but the one in a comparable price range did not have a micro SanDisk slot, which my old Samsung did have and which I find very useful, since I download a lot of files in the course of a month. That was the decisive factor for me. The only thing I regret is not looking around for an even *better* price, which I discovered I could have had from BestBuy. But I still think the price is incredible, especially with hyper-inflation. Strongly recommended, so long as you don't mind an 11.6"" screen. But shop around.... :-)",positive

The Lenovo is reasonably fast, cycles through apps adequately, as you would expect from a no frills chromebook. The screen isn't a touch screen, and it has a matte feel to it.

The only real downside is the screen brightness. I often find my kids pushing the brightness key in frustration, knowing full well that they've maxed out the nits' capacity of the screen, and that their efforts are futile.

The speed capability can actually hit over 900mbps but you'd have to have top of the line wireless devices and be right next to the router in order to ever come near that speed. Plus that speed is really never necessary to be honest, just more of a bragging point than anything. The range is where we had issues. The problem were were having is downstairs in certain parts of the house, the Internet speeds were not strong enough to stream, which really only requires a consistent 30mbps in my experience. So I bought three Eero 6+ (3-pack), knowing I could easily return it off it didn't work. Let me tell you, there's no way we're returning those trio of little internet expanding dynamos! We have two of the upstairs (one hardwired to the main connection where the old router was, one in the room I use as my work-from-home office, and one in the kitchen downstairs). The difference, especially downstairs is amazing. I've always been a user of speedtest.net (by Ookla) to test internet speeds. With our old router, depending on where you were located downstairs, you could reach speeds of 50mbps or lower, usually much lower in some places. If you stepped outside into our backyard, it basically didn't work at all. But not anymore! Anywhere in the house we always have 160-220mbps, regardless of location. When I go into the backyard now and test it, usually around 200mbps! I'm telling you, if you have a horse over 2,000sf, this Eero mesh system is a great investment!! You can easily have numerous devices using the Internet at the same time, from anywhere in the house, and even outside! One of the best technology purchases I've ever made.

Seems like something for the paranoid type. Adding WPA3 and local DNS caching is enough for me. I don’t care how many random pings or “attacks” occur every day- I know it’s ongoing and in the vast majority of cases not truly a specific threat to your system. The 3 node system is the key to great WiFi aided by the back channel connection - it really gets a great signal to nearly every device. One gotcha- if your used to a standard 4 port base router and need to connect more than one wired device in addition to the cable modem/internet source at the “main” node, you’re in for a surprise. A cheap switch will solve that problem. Although each of the remotes can handle 2 Ethernet connections, one of which can be used to connect the nodes to one another. A great choice to minimize interference. Overall I couldn’t be happier. I never needed tech support so I could give them 5 stars in all fairness.",positive

During set up, for whatever ever reason, my Samsung S9 and the Eero would not communicate. After several hours I could not get it set up. I followed every instruction to the letter. I decided to get in touch with support, but I work during the day and Saturdays, and support was ""live"" chat only. The ""live"" chat offered no help on resolving my inability to connect the system. After much frustration, my house mate said we should try his iPhone 8. We download the app to his phone, and within minutes, we had the system set up. Perhaps my phone had a setting incorrect, but I find it ridiculous that none of the troubleshooting methods mentioned something could be wrong with the settings on my phone.

The good part:
Once set up was completed, the system has run flawlessly (so far). My internet speed has increased by almost 3. (100 Mbps to nearly 300 Mbps) I am able move throughout the home and have no connection interruptions. The Eero modules are very small and discreet. Assuming you don't hard wire them, there is only one power cable going to them, and one Ethernet line on the main node.

I have a pretty robust home automation system, so I wanted something that would function the same but without the stability issues.

First off, this network is really easy to install, it didn’t take long at all. The app makes it easy to add devices, and get the home automation pieces up and running. So far the system is very stable, and shows none of the drops Samsung had.

Additionally, I found the response from the home automation devices to be much quicker on this than on SmartThings. Likely due to connecting directly with the Echo and Alexa app, without going through a middleman app like SmartThings.

The one thing this network needs to improve upon is device steering. It’s pretty bad compared to a system like Plume that Samsung used. With that software I could see the handoff from node to node, and it was quick, as I walked through the house.

With Eero, I can have a my laptop a couple of feet from a node on the same room and the software will link it to a node on another floor. It definitely impacts the network speed, so I really hope Amazon upgrades the software.

I was having to reboot the Surfboard a few times a week when my download speeds would drop to 20 or 30 (I should get over 300). Learned that was an issue with the Surfboard. Motorola is made by the same company but doesn't have Puma chip issues (latency and jitters) that the Arris does.
SO, setup (and I am NOT a techie....I'm a senior who learns by her mistakes) was easy enough. The ethernet cable that comes with the modem is VERY short. That is OK if your router is very close to your modem. In my case, my router is up HIGH on a shelf across the room from the modem, and I need a big step stool to reach it. I have a very very long ethernet chord and needed to make sure it would work (I don't interchange things like that without asking). FORGET reaching anyone in Motorola customer service by phone. email they say they will answer within two days....I finally got through on chat support. The guy answered right away. YEP, it will work. Same category 5. I turned the modem on and everything connected except bottom LAN light kept blinking green. I hadn't closed my CHAT with motorola so I asked that question....the man answered that was normal. Checked my speed. Where I had normally gotten around 325-350MBPS, it was 25. NOT GOOD. Motorola guy was still around and he said it was an Xfinity problem - they must not have configured it right when they activated. EEEEEE. I called and you don't want to go through that robot voice hell if you don't have to with Xfinity. the robot restarted the modem. Said call back in 10 minutes. I did. Robot insisted on restarting the modem again. We went through this 3 times before I got my call put through to an agent....but another robot said my wait time was over 2 hours. I put the phone to the side and managed to be 53 in line on a chat with Xfinity. I will not go into detail but THAT was a waste...the Chat guy never understood the problem....phone lady finally answered after only 45 minutes. NO issues with the MODEM she says...let's reboot your router. STUPID ME STUPID ME. I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT. Reboot router so he recognizes the new kid on the block. I KNEW that...my brain was in a fog I guess. Would have saved me about 2 hours of aggravation. Rebooted. My speed was then 365 Mbps. It has held steady at more than what I pay for (Xfinity is good about that).
SO, BUY this modem. Make sure your router is new enough to support it (I have a Netgear Nighthawk AC1900 that is apparently the minimum you can use but it is an amazing router). Make sure you have a compatible ethernet cable (being Category 5 seems to be the key and it is written on all cables) if you need it longer than about 6 ft. (or maybe 5 ft - it is short). I'm hoping this modem will last 5 years or so. I am a happy old lady. My hubs is happy because he can stream the golf channel without buffering. My Alexas work in every room, my light bulbs and doorbell are nicely connected and all is right with the world (or at least in my home)",positive

We bought this modem to replace the rental. (We already had a WiFi router to connect to this new modem.)

We attached the coax to the modem, attached the modem to the ethernet port on a laptop, powered up the modem, and followed the instructions which said to go to motorola.com. That took us Mediacom log in page and then to Mediacom's hardware setup page. We followed the instructions but eventually the setup failed and it prompted us to call Mediacom. I called. They verified our account and asked for the MAC address for the new modem. They need pinged it, saw it, sent a setup command to it, et voila, I could access the internet from the computer connected directly to the modem via ethernet. I then disconnected the ethernet cable from the laptop and plugged it into the WiFi router, then powered up the router, and then we had internet via WiFi throughout the house.

It is suggested that you do a speed test WHILE CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO THE MODEM VIA ETHERNET to confirm that you are getting the speed that you pay for. I had to call Mediacom back to confirm our plan and they then confirmed that the modem was setup for a lower tier plan. They sent new commands immediately and then we had the speed we subscribed to. Point being, this modem is capable of speeds higher than the internet provider can deliver so if it is slow, it is likely not the modem - it's either the setup done by the internet provider, or the wiring/signal.",positive

Motorola Ultra Fast DOCSIS 3.1 Cable Modem, Model MB8600, plus 32x8 DOCSIS 3.0, Certified by Comcast XFINITY

Paper instructions were in the box and also online. No firmware available for prior update. I had previously confirmed that this device is acceptable to Comcast. Before buying any network device, always check that your ISP supports the device you plan to buy. Unacceptable for us to rate an item poorly if its is not compatible with your stuff...

I replaced a Cisco - Linksys model DPC3008 DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem purchased thru Amazon for $90 exactly five years ago. It has never failed. I would have paid Comcast say $10 / month to lease their inferior modem for the last 60 months, using the roughly $510 savings to enjoy Comcast ""Blast"" speeds not supported by their leased modem. I viewed this purchase as another future-proof, leading edge decision to replace a 5-year old $90 device. I did not expect a speed increase. Here is why.

If I log into my Comcast account and search for upgrades for my Internet service, there is only a fiber option. I am maxed out at a supported wire speed of ""150 mbps"". I attained that with the 5-year old DOCSIS 3.0 device. So, Comcast does not yet offer DOCSIS 3.1 service here; and, they will not reveal that to customers. I searched for a couple of hours for that revelation. The new MB8600 has a connect LED the turns blue with a 3.1 connection else stays green to confirm 3.0 per the instructions. Mine is green now. So, ""NO"", Comcast has not brought DOCSIS 3.1 to my area.

Follow the instructions. They work. I suggest however that you perform a broadband speed test prior to switching out your old cable modem. I also suggest you have your Comcast account number from a bill and ensure your Comcast account has your current phone number. NOT clearly said; but, I also suggest that you eliminate your network's switches / routers / Wi-Fi and simply Ethernet connect to any one of the four gigabit Ethernet ports on the back of the MB8600. I used port one.

The MB8600 synced up with Comcast quickly (according to the lights); but, I could not obtain an Internet connection. I'm guessing Windows 10 Pro simply was trying to protect me from a new intrusion. This is not a Windows 10 / Microsoft Edge issue. Solution: delete all network settings, reboot and there it was, Comcast activate. Enter your data and your MB8600 will reset. Once completed, I was online within 15 minutes. But, the speeds I had before were faster than now. Guess that my firmware had not yet been updated by Comcast.

The label on the bottom of the MB8600 has an IP address, user name and password. I logged in and saw that the modem had provisioned to DOCSIS 3.0 with only one channel down and three channels up, far below its capacity in 3.0. You resolve this by pressing in the RESET button on the back of the MB8600 for several seconds till the lights flash. After, I now have 24 channels down and three channels up. I then retested my speeds to confirm that I was exceeding the Comcast Extreme 150 service level I am paying for: 180 mbps down / 24 up. That is a roughly 10% improvement still on DOCSIS 3.0. Again, Comcast here does not seem to support any faster wired speed than 150 mbps, and deeper level of DOCSIS 3.0 than 24X3 and no DOCSIS 3.1, now, no DOCSIS 3.0 32x4 either. I can hope but AOL is perceived as ""high tech"" here...

I hate contacting Comcast customer service since I always feel as if I am training them. I may invest the day it will likely take to get Comcast to remotely re-provision my interface with them. Maybe not.

Satisfied that I was connected as well as I could, I then moved on to reconnect my router for its Wi-Fi and more importantly for its added Trend Micro security not offered by the MB8600 since it is not a router, its a cable modem. My configuration is MB8600 to an Asus router with 4 gigabit ports and Wi-Fi AC2400. One wired port feeds a dumb Gigabit switch supporting five devices. A second wired port supports my Microsoft Book. I'm a retired IT guy so I avoid wireless connections excepting my cell.

Yes, I have my cable modem, router and PC powered thru an uninterruptable power supply. The MB8600 documentation states that its power supply is resistant to power surges. We have afternoon storms all summer. Its fun to continue surfing while neighbors are dark; yet, my Comcast and DirecTV both work fine with a UPS power supply. Good that Motorola upgraded to some surge protection; but, I want that and sine wave continuous power. For your consideration....

The MB8600 has been connected for roughly six hours. It is barely warm and only at its top. Off to a good start.

UPDATE JUL2018: The MB8600 is still running like a champ. No issues. Comcast finally has some competition from Century Link with its fiber optic Gigabit offering wired into my neighborhood just days before hurricane Irma. I signed up for it since its cost was just a minor bump for gigabit from 150 mbps. A few months ago, the green DOCSIS icon turned from green to blue indicating that Comcast had turned on version 3.1 but; I was provisioned for 150 Mbps and did not see a speed jump. Nine months later, still no Century Link offer.

Regardless, I opted to move to a different home. Unfortunately an older neighborhood with no Century Link fiber optic. But Comcast does offer Gigabit speed at a higher price. Comcast's cables here are 30 to 40 years old unfortunately.

I've been with Comcast for well more than 8 years. This was the first move / install that was completed correctly the first time. The tech clocked 960 Mbps at the MB8600 down. My PC sees less speed (580 to 870 down) with a reliable 40 Mbps up. The MB8600 performs as advertised. All 32 downstream channels and 4 upstream channels are locked.",positive

Wow. I really like this modem. This is a barebones rock solid dead simple workhorse.

It's got a plug for the cable and one ethernet (RJ-45) port out and I think an on/off switch.
That's it. It makes a connection. And hasn't failed since I got it a month or so ago.

All I had to do was call my ISP and give them the MAC address (on the sticker on the device)
and they updated their tables and that was it. Turn it on. It goes through the startup cycle. Takes a few minutes to connect like they all do and that's it. Set it and forget it.

What prompted me to get it, is I don't like having to rent the modem from the ISP @ $10.00/mo forever. This literally pays for itself in 16 months, and most people will have their Internet connection for many times that long, and time flies. So it's a good investment.

It doesn't have phone connection like the ISP's modem did. So I called the company/provider that owns copper phone lines in the area and ordered landline service. I'm a nerd/techie and don't care what people say about landlines being for old fogeys, it's like having a backup generator ... I know I can use that landline if the power goes out or if the cell tower gets overwhelmed (too many calls or cell traffic at once), or there's radio interference in the area. Technically cable phone is a 'land line' (hardwired cable connection to provider) and the battery backup in the modem (which the ISP charges more for), could give you emergency phone service in an outage, but a cable phone connection can (and does) fail for more reasons than copper wire phone service does. (Those copper wire connections are called POTS - which stands for Plain Old Telephone Service), and copper wire phones are the most reliable.

Having a separate modem from a router is optima for a few of reasons... Generally hybrid units of anything do everything okay, but nothing optimally (for example combination modem-router units like my ISP rents out). Better to keep the modem separate from the router. Then you can swap either out independently to upgrade as needed, disrupting less of your own network configuration doing so, and also help avoid a single point of failure. Plus, you might be able to score a router in a pinch on shorter notice than a cable modem if the router is the component that fails. Then you can choose the router you actually like, for whatever reason, and don't have to settle for whatever bundling du jour your ISP decides is right for you (even if it isn't).

That gets me to the other point. What DID the ISP decide was right for me (but wasn't)?

For awhile my ISP modem connection was dropping briefly in the middle of the morning. My computer came back up connected to the ISP's 'general public' wi-fi connection to their router which did not work for me and I'd have to keep manually switching back to my own internal Wi-Fi LAN (network). That was not only inconvenient but it forced me to investigate was was going on there.

I learned my ISP gives lets passersby connect to their rental-modem's Wi-Fi signal, without giving me any way to disable that service! That really pissed me off to learn. The idea is that people driving around who have accounts with the provider can get internet access around the neighborhoods. If I was a passerby, that could really help me, so at first glance maybe 'why not, be a good samaritan'.

But wait! There may be more too it than that.

Besides the fact that I don't like it (for good reason), they give me no control over that 'feature'!
And I see some downsides. What's good for the ISP isn't necessarily optimal for me.

What I don't like about that 'service' is that one or more people could sit outside and suck down bandwidth (e.g. slow my connection down), unbeknownst to me. It also might cause the unit to use more energy and put out a stronger wi-fi signal than it needs to. Which health conscious people are well advised to be aware of. Wi-Fi is radiation. Not strong and may not ruin your life, but it is a stressor at a cellular level, this is known. And strong signals, persistent signals and people who are more sensitive or have immunity issues can be more vulnerable (headaches, sleep disruption, or worse). But I like Wi-Fi so I settle for whatever unknown health consequences I may not be aware of.

Also it makes me wonder if a hacker might be able to use it as an additional point of access to my home network.

I also wonder if it's 100% clear to law enforcement at first glance who might be visiting sites or doing something nefarious from the connection point. Might it look like the owner is doing something that a passerby did (and even if they can sort it out later, what if it takes awhile to figure out and they make a bad assumption?)

Anyway, I don't have that problem with this modem and I'm just much happier with it all the way around.

Plus it's blazingly fast.",positive

Overall I really like it but there was a learning curve with the software. Here are my thoughts and experiences with it.

Pro's:
- Price is excellent if you can catch a sale.
- Case is very good. Great protection, good quality. I really like that they put thought into maximizing the sound with the case. The speakers are on the edge of the device and they make a cool curved area so that the sound from the speakers is redirected towards the user. Works very well.
- Battery life is really good.
- Curated list of age-appropriate content is very good.
- You can remove content as desired.
- Great warranty.
- As your child grows, the list of content and interface can grow with them. The main interface is optimized for either readers or non-readers and can be changed if your non-reader learns to read. The curated content is age-based, so as they age, the content remains appropriate for their age.
- You have control over age range of curated content. You can set it to whatever you want depending on where your particular child is developmentally. You can also set the range in terms on age range, too. Say your kid is 8, you can make just 8 year old content available, or ages 2-8, or 7-10. Whatever you want.

Con's
- Software could be a lot easier to manage for parents. Some of the content we wanted to remove. It's possible but it took me a few internet searches and some fumbling around in the software to find. I work in technology/software and am pretty savvy and it still wasn't easy.
- No button to show running apps, so you can't directly switch between apps without going to the home screen first.
- Hardware is pretty meh. It's all pretty basic, lower resolution screen, processor is on the lower end, body material is plastic and feels cheapish. RAM is ok at 3GB.
- Storage - only offering 32GB is inexcusable. It allows for very little content to be downloaded/cached on the device and will become a problem at some point for almost everyone. It should be 64GB as the base and they should offer 128GB as an upgrade. You're basically required to use an SD card since the 32GB is so small, most people would be fine if it cost a few bucks more and storage wasn't the problem it is now.

Other thoughts:
The software overall is really good in my opinion. It for sure needs to be more intuitive in regard to management for parents. However, my daughter has had no issues at all with using it herself. The interface is perfect for her age. It also includes some premium content as well through Kindle books and Nickelodeon shows/games. It's shows and characters she's already interested in, so all that content is fantastic.

Another surprise hit was the experiences available with many of the books, that there are options for the book to be read out loud to your child, or for them to read it, or for a parent to read it for them. A very thoughtful and useful feature. My daughter loves having the books narrated for her and is helping in her progress toward learning to read.

Some reviews have mentioned issues with certain apps, including ABC Mouse. We use that one a lot and have had no issues whatsoever. I assume that issues other reviewers had in the past have been resolved by software updates.

When you first dive into this ecosystem, it can be a bit overwhelming. There's a lot of features and settings, as well as content. After learning how to use and manage it, I can say that I really like it and there's nothing currently on the market that's as good of an end to end experience. I highly recommend giving it a try and stick with it as you work to understand everything. Once you've got it figured out, it's pretty easy to manage and great for kids.",positive

It SHOULD read ExFAT, but it will only read MS-DOS(FAT)/FAT32. I don't think this is a global problem since most people seem to have no problem mounting the ""sold separately but made for Amazon Fire"" SanDisk microSD cards. I bought a 128GB card to go with this tablet and it didn't mount in the system at all. I tried reformatting it on my computer thinking it was the card, and it still wouldn't work. Finally I tried formatting it to MS-DOS(FAT) and that worked (though now I'm limited to 4GB on file sizes). I saw other people on the SanDisk microSD page leaving questions and reviews about how the cards weren't working and I'm pretty sure it's not the card, it's this tablet. My computer was reading the card just fine, and I tried various other microSD cards that I've used in other tablets, cameras, and Fires and those also only worked if they were MS-DOS(FAT) formatted.

Has a reliable reputation, bright AF screen, sturdy chassis, 16gb ram is good enough for most users so it's pretty damn fast, and just an overall well rounded computer.

1.) The keyboard is so mushy! It's so annoying to use. I own a 2018 MacBook Pro and I prefer the keyboard on that 1000 times over. It's more response and tactile. I absolutely hate the keyboard on the macbook 14. I went out of my way to purchase a logitech craft keyboard and that's amazing let me tell you.

2.) The window splitting on macos is so stupid! I cannot have multiple windows open on the first attempt. I wish it was more like windows were you just drag them to the side and you split it! Boom that is so simple.

3.) Macos does not support a lot of games, but that's a pretty decent trade off I guess.

4.) The price and the fact that for that price it's not customizable.

I mean there aren't a lot of bad things about it but for the life of me I am unable to stand this pc when I need to have multiple excel spreadsheets and Adobe or Word documents open! I usually end up closing this pc in frustration and just use my blade 14! Now that's a PC! Just wish the screen was oled or at least 4k, but it's fine.

The only LAG I've encountered is from the GOOGLE tabs on my browser. Gmail hogs TONS of RAM, and certain Google Sheets and Google Docs sometimes take over 4GB of RAM, for some reason. I have 16GB, but I maxed it out once and had to quit some, and it was fine. Not the Mac's fault. It's not you, it's me, Mac.
The NOTCH is totally fine. Don't even notice it as it fits right into the file menu across the top of the screen.

PRODUCT SELECTION — My preference is to purchase products of brands I'm familiar with. Sometimes with specialty items, familiar brands are not available. So, I look at the product branding to see if the product is generic or has branding on it. You'll notice some Amazon products being sold by different sellers have no distinguishable manufacturer details other than ""Made in China"" and often it's the same product sold by different vendors.

310,Computers & Accessories,"ARRIS SURFboard SB8200 DOCSIS 3.1 Gigabit Cable Modem | Approved for Cox, Xfinity, Spectrum & others | White , Max Internet Speed Plan 1000 Mbps",$153.05,4,"I purchased the Arris SB8200 for Xfinity Gigabit Internet service as they have a deal for two years for the same price as the 400Mbps plan ($69.99). So in order to save almost $15 a month I decided to buy my own modem to replace my aging Motorola (Arris) SB6141. My SB6141 netted me 259Mbps down and 35Mbps up on my previous plan of 400Mbps down and 35Mbps up, which is great for a 8x4 channel Docsis 3.0 cable modem. So since Arris bought Motorola modem cable division I decided to get another one having had a great product with the 6141. The Arris SB8200 is also the only Docsis 3.1 modem with two Ethernet ports capable of doing 2Gbps down and is the most future proof of any modem on the market at the time of writing this review. And you can get a refurbished model for half the price which is even better!

Inside the Arris SB8200 is a Broadcom BCM3390 chipset (a much needed change from the SB6190’s Intel Puma 6 chipset which had hardware bugs and caused them a lawsuit for good measure), 3GB of RAM, 128MB S34ML01G200TFV00 Spansion flash memory NAND and 16MB Macronix MX25L12805D SPI NAND flash memory. The SB8200 is capable of downstream bonded channels up to 32 SCQAM or 2 OFDM and upstream bonded channels up to 8 SCQAM or 2 OFDMA (32x8 SCQAM and 2x2 OFDM). The Ethernet ports are only Gigabit Ethernet and therefore the Max you will get is 950Mbps average down and it will never be possible to the the boxes 10Gbps selling spiel. Even if you don't have Docsis 3.1 in your area or a Gigabit internet speed plan this modem will serve you for many years to come. And this modem has 3GB of RAM, which the other Docsis 3.1 modems have 256MB or less! RAM! Oh and with most providers (Xfinity included) you can call them and add a separate IP address for the second Ethernet port for a small fee (Xfinity charges like $5.95 if I'm remembering correctly). This would be great if you wanted to connect a gaming console directly to the modem for the best speeds and then connect your home router to the second. And eventually you'll be able to kick in 2Gbps by merging those two Ethernet ports!

Setup of the device was quick and easy and you simply plugin the coxial cable, Ethernet cable to your device (router for 99% of the people) and power cable and you are off and running. A quick call to your internet provider (Xfinity for me) to add the HFC MAC address and the modem is registered and provisioned and I'm up and running within ten minutes. Xfinity will try to send out a tech but you can get them to override it if you know what you are doing. Gigabit internet can be extremely temperamental as we'll discuss later which is the reason Xfinity requires sending out a tech on all Gigabit plan installs. And again this is simply a modem so you will need a router if you want wifi or the ability to connect more than one device.

The performance of the Arris SB8200 is top notch and I was easily able to pull my provisioned modem speeds from my Xfinity service. I was able to test 1.4Gbps down (Fast.com also includes backend speed as actual can only be 950Mbps as I mentioned above) and 45Mbps up. On Speedtest.net my tests are almost always 930-960Mbps (or near that) down and 40-50Mbps up. These speeds are AMAZING and just my upload speed is faster than most people's download speeds! Right now Xfinity is only utilizing Docsis 3.1 for the downstream channels so the modem lights will have a blue light for downstream and a green light for upstream (this is not an error or bug).

My issues arose with my Xfinity service and resets, slow speeds (300Mbps Max down), etc. Xfinity sent out a tech and that did nothing. So another rech came and found a ton of ingress coming from 4 lines on my tap. He trapped them off and I was up and running with Gigabit speeds again. Then the resets started, at night almost every 10 minutes! It was only happening between 10pm and 7am average, EVERY NIGHT! I had more techs out, supervisors and more supervisors! After a month (and many hours of my time and speaking up) the issue was resolved as it was a bad line amplifier which was causing noise and caring my upstream to spike into the high 50s, which triggers resets on the modem and t3/t4 errors. Now my neighbors were having issues on certain channels and slow internet but their modems WERE NOT RESETTING! And we knew my modem wasn't bad as it was fine for over 12 hours a day with no errors at all in the log until night began to fall everyday. And In fact my neighbors never lost internet, EVER but my internet was almost useless at night time. So the Arris SB8200 is extremely sensitive to t3/t4 errors and the threshold for errors and resets is much higher for the Xfinity owned gateways and modems. Also Arris had out out a firmware update previously about severe sensitivity to t3/t4 errors and I had the latest version but I was still having issues so they still need to work on this. If you are experiencing issues with your Arris modem navigate to http://192.168.100.1 and you'll be able to see basic signal information, modem error logs, modem and firmware info. You can use this information and post it in the support forums to get help and diagnose any problems.

But now that the line and backend errors are corrected it's smooth sailing and I'm saving myself a ton of money (the new Xfinity modem charge is $14 plus tax and it will be $15 by the beginning of 2020 so you pay for the modem in a little over a year) every year and you'll have the newest technology that is even better than the Xfinity modems and gateways, many of which use the Puma 6 chipset which I mentioned above (causing severe lag and timeouts which can kill online gaming or video watching). So I'm paying $69.99 and getting Gigabit speeds of 950Mbps down and 48Mbps up which is a great deal hands down and you won't find speeds that cheap ANYWHERE ELSE! The Arris brand is keeping the Motorola spirit alive and kicking which is great for competition! The Arris SB8200 is the best modem you can buy for your money right now and if you can find a refurbished unit on Amazon even better (they didn't have any when I bought mine but three weeks later they did and for $100 cheaper)!",positive

My ISP is Xfinity and it took one try and about 15 minutes to get the unit activated. Most of the time was waiting for apps or the modem to connect. To bypass calling customer support for activation (if all goes well) requires apps that connect to the internet, which will be down to you ISP during activation, this method requires a cellular internet connection with a tablet or smart phone. Save some time and download the Arris and Xfinity apps before you start the activation. The unit looks and feels kind of toyish and is ridiculously small and light compared to my former modem. It does however work well, I'm now getting the download speeds I'm paying for, an extra 100 MB/s that the old modem could not support and could upgrade the speed of the connection. On the down side although the unit has 2 Ethernet ports only one will connect to Xfinity since they (now) only support one IP address per connection. For me I finally figured out the second port has no use and it took a bit of searching to find that out. If your ISP supports dual IPs you could connect additional devices or a switch directly to the modem and not have to connect to a router. Otherwise its dead space. All in all if you only need a DOCSIS 3.1 modem the SB8200 is a great value.",positive

Had it on my list to buy a modem, but I'm not real techy, so kept putting it off out of fear of the time it would take to install a new modem that I would supply. After 5-10 replacements of their cheap modems, I finally got motivated when I lost internet, couldn't get a service tech out for a week, and maxed out the data on a borrowed Verizon hotspot (and they wanted $30 for another 4 gigs of use!). So I ran down to Walmart and bought this thing (Amazon had it for $50 less, so I ordered it on Amazon and took the Walmart one back.)

Wow, I should have done this 5 years ago. This modem is faster, more reliable, and super easy to install. All I had to do was call the Mediacom cable customer support, give them the MAC # that's on the box, and life's good!

I've been using it for 2 weeks now with an 10 year old router/wifi I had laying around, and our internet feels like lightening compared to what we were experiencing before.

In hindsight, no tech ability needed. Just hook it up, read the number, and LG. After all my fuss with Mediacom's modem/router/wifi combo, I decided to keep the equipment separate.

You can read my sad tale below if you choose. But a quick summary may suffice. I got the SB8200 and it worked for 58 days. It then stopped working. It was replaced by Arris but the second modem did not work, either. That modem was replaced by Arris and the third modem did not work. The odds of getting three bad modems were pretty near zero so attention turned to Comcast. A tech came out and confirmed that the SNR was way low and the signal levels were out of bounds. He ran a new cable to the Comcast distribution box and installed a new splitter. The third modem connected immediately and worked perfectly. The fact that my old modem (not a docsis 3.1) worked had initially suggested that the problem was the new modem instead of the Comcast line.

Arris support was GREAT through all this. I got right through to a live tech after about 3-5 rings (after their voice menu system answered and directed my call). They replaced the modems quickly (I had to send old modem back via ground - free return shipping - but they sent replacement modem via next day delivery). This is some of the best support of any company I deal with. It is pretty much the opposite of Comcast where getting to a live agent can be very difficult.

This review was originally a 2 star but is now a 5 star - and I would give Arris support 6 stars if I could.

ORIGINAL POST *********************

I have had this modem for 58 days. It was working well connected to Xfinity. Good download speed. Then, today it became intermittent. It ran for a couple of minutes, then lost internet connection, then was back but at slower download speed. Then it was running fine. That pattern continued to repeat. I had hoped it was an Xfinity issue, but I reconnected my previous modem and everything is working just fine.
Before purchase I had read the bad reviews, but there were way more good reviews so I hoped that I would be one of those customers that got a ""good one"". Nope. Besides EVERY modem I looked at had about the same number of bad reviews. Many saying - don't buy this. So what is one to do?

UPDATE **************

I contacted Arris customer support. I got through to a tech IMMEDIATELY. He said they needed to check the modem while it was online. Since I had already installed by backup modem, I had to contact Comcast and switch my MAC address back to the Arris and get in connected. I then called Arris back and again was connected to a tech, immediately. The reason this is a 2 star rather than a 1 star is because of the ease of contacting support. The tech looked at the modem stats and agreed it was bad. After a 5 minute delay while he consulted with a supervisor, he approved my return of the modem. He emailed me a prepaid shipping label and said they would send a new modem to me as soon as they received the old one back.

So what Arris may lack in quality, they do mostly make up for in good customer support. Realistically, any product can fail, so the experience in dealing with a failed product is an important part of the buying process. Arris support gets 4 stars from me - one star off for making me reinstall the modem so they can verify it was bad. Though that was a perfectly reasonable request from them, I had pretty good evidence of my assertion that it was their modem which was the issue.

Update 2 **********

I got the replacement modem. I spent about 90 minutes on the phone with Xfinity and Arris customer support trying to get that modem working with Xfinity. We could not get the modem to work - it seemed like it was working for a few seconds here and there. So I am sending this replacement back and will get yet another replacement (for the replacement).

Not sure why someone is saying it is no longer supported by Xfinity. It has been very reliable and this is my 3rd or 4th one in the last 15 years or so.
Keep in mind that the new modems have been for upgrade purposes. I haven't had one go bad yet.

I saw an older review where it gave a couple of cons for the SB8200. One complaint was that you could only use one of the ethernet ports in the back. Of course that is true and is working the way its suppose to. It's clearly stated to use the 2nd ethernet port you need to have and 2nd IP given by your ISP provider. This so you could get up to 2 Gbps speeds. Naturally you have to pay extra for this. Not a con if misunderstand the features.

Another con was that it didn't have wifi. How is this a con if it's not designed with that feature??? You want that? Than buy the model with wifi.

Obviously no product has 100% reliability with all customers. For me, it has pretty much been that and that means any future upgrades will be with ARRIS.",positive

I bought this as a bundle along with Amazon EEROS MESH 6.
Installation was very very easy with respect to the devices (MODEM + EERO MESH 6). Need to chat with my ISP since this is the first time I am upgrading from DOCSIS 3.0 to 3.1 and to register this new device with them. If you were with the same dilemma like me, you will see a tremendous increase in Internet speed (you will be surprised by looking at my attached screenshots). Yes I did with doubt for a year to make a decision of upgrading my modem to 3.1 whether it will truly improve the internet speed or is it just a business strategy by ISPs in the market. But now I have to admit it is TRUE. 3.1 upgrade is needed if you do WFH or have multiple device streaming.
I have not explored its full capacity of how many devices it can handle, for now only 16 devices connected and it does it's job with justification.
But I did verify the coverage and it has improved 100%.

In layman terms - ARRIS SB8200 is a modem and does not have an inbuilt router in it. The EERO MESH 6 does the job of a router (physically 3 router devices at your house with the same WIFI name to connect to your devices).
So, No need to manually switch to connect to these MESH devices as we normally do with a WIFI extender. Wherever I move around my house there is a MESH device to back my N/W coverage. I believe it can easily cover 5000 SQFT as they promised. Whenever there is a switch of MESH device happens I can see the coverage strength drop for a second and then regain its full strength in seconds.

I am satisfied so far with this device as far as the coverage, signal strength all over the house and its perimeter (basement, garage, driveway, backyard) and most importantly for the competitive price in the market when compared to the price range of a Netgear ORBI.",positive

I turned everything off, reconnected all the cables as they were before waited a min. or 2 and turned the modem then router back on and I could connect again to my web pages. I wanted to try on last thing. I got my CELL PHONE and went back to the original Arris page and downloaded the user manual through the Google Play Store (becareful it's not the Arris app it's the ""Arris Central ..."" app. Going through THAT version of the manual I saw several links NOT in the other guide/user manual!!!! THIS manual told you to plug the computer ethernet cable DIRECTLY into ""port one"" of the modem to load the page AND what to do when when you get the error code about the page not being secure (different for each web browser). THIS WORKED I was able to change my modem password.!!!!!!! This whole thing took me many hours and it didn't have to be this way.

I own the the original 8 HD, the next generation, and now the latest. Obviously if you love the Amazon environment as I do, you can't go wrong with this tablet. I never ventured into the Apple world simply because I couldn't afford it on a teacher's salary and because I was already invested in Prime.

All of my tablets continue to function without any issues. The 8HD is beginning to show its age because the operation system can't update to the latest and greatest due to hardware issues. But it still will be grabbed for reading and listening to music.

Durable. That is what I would call these tablets. If I was going to use the tablets for other than recreational use, I would be looking for.something else. But as it is, the tablets do what I want them to do at a price point that keeps.me happy.

There are a couple.of issues that have been consistent across the three versions I own. The first is that the battery life has been ,""meh, "". All models promoted themselves as having really decent battery life. That was true when new. All three seemed to begin losing battery life within the first 6-10 months of usage. I am very careful with my charging protocol, making sure I don't just leave them on charge overnight like some people do.

Nowever, with three tablets, I always have one fully charged and ready to go.

The second issue I have with the Amazon tablets is the placement of the volume and power buttons. You would think Amazon could afford some decent investigation into now people.actually handle the tablet when using it. This latest version has been the absolute most annoying. When holding it in my hands, I frequently find I've accidentally changed the volume or turned the tablet off. The 8HD's buttons were recessed enough I never had this problem. But the later versions of the tablet all have the buttons sticking out farther from the case making them easier to locate but also.easier to accidently hit. And, whoever thought the on/off button should be directly under the volume button should never be allowed in a product design studio again.

A minor complaint is the spellchecker. Absolutely the worst I've ever seen. If you don't mind random periods and single words changed into two that don't make sense, like 'because' being change into 'be wise' (Huh?), then this probably won't bother you. Also if your high school English teacher drilled poofreading into your mindset, you should find this spellchecker subroutine an extension of heaven!

All in all, I would give these Amazon tablets a solid 4.5 out of 5 stars for the price point, durability, and ease of use in the Amazon environment. If you're looking for a tablet more for its entertainment value , you can't beat one of these.",positive

Figured it wise to disclose this up front. I’m not adept at all android os devices yet, but learning on the fire tablet has been decently intuitive and relatively easy. For the past 8 years, I’ve used an Apple iPad Air 2013 model that I got refurbished in 2014. It was always a crisp screen view and has held up since I bought the one with the most memory available. This Spring (2022), I noticed that more and more apps were not opening because the outdated OS no longer supported those apps. I kept using the iPad since streaming services were still working. That ended in June 2022–suddenly several of the streaming apps I regularly used stopped opening. I really didn’t want to spend upwards of $1,000 on a new or recently used iPad, so I looked into this recent model Fire tablet. This has been a good alternative so far! The screen resolution while streaming is good. The Home Screen resolution isn’t nearly as crisp as my old iPad was, but I got this Fire tablet on Prime Day for well under $100 (so freaking solid quality nonetheless given how much money I saved). Setting the Fire up was pretty easy, and I’ve been using the kindle feature on it far more than I ever used on my iPhone. I liked how the screen can be personalized, and have generally enjoyed this Fire for the few weeks I had it so far. The only real pain in the @$$ though is despite extending the screen sleep timer to 10+ minutes this thing routinely auto dims or sends its screen into sleep mode frequently while I am actively using it! It’s really annoying, because I can’t just hit a home button to awaken it—I typically have to close the magnetic cover & reopen it. I’m getting used to the exercise, but it’s sure noisome! Maybe this a user error issue?! I’m a bit ignorant on this point and my lack of experience with Fire tablets must be acknowledged. That said, it’s why I knocked off a star. I’ll try to update this review in the future once I’ve better familiarized myself with the OS and researched some online troubleshooting remedy discussions.",positive

Oh, sure. There were hurtful rumors that it jumped, but I still insist it was an accident.

Anyway, the replacement did away with the keyboard, and installed an infuriating pop-up version on which I am forever making typos.This was presumably to increase the screen size. More importantly, they removed the earphone jack. As I spent a fair amount of time listening to the electronic voice reading, while did something else....big issue.

Now we come to my decision to upgrade my smaller Fire tablet to a bigger screen. Being that I put thing off at a Professional level, my wife ended up getting me this as an early birthday present. I encountered yet another 'dump': I can only listen to a book if I own the Audible version. Which means, in essence, about 20 titles, most of which are books I wrote and released through ACX. Since you would literally have to beat me into submission to abandon a ton of better books to listen those...well, you get the general idea. I have probably 900 books that I can't audible skim through while working crosswords or balancing the national debt. So, okay, that latter bit is just an excuse I give my wife, and I suspect she's starting to catch onto the fact.

I know because I went back to it after finishing a book on my new one and the load time of a book that was already downloaded to it was about the same as the wait to download and open a book on the new.

I primarily use tablets for streaming purposes, audio and video. This device does both very well.
My primary apps:
iHeart Radio
Peacock
ESPN
xfinity Stream (companion app for Cable TV)
Amazon Prime
Amazon Prime Music
Spotify

All of those apps work well. Video quality is equal to an iPad (yes I also have one of those).
iHeart Radio has a problem with streaming one particular radio station on this tablet, but I suspect it is not primarily a Fire problem.

I typically use bluetooth headphones, but the built-in speakers work well when I need them.

Battery life is multiple days for me. I typically run the battery down to 10% then charge up to 90%. (it helps having another tablet available)

Of note -- fast charging via USB-C works fine with this tablet.

Of note 2 -- no YouTube app, but! You can download an 'app' (on-screen button) that just opens youtube.com, which works just fine.

Occasional minor problems with touching the right spot on the screen for some menu options -- but I suspect my fat fingers are the problem more than the device.",positive

I don't access any email or social media accounts, not even a calendar. As I said, I really only wanted a unit that could hold a lot of downloaded reading materials.

When this new model 10 inch Fire Tablet was reduced in price during the holidays in 2021, I decided it was time to make the jump to a larger screen (more (paper) book sized) and gain more battery ife per charge due to a larger battery.

This 10 incher did not disappoint at all. As a primary use for Kindle books, I'm getting 20 or more % battery life then the 12 hours the specs suggest this tablet can get.

The screen quality for reading is perfect. I typically set it to lower brightness (fixed) and there's no glare in the eyes nor any eye strain when using in a darkened bedroom at night.

The faster processor then my older 8 inch HD clearly adds some speed to anything you do on this tablet.

There's no lag at all in trying it for video, gaming, etc. As stated though, for me, I use a Fire Tablet primarily as a reader, period.

Screen resolution and contrast is excellent, certainly not any better ( and a little less) than my iPad PRO, but, of course we're talking a big difference in cost between tablets here and very different display technologies as well.

That said, this 10 inch HD Tablet is no slouch in offering a clear, sharp/detailed display with very sufficient color saturation and accuracy plus nice crisp text over-all.

Given Amazon offers just about any app needed for this fire Tablet, it certainly could be used for just about everything that an iPad could be and at a competitive price to the new basic model iPad model that sells in the $330+ dollar range now.

Some reviewers said due to where the camera is (oddly) located, one must use this Fire tablet in a case with the cover opening to the right rather then to the conventional left, but, not true. Since this tablet can flip screen orientation based on where the top of screen is located, I'm using a hard shell case for my Fire and the conventional left cover opening as normal. Granted the camera is at the bottom left corner in my configuration, but, that is no issue since if one needs to use the camera, they can orient the tablet however they wish and the screen (and camera) will orient as needed for photos.

The net here is you can use the tablet in a case and flip open the left cover as normal.

As an owner of both an iPad Mini and an iPad Pro 11 inch, I can say in all honesty, anyone wanting a tablet on a budget and hoping to get some decent performance and screen quality plus great battery life won't be disappointed at all in this new model 10 inch Fire Tablet.

I got the base 32 GB version with ads. Ads only show on the screen saver when opening up the sleep/wake cover and a one finger flip up of the screen goes back to where you left off or the home screen. Ads really are not a biggie in this context at all.

Given one can add a micro SD card to gain more storage space, and Micro SD cards are dirt cheap now, the 32GB version is fine for me.

No complaints at all and 5 stars all around for this Fire Tablet. A well designed tablet at a very good price.

I highly recommend it! If you order one, it'll be a definite ""keeper"".",positive
329,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Lavender",$129.99,5,"Just before Christmas in 2021, this item popped up on sale for just $75. We’re an apple family. We have numerous iPads in the house, plus our iPhones, Mac, MacBooks, Apple TV, etc. I’m an audio mixer, and use a product from Avid called the S1. It’s a control surface for Pro Tools that is meant to house a tablet for additional functionality- or eye candy. My older IPad worked, but looked tiny in the cradle, and wasn’t all that useable. I wanted something bigger, but didn’t want to spend the money on yet another iPad. For $75, I was willing to roll the dice.

It fits great, looks great, and does exactly what I bought it for.

But then I started to explore it deeper. It has built in Alexa with the wake word Amazon. As an audio engineer working from home, I sporadically have actors coming to record. I’ve got Ring doorbells at the entrances, and Echo devices in nearly every room. But for the first time, I can say “Amazon, show me the front door!”, and actually SEE it- and a lot faster than the Ring app on my phone would allow. This was a nice bonus. In fact, in my experience and opinion, Alexa works for much quicker and more reliably than Siri, that I’ve found myself relying on it a lot more. Having Alexa in the tablet to verbalize reminders, appointments, phone calls, etc- all right in front of me, is amazing!

I became fascinated with my new toy, and downloaded all the steaming media we subscribe to, plus other apps for news and weather that provide lots of content. I quickly found that I enjoyed watching tv on a 10 inch screen a lot more than on my iPhone. It’s nice to have lunch at the table with my kiddo and share a video we can both easily see and hear. So- this little guy has a great screen and works perfectly for watching shows, movies, YouTube, news, etc.

Now- I love my iPhone, and have my music library in iTunes. But when I purchase music, it’s always via Amazon. This is because I get my MP3 files instantly for most albums- but then have a physical disc arrive that often goes unopened. I just like know that HAVE the disc if I ever need to load it again or want to enjoy it in my stereo system. My iPhone can store a decent amount of music internally for when streaming isn’t an option. But I was floored to learn that the HD10 2021 has a micro SD card slot that can store up to 1 TB!!! That’s amazing to me. I can preload entire series, movies, music, photos- anything I need for a long trip or chilling in downtime. For like $25 I added a 400 gig card. Why iPads don’t have this is beyond me.

I work with and coach voice actors outside of my day job as a recording engineer. Having that much memory on a tablet and access to an app like WavePad, gives them the ability to record in a pinch while away from their studios. On-screen editing is also fun and easy. I actually added a nifty stylus and case to my HD10, along with a Bluetooth keyboard. It’s essentially a mobile studio, albeit limited.

While I haven’t experimented a ton with this- Silk browser (which seems to run on Chrome) allows me to use Source Connect Now to tap into actors or listen to sessions remotely at “CD quality”. Of course you can also use Zoom, Skype, etc.

As an apple user, I still want access to my ICloud apps, like Contacts, calendar, Pages, Keynote, Numbers, etc. You can log into your iCloud account and get it all. The trick is to choose “request desktop site”, otherwise you dead-end at “find my device”. You can even log into Apple Music via the browser. So all my apple stuff is still with me!

I chose Outlook email to run my various work and personal emails and have a unified calendar. It’s perfect for what I need.

For $75, I’m finding myself using it more than I have ever used my iPad. It’s the right screen size for me to actually be productive with it, while also having endless entertainment in reach. Add a case, keyboard and stylus- and you’re good to go!",positive
330,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 Kids tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, ages 3–7, 32 GB, Lavender",$169.99,4,"I bought this for my 3 year old and have had it for a couple of months now. Overall I really like it but there was a learning curve with the software. Here are my thoughts and experiences with it.

Pro's:
- Price is excellent if you can catch a sale.
- Case is very good. Great protection, good quality. I really like that they put thought into maximizing the sound with the case. The speakers are on the edge of the device and they make a cool curved area so that the sound from the speakers is redirected towards the user. Works very well.
- Battery life is really good.
- Curated list of age-appropriate content is very good.
- You can remove content as desired.
- Great warranty.
- As your child grows, the list of content and interface can grow with them. The main interface is optimized for either readers or non-readers and can be changed if your non-reader learns to read. The curated content is age-based, so as they age, the content remains appropriate for their age.
- You have control over age range of curated content. You can set it to whatever you want depending on where your particular child is developmentally. You can also set the range in terms on age range, too. Say your kid is 8, you can make just 8 year old content available, or ages 2-8, or 7-10. Whatever you want.

Con's
- Software could be a lot easier to manage for parents. Some of the content we wanted to remove. It's possible but it took me a few internet searches and some fumbling around in the software to find. I work in technology/software and am pretty savvy and it still wasn't easy.
- No button to show running apps, so you can't directly switch between apps without going to the home screen first.
- Hardware is pretty meh. It's all pretty basic, lower resolution screen, processor is on the lower end, body material is plastic and feels cheapish. RAM is ok at 3GB.
- Storage - only offering 32GB is inexcusable. It allows for very little content to be downloaded/cached on the device and will become a problem at some point for almost everyone. It should be 64GB as the base and they should offer 128GB as an upgrade. You're basically required to use an SD card since the 32GB is so small, most people would be fine if it cost a few bucks more and storage wasn't the problem it is now.

Other thoughts:
The software overall is really good in my opinion. It for sure needs to be more intuitive in regard to management for parents. However, my daughter has had no issues at all with using it herself. The interface is perfect for her age. It also includes some premium content as well through Kindle books and Nickelodeon shows/games. It's shows and characters she's already interested in, so all that content is fantastic.

Another surprise hit was the experiences available with many of the books, that there are options for the book to be read out loud to your child, or for them to read it, or for a parent to read it for them. A very thoughtful and useful feature. My daughter loves having the books narrated for her and is helping in her progress toward learning to read.

Some reviews have mentioned issues with certain apps, including ABC Mouse. We use that one a lot and have had no issues whatsoever. I assume that issues other reviewers had in the past have been resolved by software updates.

When you first dive into this ecosystem, it can be a bit overwhelming. There's a lot of features and settings, as well as content. After learning how to use and manage it, I can say that I really like it and there's nothing currently on the market that's as good of an end to end experience. I highly recommend giving it a try and stick with it as you work to understand everything. Once you've got it figured out, it's pretty easy to manage and great for kids.",positive

We replaced an older ipad with this hoping it would have decent options for my son (4 years old) to play with but without the constant ads and purchase prompting. He would get frustrated because every minute or so on the ipad he'd have to watch an ad or click wrong trying to close it and go down an ad-ridden rabbit hole.

The Fire Kids tablet has a lot of the same games (particularly the Sonic running game), but with the Fire Kids, there's no ads/popups/purchases constantly and he can simply play the games.

The battery life is amazing. Every time I check it expecting it to be dead, it still has 60-70% life left. It charges with a USB-C cable, so its the same as the rest of my new devices.

But….the first one we got was the smaller version with bouncier foam padding so we wanted to give that one to the younger sibling. That was the hard part. The easy part was moving the first child’s profile from the old one to the new one. The hard part was figuring out how to add another profile to the original tablet. We really don’t have any use for switching between profiles because as a family we have enough devices to go around. The tablet makes it so that you need a PIN number to exit the child mode and get into the settings. I don’t ever see a situation where this is going to be something they try to access. Anyway finally was able to add another profile and we just allow them to stay logged on. Then all you have to do is turn the screen off when not in use.,positive

The options can get a bit overwhelming but that's digital parenting for you. My only beef with this tablet is that it wont read an ExFAT formatted microSD card (the kind that are specifically made for this tablet and sell with it). It SHOULD read ExFAT, but it will only read MS-DOS(FAT)/FAT32. I don't think this is a global problem since most people seem to have no problem mounting the ""sold separately but made for Amazon Fire"" SanDisk microSD cards. I bought a 128GB card to go with this tablet and it didn't mount in the system at all. I tried reformatting it on my computer thinking it was the card, and it still wouldn't work. Finally I tried formatting it to MS-DOS(FAT) and that worked (though now I'm limited to 4GB on file sizes). I saw other people on the SanDisk microSD page leaving questions and reviews about how the cards weren't working and I'm pretty sure it's not the card, it's this tablet. My computer was reading the card just fine, and I tried various other microSD cards that I've used in other tablets, cameras, and Fires and those also only worked if they were MS-DOS(FAT) formatted. Any ExFAT formatted card just wouldn't work, SanDisk or not. So that leaves the tablet. I wouldn't let that stop you from purchasing one of these, but just know that if you try to mount a microSD card and it doesn't work, you'll want to exchange the tablet immediately instead of wasting your time with SanDisk trying to replace the card.",positive

UPDATED REVIEW : 28 August 2022
------------------------
Regret.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but definitely once you hit its limitations.

TLDR : Child can never have their own Amazon account without credit card information and proof of residence in THEIR name. So you can never buy apps on their own account for later use. Apps are non-transferable. #Regret

My kiddo has a Furby Connect toy, the app will not work in kids mode as it requires location services to be active. There is no override for this. Other apps we wanted to install were also complaining. We were also wanting to purchase apps which would have a longer lifespan and any in-app purchases on the actual child account will be lost as they age and obtain their own account anyway.

Other issues with the kids mode, the tablet grows considerably slower with time, adding in an SD card still triggers an error about the tablet being full even though there is room, you just have to say ok and try to ""ignore"" it.

So, easy fix right?
Set up an account for the child, load account with gift card, for the games which that were played the most on Kids+ - purchase those apps on the new account, lock everything down with an external app such as Kaspersky Kids.

Step 1. Create Gmail account purely for use on tablet

Step 2. Factory Reset tablet to set up with single ""adult"" account

Step 3. Create Amazon account for child

Step 4. Spend considerable time and effort setting up tablet with already purchased apps from Google Play and other free apps from the Amazon App store.

Step 5. Lastly, add Credit card for purchases on Amazon account.
Purchase first app on tablet.
Amazon Account locked.

Unusual activity detected on account.
Please wait 24H for someone to be in contact.
Wut ?

Tablet is completely inaccessible.

Right ok so ...

Step 4. Factory reset....

Step 5. Make another account for child.

Step 6. Spend the rest of the day setting up the account.

Step 7. Buy $25 gift card for new account with your own Amazon account

Step 8. Redeem $25 gift code on account for tablet

Step 9. Things seem to be working fine. Child asks for one more app she used to enjoy.
Try to add app.

Step 9. Account locked.

Unusual activity detected on account.
Please wait 24H for someone to be in contact.

.... wa wa wa.

Step 10. Contact Amazon Support.

- Be transferred to Kindle Support

- Beg and Please for Amazon to unlock tablet account for child.
-- Support person asks if I had already redeemed the voucher

// About to answer ""Yes""
// Browser update force closes browser, minor cursing.

- Resume chat (Thank a higher power for that)
-- Assigned new kindle support person.

- New support person claims to read chat.

The new support person wasn't even understanding my problem, I needed the account unlocked and they started to talk me through doing a factory reset.

At this point I lost my cool.

Expletives were expressed.

Tagged out and other half tags in.

Chat goes around in circles whilst Amazon requests that we send in Proof of Address and Credit Card information for the account holder and the explanation of ""Child is 4 and does not have a credit card, or actual proof of address for that matter, we are the parents, why can we not just enter our card information?""

We are told to submit the information and wait 24H.

Obviously my child does not own a credit card or receive any bills in their name and therefore this becomes an unsolvable paradox. I am now sitting with a locked account I can't unlock and a redeemed $25 gift card redeemed on that account as well. This is nothing short of BLATANT THEFT.

Step .......
OMG. Don't do it, just don't.

We went the very next day and purchased an Samsung A7 Lite instead.
Huawei would have been the better choice due to Samsung's bloatware, but thanks to their fragile stance with the Google Play store, they are best left alone for now.

For those interested in my original, higher rated review, find that below...

PREVIOUS REVIEW : June 13, 2021
------------------------
Amazing -- Provided You Have No Interest In Previous In-App Purchases

It's amazing! So what's to dislike?

Well not much tbh, but I've mentioned two reasons below, so you can decide for yourselves whether or not this would be a deal breaker for you.

TLDR;
CONS
#1 -- No extension option on lock
#2 -- No support of previous in-app purchases

PROS
#1 -- Interface that adjusts to age range
#2 -- Full parental control and remote access to tablet through Amazon account
#3 -- Year free of Kids+
#4 -- Very responsive and durable
#5 -- Support for shared apps such as Netflix and Plex

-------------------

#1
One obvious missing features (for me anyway), is an ""extension"" button.
There was an option for that on the leap pad epic when it locked, where you could extend the time for a set window, be it 15 or 30 minutes. Seriously how often does your child ask, ""Just 15 more minutes"". This would be a seriously useful feature and I can't believe it isn't here.

To extend the time, you actually need to change the time when the device will lock on a general basis, which is covered by only two tabs, weekdays and weekends. Also, Friday night is not counted as part of the weekend, so even if you set the device to lock a little later on weekends, be advised that you'll be in for a fight on Sunday night.

Thing is, once I change the time to say 6:15pm, to allow for that extra ""15 minutes"", I then have to remember to change it back before the following night as otherwise it will only lock at 6:15pm and adding on an extra begged-for 15 minutes would then be 6:30pm. The child obviously won't understand this mistake and you end up in a loop of doom. Just unnecessary admin really.

You can however adjust this remotely within your Amazon account itself and I have pulled this off before when I've remembered with just minutes to spare. Still, no one wants to be James Bond all the time and overall, just not a good user experience. The pause and resume buttons within the parent dashboard, as useful as they seem, do not override the bedtime controls. So thinking that I could just ask the tablet to resume and then manually pause it again 15 minutes later is also a no-go.

#2
Have you previously done in-app purchases and effectively purchased the full version of a game that you would like to share with your child? In-App full version purchases such as those required by Bimi Boo and Pink Fong...

Well sadness is that they simply don't work, your child has to play on the account with which the in-app purchases took place and this defeats the purpose as this is the adult account. Even though you share the apps with the child account, only the free version is shared and not the full version. It is at this point where you begin getting keyboard imprints on your face.

I sat on an amazon help desk chat for well over an hour, was transferred 5 times and they promised to help me and then the last agent being at the actual app store, my final stop, disconnected without initiating the chat. Further keyboard imprints take place.

During that support process I was told I would need to change my child out of the 3-5 age range in order for them to work, not something I wanted to do as it bypassed parental controls for that age group and at the end of the exercise, it was not something that worked anyway. I was then advised to remove and re-add the account, that too did not work. I eventually contacted the creators of Bimi Boo and they told me that the Amazon App store doesn't support the sharing of in-app purchases, I would need to take up the matter with Amazon themselves.

I simply haven't had the energy to revisit this. I do think the only way to do so however, is to be refunded and then do the in-app purchases a second time through the actual device itself. The device is assigned it's own kindle address, but is not otherwise associated with an email address of its own. So I'm not even entirely sure how in-app purchases would work here either.

Anyway, that is $60.00 or so of previously purchased apps which I cannot use unless I repurchase -- gah. I would love to otherwise transfer ownership to that device somehow -- Not like I bought those apps for me anyway.

Rant aside. This is an amazing little device, it is wonderfully responsive and the Kids+ selection is beyond amazing. Everything there is full version and the only 'coins' needed are those you earn in-game. My three year old loves the ""My Hungry Caterpillar"" game where you feed him, play with him and put him to bed for a period of days until he then turns into a beautiful butterfly; after which the whole process begins again. Another firm favourite is ""Little Fox Animal Doctor"" where you cure a number of very cute little characters who are ailing from various illnesses and accidents.

The tablet includes a year free of Kids+ and for a monthly cost of $5 a month, it is definitely worth it for the quality of content, lots of Disney apps too.

My favourite thing about this tablet is that the interface changes based on the age group.
The current group my daughter is in, 3-5 has only images, the next group up 6-12 a has large images and text, finally the teen group pretty much looks as it does in the adult mode. This would actually make a mighty fine Android tablet all on it's own.

In conclusion, other than the cons mentioned above, this is a very worthwhile purchase.",negative

First, the battery life is fantastic. The Fire 7 would drain its battery in a single day if not left on a charger. I tried messing with every setting without success. The kids use the new Fire 8 for a while, leave it off, then use again, and it's still at like 90% charge the next day.

2nd, there is finally a setting for volume control limits!!!! This was the biggest cause of arguments. 2 kids who want their tablet the loudest. Now you can limit the volume.

USB-C charging, so I think I can finally get rid of my micro-USB cables and use the same USBC i have for everything else already.

32GB will definitely come in handy. I was constantly being warned on the old tablets about full memory, but most of the junk you cannot clear out. The only way to fix them was factory reset, and then they would fill up again. Between kids taking videos and instantly downloading any app they click on, memory gets chewed up fast.

Finally, transferring all data from the previous fire to the new one was so easy. No cables required.

One wish - that Amazon would not let them download any app immediately without anything but a single touch. They don't understand the concept of ROM. Sometimes they push things by accident and I have to uninstall it.",positive

This one, on the other hand, stays charged for several days, doesn't lag (opening up youtube videos on the other one would end up in this annoying loop of trying to play the video and stopping, but this one is pretty much instant) I think it's double the RAM so that makes sense. My non-verbal toddler has become very good at using this device and can navigate what he wants to do on his own, and it's nice to see him excel at something when he is delayed in everything else. We don't yet know for sure if he is on the spectrum but for parents stuck in that waiting period of testing this has been really good when it comes to choosing what he wants to do and other skills.

They can also have books for reading and it’s awesome I can share some of my books with them as well. Over all I love it, very family friendly and useful in a variety of ways. The bumper on this is amazing too. I was skeptical of tablets for kids but I’m glad we gave this a try.

Now he likes to story’s and watches some pbs shows. For the prime day price I’ll say it’s worth it, but normal full price I’m not sure. Below is a more in depth review
Pros:
I like the kid friendly settings. There is one setting that allows you setup the tablet interface for a younger child( one that can’t read) or one for a child that can. Also like the selection of apps and books. I think specs for the price is good, and the case bundled with the tablet is great. The interactive Dr. Seuss books are a hit with my son, and great for him to start exploring books on his own.
Cons:
The app permission setting is a slight miss for me, I put it to where the child can download something’s but idk what constitutes as something he can or cannot download. I also don’t like that there is a subscription, it’s cheap for prime members 4.99 a month and I think 7 for non prime members. But I think it should be included in the prime membership already. Finally the last con, the possibility of some apps or books not being available if I don’t continue the subscription.",positive

Why better than an iPad? Well, on an iPad, young kids frequently hit the button on the front or the screen, bumping themselves out of their activities and need assistance getting back in... While the design of the Fire Tablets (buttons all on the side) coupled with the design of the kids' case (thick edge to hold, without touching the screen by accident) eliminates accidentally getting bumped out of an activity by just holding the unit the wrong way!",positive

She was very excited to see it after I set it up and let it charge. However, we quickly noticed that some of the Amazon Prime Video content she loved and watched on our other tablet was for some reason not available on this Fire kids tablet. I’m talking kids shows such as Blue’s Clues and Bubble Guppies. Instead, you have to add individual videos of those shows (if they are available) from YouTube by going through the settings. I had to watch a YouTube video tutorial to figure out how to do it. The other con is the battery life. It’s supposed to get 12 hours with reasonable use, but I find it gets closer to 6-8. Not a big deal as we always have a charger with us, but something to consider if your child will be primarily using this to watch movies on long trips.
Otherwise, this tablet is excellent. It is very kid friendly and comes with so much content that you would otherwise have to pay for on a different device. We were able to download HBOMAX and Disney+ without any issues. I love knowing my daughter can’t accidentally access the internet and find herself places she shouldn’t be. There is so much downloadable content that it is still usable even when WiFi isn’t available. Overall, we are very happy with our purchase.",positive

360,Computers & Accessories,"TP-Link Deco WiFi 6 Mesh System(Deco X20) - Covers up to 5800 Sq.Ft. , Replaces Wireless Routers and Extenders(3-Pack, 6 Ethernet Ports in total, supports Wired Ethernet Backhaul)",$179.99,5,"I just came back from the park. I brought an inverter to power the SONOFF TH10. I brought an Android 9 phone to pretend to be the Deco SSID. I use another Android 10 phone to pair the smart switch. This is my last resort to pair it. It worked and continue to work after I brought it home.

I thought the Deco worked pretty well until I realized that the weather has been perfect for a few days. I had several TH10 to be temperature sensors for my HVAC system. They didn't connect and couldn't be paired again. I was panicking and pray for the weather to stay perfect.

There are many reasons that it's very hard to pair again. And it's not only Deco. But I would call it iDeco in the same league as iDevices. And that with Apple in the way, the psychiatrist is never far away.

There is something called Smart Connect that you are forced to use in the iDeco. You can have only one, single, uno, un, yi, SSID. The idea is that Deco will connect to the device in the best band, 2.4 GHz, and one of the two 5 GHz bands. Deco is not tri-band. It doesn't use both 5 GHz bands simultaneously. But how possibly does it work? I don't think it's a new standard. It's not up to Deco. The phone will scan and connect to the strongest signal even with the same SSID. The 2.4 GHz has the advantage. I almost returned it when I saw my phone connected to the lower band. But after some observations, it seems that all the 5 GHz capable devices all connect to the higher band, which should be the case as the interference at the 2.5 GHz band is terrible here.

The 1st problem is those cheap smart things that use little bandwidth stay at the 2.4 GHz tech. All of my switches from different manufacturers only support 2.4. My phone will connect to 5. So the Sonoffs won't pair. I have no control over which band the phone connects to.

You can have 2nd guest SSID but the guest network is isolated from the main network. The Deco replaced my three router tree that is increasingly difficult to pair new devices. The Sonoffs may be connected to the same SSID on different routers. I was hoping the Deco mesh appears to the Sonoffs as one router.

Is that easy just to turn off the 5 GHz band during pairing? To my horror, you can't turn off any band. You are just turning off the broadcasting of the SSID. Any devices that already have the SSID can still connect.

Of course, I can still connect to the 2 GHz band if I forget the SSID and reconnect. But the 2 GHz band here is jammed solid. I have to use two APs at the front and back of the house with an ethernet backhaul. All the APs are wired to the cable internet source. They not actually ethernet cables but modems turning unused TV cables in the house into ethernet. But the modems are limited to 100 Mbps from years ago. Now I am paying for 150 Mbps. Instead of upgrading that I opted for a wifi 6 mesh.

My 3 Deco's are pretty good in putting a wifi shield around my house that no neighbors' signals can penetrate. Even the internet speed at 2 GHz is pretty fast and reliable instead of unusable before. But the Deco occupies two channels so that you can't do much from channel 1 to 8. And the rest are belong to my neighbors. You can't move it around. And I don't see how it can adapt when there are three Deco's subject to different interferences.

Wifi pairing is always tricky because to be simple you have to give out your password to eWelink. For the Sonoff's newer quick pairing mode, the device is looking for a secret SSID, 12345678 with the password abcabcab. The app asks the phone to generate a hotspot with the SSID and the password so it can communicate with the device. After the device downloaded the normal login credentials, the app deletes the hotspot and connects to the normal SSID. But the iPhone would never have allowed that and you can't do that in Android 10 anymore. But that's the default mode when you power up the IoT device. Until the newer devices use BT pairing.

Anyway, I don't think the 2 GHz from the phone here is good enough to finish pairing. The last resort is the old compatibility mode where the device becomes an AP in channel 7! It's always channel 7. I never saw it moves. Are you that lucky always? But this Sonoff AP always crashes with the Deco AP. If I have to add another AP to make another SSID to test things, I will be running out of clean bandwidth at 2 GHz. The only thing I can do is to wait until everybody sleeps and unplug all the Deco's. But I rather go to the park.

I also think you have to delete the device from the app first before you pair it again as some info will be stored in the cloud. Maybe you can try the secret SSID first to unstuck some old bits. The quick pairing mode works in the park.

You have absolutely no web-based control panel like DD-WRT. The one there is just for show.

I stayed with the Deco because my problems are solved. Except that Smart Life doesn't allow me to edit any device from time to time. I have no idea. I read that some satellites limit the bandwidth to like 60% of the ISP bandwidth. Whereas my Deco's are about the same 130 Mbps (Netflix) vs 150 Mbps for the ISP.

And also each Deco has two ethernet ports whereas some others have only one. So I need 3 mesh devices to give me one cable modem connection, one game connection, and one internet phone connection, and no more. Yes, I have plenty of old routers to split the ethernet ports but they are still in the 70's!

Original review:

I needed to upgrade. Speed isn't the main issue as I'm only willing to pay my ISP for a 150 Mbps connection, enough for more than one 4K streaming and many zooms. I considered a tri-band one because of the interference from neighbors. But wifi 6 cost extra less than going out for a meal. I'm not sure it's a better decision. But my current 5 GHz APs, D-Link AC750s, have dates in the 1970s because they are too old, the dates wrapping around. The Deco will see some new wifi 6 devices added to the house.

Installation is easy. All Deco's are identical with a power socket and two ethernet sockets, identical and bi-directional. Each can be used as a satellite or the main router. Basically, you plug it in, open the app and give it the SSID, password, and security mode.

Easy except that the hardware and software are more Apple-like than I prefer. I was distracted when I installed the main router. Then I couldn't find a way to install the 2nd Deco. After I exhausted the menus, I found that it's the + sign. Silly me, or is it? I was also distracted when I added the last Deco. The app said I didn't finish but the LED said yes. There's no way you can see how many Deco's you have in your network. Instead of being driven crazy often by Apple products, I let go.

Hours later when I accidentally tapped on the globe icon, with a label saying internet, all my connected Deco's appeared. Silly me, or is it?

The signal strength is a bit stronger. That's not the point as I can jack up the signal killing my neighbors'. It looks like that I can use only one Deco to replace my DIY mesh network, except for a room in the middle of the 2nd floor that is somewhat less than the ISP speed. I think if your house isn't that large, and your ISP speed isn't that great, you can just put a satellite Deco where you need speed. Because the max speed is much faster, like 1 Gbps, and the ISP connection is only 150 Mbps, the wireless Deco connections are as good as wired ethernet. You don't need to use an ethernet backhaul. I have speeds at the 5 GHz band from over 100 Mbps to 120 Mbps. Netflix says 130 Mbps.

Surprisingly, you can only have one SSID for both bands. My phone automatically connects to the 2.4 GHz band that is much slower because of neighbors' interference. The only way out seems to set up a guest network for the 2.4 GHz band only and the main network for the 5 GHz only. Use a different SSID for each one so you can select.

This Apple-like feature almost made me return it. I wasted my time using the guest network for a different SSID for a different band. The IoT switches work but they route via the internet. The guest network is isolated from the main. So I can't see the IP cameras on the 2.4 GHz band when my phone is normally connected to the 5 GHz band.

When I searched further, this feature isn't uncommon. It's like a sort of handover between the two bands. You need both bands because the 2.4 GHz travels further while the 5 GHz band has much more bandwidth. But I don't think there is a standard protocol to select one of the bands. The Deco can't force a device to change bands. It depends on the device to pick the best band.

When I have the same SSID on two different 2.4 GHz channels, the stronger one will be picked and it simply makes sense. But it's a disaster if any device picks one of the bands based on signal strength. Comparing the signal strength of the two bands is like comparing apples to oranges. I was alarmed when my phone connects to the 2.4 GHz band and I have no way of making it change.

After observing the Deco for days, I conclude that devices that need fast data connect to the 5 GHz band. Most desktops, laptops, and phones connect to the 5 GHz band eventually.

The conventional router settings are still there but a lot less. Perhaps you don't need to with the content filters and parental controls. To change the DNS server, you need to tap on the dynamic IP setting, and then edit it to see the DNS address.

The content filters depend on the Trend Micro and the Deco database, which is not as reliable as the OpenDNS database. But you can add individual url's. As for parental control, there is a time limit on each device that is hard to program on older devices. There are also bedtime settings so it's rather enough for kids.

For my classic RT-N16, with DD-WRT on you can program it as a Linux computer. I used to have a timetable for games and other fun sites when switching to different DNS filters automatically. With the automation feature of the Deco, it looks like it can do something like that. You can do something when some devices connect to the mesh or at a specific time, but there's nothing much to set.

It's not easy to see what websites are connected to anymore. Though the top ones are listed on the monthly reports. If you want to know you need to set the DNS to something like OpenDNS so you can see the website logs.

For the Deco, it's MAC-based filtering so you can easily tell which devices are connected and give them a meaningful name. The RT-N16 wasn't able to install a MAC filter so I have to set up a table of IP reservations manually and then setup filters on the static IP addresses. But my RT-N16 isn't reliable anymore. It crashes once in a few months and lost all data. I have to restore backups that aren't always updated. And the last time I thought I couldn't power it up anymore.

Do I need that high speed? I think I can pay a lot less going for 50 Mbps at my ISP. But I need better wifi to deal with interference from my neighbors. I need either a good mesh or an ethernet backhaul. I did have an ethernet backhaul. All my wifi AP's are connected by ethernet. But it's not direct ethernet cables. They are TV cables with ethernet modems on both ends. I had them when the 5 GHz band began to be crowded. I had two to finally four AP or routers, ethernet connected via TV cable.

But with wifi 6 mesh this good we can save a lot of money by sharing the ISP with neighbors. Each house only needs one Deco and we can share the 150 Mbps or higher among as many houses as we want.

The TV cable modem adaptors I have are cheap and limited to 100 Mbps. The faster ones are not worthwhile until I have a gigabyte ISP connection. This is the main reason I go for better wifi to get my worth of the 150 Mbps ISP connection.

Do I need a mesh? Probably not for an average 3 bedroom. The newer routers seem to handle interference well at the 5 GHz band. It's also better at 2.4 GHz. They use a wideband, 40 MHz instead of 20 MHz.

But I always have a DIY mesh. You can actually use the same SSID on two different AP's. It works seamlessly on two different channels without overlapping. Though it's not a seamless handover, you have to disconnect manually and reconnect if it doesn't disconnect automatically due to poor signal. Though it's a lot easier for the kids instead of using different SSIDs depending on where they are.

The front and back of the house are subject to different interfering signals. With only one AP I have to suffer all of them. With two AP and two channels, I suffer only half. It worked well until the 5 GHz channels are crowded too. I suppose the older AP's at 5 GHz doesn't work as well with newer AP's with newer devices.

With a 3-Deco mesh at 2.4 GHz, I won't worry about dead zones for the IoT and outside cameras. They are a fraction of the ISP connection but very reliable now across the house. Maybe one or two can do it, but since I got three already, I don't bother to sell one of them.",positive

Our 1975 tinker toy construction (drywall/plywood) L-Shaped, single-story ranch 2300 sqft home has a crawl space under the footprint with an attached 3 car garage and backyard patio/swimming pool area.

The 5800 sqft wi-fi coverage (overall average wi-fi data rates = 500 Mbps includes smartphones) is more than adequate for our needs (no gaming, 2 TVs (family room and garage) with 5 Alexa Plus/Echo Dots, roaming smartphones/GEN 6 laptop, desktop, multiple switches/plugs, Xfinity/Comcast owned Home Security router and irrigation controllers).

We tested the Deco X-68 (2-pack) with dedicated 5GHz tri-band, finding the Home Security upgrade solicitations to be annoying vs the lifetime included Home Security bundled with the X-20 (very good). Since we have a crawl space, wiring backhaul CAT 7 cable (chosen if ISP plan ever exceeds 1 GIG) through a TP-Link unmanaged 5-Port switch made longer term usage/performance sense. Note: also connected TP-Link USB/Ethernet adapter to switch for HP Pavilion Desktop (ethernet adapter only 100 Mbps)...increased wi-fi data rate from 250 Mbps to wired 500 Mbps. Aside: The Mrs wasn't thrilled to call the local Fire Department because I was stuck trying to get out of the crawl space!

900-600-300-(50%)

900 = ISP subscription signal data rate directly from Arris SB8200 cable modem to desktop and laptop. ALERT: The cable modem has 2 1-Gigabit ports, but ONLY 1 is operational unless you upgrade your Comcast subscription plan (not knowing cost me a lot of time plus the Comcast technician during his visit didn't even comment on this condition...""we don't troubleshoot 3rd party equipment"" Oh you don't? = I collected $250 in refunds FROM Comcast during this installation process) Suggestion: We put a book cover around cable modem on bookcase to hide it, but it's still accessible if we need to manually reboot (see photo).

600 = Signal loss (300 Mbps) connecting cable modem to Main Deco and backhaul ethernet cable wiring 2 nodes/satellites. Both our desktop and Lenovo Gen 6 laptop speed test at 600 Mbps by each Deco X-20 location. Note: Gen 6 laptop ""wi-fi data rate"" is also 600 Mbps at each location which implies the Gen 6 new standards firmware is performing well. Also smartphone Pixel 3A XL wi-fi roaming throughout house speed tests at 500 Mbps.

300 = Signal loss (300 Mbps) speed testing wi-fi on the Gen 6 laptop in remote areas: Garage & Patio areas performing at 300 Mbps

50% Loss Non-Wired Backhaul = Using the Deco X-20 routers to transmit ISP signal through its 4 antenna/radios vs backhaul wiring, decreases signal by 50% at all locations...ie signal in Garage by Android TV drops from 300 Mbps to 150Mbps (basically triggered decision to run ethernet cables or reinvestigate tri-band solutions)

Deco APP = Extremely well designed, absolute piece O cake to use. Provides me all I need to manage the entire network (connected devices/mac addresses/connected frequency rate (2.4 vs 5)/locations/wired not wired) by online/offline plus separate listing by locations) Easily reboot All Decos, optimize network, turn on/off Guest Network (works well with Alexa skill) to include 2.4GHz and/or 5GHz signals+++ = Just terrific!

TP Link Support = 24/7 phone support with very caring and generally very competent technical troubleshooting. I made a very costly set-up error by testing QoS (Quality of Service) by entering 100 Mbps download (I recommended to TP-Link about adding WARNING for this input) because it basically puts a governor on your real available data rates. Xfinity and I got tired proving I was getting the subscription rate we are paying for!

Bottom Line = For our installation and needs, we couldn't be more ecstatic with the upgraded High-Efficiency/High-Value mesh routers for $220. Note: Switch, USB/Ethernet adapter, CAT 7 cables = $75

What triggered this entire project was our purchase of a Gen 6 enabled Lenovo laptop. Of note, BOTH your router and connected device need 802.11ax or Gen 6 chip sets to tap OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)/RU (Resource Units) efficiency and WPA3 security (160 MHz channels (not supported in X-20) and MU-MIMO (Multi-user, Multiple Input, Multiple Output = currently vaporware) adds nothing to our WLAN performance needs). I believe, although cannot unequivocally test, the Gen 6 enhanced data rates are performing extremely well. All other legacy devices are solid with the new available signal strength and strong data rates near the 3 APs (Access Points). Our Orbit hose/timer up the back hill tucked under the redwood trees receives 75 Mbps!

6E chip set devices will be rapidly appearing in the marketplace over the next few years. You need BOTH the router and device to include 6E chipsets to utilize the new 1200 MHz, 6Ghz ""pristine spectrum"". As we Long Term Evolve (LTE), our new Deco X-20 (3-pack) will easily last 3 years or longer as our devices are steadily upgraded to 6E.

My kids were always complaining that they got horrible WiFi signal on the second floor. I thought we would not possibly need 3 units in our fairly small home, but if you have an old house with walls that block WiFi, don't rely on the square footage that the units say they will cover -- plan for one unit per room! Our main X20 unit is on our first floor. I put the second X20 in one child's room. My kids' rooms are right next to each other, and quite small, so I thought one node would handle both. But we used a WiFi mapping program, and while the first child's bedroom was all green now, the second bedroom was still mostly orange/red. So we put the third unit in the second bedroom, and now it is all green.

Setup couldn't have been easier out of the box. I used the provided ethernet cable to connect one Deco X20 to my Verizon FIOS router, and followed the setup steps in the app and had it up and running in minutes.

Also used a second ethernet cable to connect the Deco to our old AirPort Time Capsule, so that we can continue doing wireless backups via Time Machine.

We previously tried a TP-Link range extender, but were unhappy with it because it seemed to cut the upload and download speeds by about half.

I liked the eero software. I decided to try the TP-Link Deco WIFI 6 which is about the equivalent in functionality and price. The Deco has one major advantage in that each of the units can have a direct Ethernet connection to devices. Not possible with the eero 6. Only the unit designated as the router had an ethernet port. But the big difference was the speeds. I am paying for 300 Mbps service from Xfinity. Both the eero and the Deco show speeds out of the modem well above the 300 level. Varying between 320 and 350. But that is where the similarity ends. With the eero I was getting Siri speeds between 60 and 150 Mbps. With the Deco I am getting a consistent 180 to 210. And my Mac Mini M1 is connected by Ethernet to one of the Decos (not possible with the eero) and I am consistently getting over 300 Mbps! That's about twice the speed I was getting from the eero.

I liked the eero software a little bit more than the Deco. The Deco allows for a lot more advanced configuration, but right now I don't see a need. The eero interface seems a bit more intuitive. When it comes to the basics they both seem to cover the same turf.

Deco comes with Home Shield free for life. Home Shield Pro is an $55 per year. I think the basic plan will be sufficient for my needs. The eero Secure plan is $30 per year. They have no free plan. They have a $99 subscription which adds an additional three tools. I already subscribe to 1Password and use the free version of Malwarebytes, but if I didn't, this bundle would be a good deal. But, the Deco system is so much faster, has the Ethernet ports, and comes with an adequate security systems build in for life. So for me, it was an easy decision.

The main thing to know is to connect the first ""pod"" (or whatyoumaycallit) with your modem. It took me awhile to realize that because there's only one extra cord that doesn't match any of the others, and that one connects the modem to the first of three identical ""pods"". From there, you're asked for a network name ; and then for a password. It's suggested that you use the same name and password that you used for the old connection to save having to type everything in three times, but I must have had a character wrong and ended up typing this all in for each ""pod"" anyway.

Even in bridge mode it would not work. After much research I learned that routers need to be designed to do this. But then most of the mesh routers are designed to create a single wifi network wirelessly. Due to the design of my house a wireless mesh network would not create good signals everywhere. I had already run ethernet cable from my basement where the cable enters to the front of the house. Using this ethernet cable it was easy to set up the network. As others have said, first pair the units wirelessly before connecting by ethernet. Signal strength is very strong. Two units likely would have been enough for my house - but the third is nice to have.",positive

TLDR: Even with a two-year-old AC WiFi router, we had spotty coverage, dropped signals, added an internet extender, changed channels, and it still was irritating. Bought the Deco X20 system and it has been great with full, fast WiFi everywhere.

We had a decent, two-year-old, brand name, AC WiFi router before these TP-Link mesh routers, but it could not cover the whole house in WiFi. Working from home or wanting to use a tablet in a bedroom or the basement just accented the existing issues.

In our new home, we had placed our modem and router in our office as working from home was the priority. The office is a addition to our 1950s brick home and the interior walls in the rest of the house are plaster, likely having a wire lath creating a faraday cage, all of which makes WiFi spotty at best. I did not want to have our Internet company come out to rerun wires and have an ugly bunch of tech mounted high on our walls (especially the living room, kitchen, or dining room).

There are rules in technology:
Don't cover or hide it as it needs air for cooling; put it antennas up high for a better signal; it needs several dangling, twisted cords to make it work; it has to be black so it stands out against everything; and every device must have at least two bright LED search lights and at least one or more of those have to blink in crazy non-sequential patterns. At night, these lights must be able to be seen from space (I am looking at you, Oral-B toothbrushes and charging cables with tiny LED bulbs). Flashing bright lights on a prisoner is a form of torture. We do it willingly.

I purchased a band name $50 mesh extender that would randomly disconnect glowing red, there were still dead zones, and the basement and back bedrooms were constantly having connection issues. WiFi is a bit like drifting air currents that flow in and out of an area, not the strong concentric rings radiating out as you see in diagrams. Our neighbor's WiFi could have been causing problems, so I downloaded software to measure my signal and channels. I watched my signals go from great to noting and back up again for no clear reason.

Spectrum kept telling us that their modem and lines were great and it was our setup after their modem that made us get 6 Mbps (dial up speeds) to 65 Mbps rather than 100 Mbps, even when the computer was near the router.

This all changed with this TP-Link Deco WiFi 6 Mesh WiFi System (Deco X20).
The three white mesh towers are exactly the same; each are 4"" in diameter and almost 5"" tall, about the size of a 32 oz can, and they are attractive so it isn't a problem to have them out where they can be seen. If you buy the set, they are already configured to each other, so you plug in the power cord to the mesh towers (repeaters) where you want them and it is done. There are no dead zones in our house now and we get speeds of 60 Mbps (old phone) to 112 Mbps everywhere. I didn't rate the tech support as I haven't needed it.

I have an older laptop at the far end of the house, to upgrade it, I bought a new USB mesh networking antenna, and even being in the same room didn't help my signal too much. I moved the TP-Link Deco mesh tower (wireless, not network wired) near my computer and used a network cable to connect it to my laptop. I just ran a speed test and I am getting 114 Mbps on a 100 Mbps internet connection.

I can even set the times that the mesh towers show their LED lights, so one of these can even be in your bed room and not light up the night.

Is TP-Link reliable? I know that was my concern. My brother was the Technology Director for a nationally known company. He used TP-Link equipment regularly, expecting it to last a short while, but they tended to outlast and perform as well as the far more expensive, bigger brand names.

I am glad that I bought these.

The fact they do not have google assistant or other verbal interface integration was a plus to me, as I do not want systems always listening. I think we are going to find these types of ""servant"" technologies being hacked or not working towards our best interests. The IOT is useful, but more often it is shorthand for idIOT.",positive
370,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 Plus tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Slate",$159.99,5,"This is my third Kindle Fire device. I had the HDX for years then gifted it to my son. I then ordered the 8 Plus most recently and have generally enjoyed it. However, as someone that has a giant phone with me, I came to realize that the screen just wasn’t big enough to justify using it regularly. Enter the new HD 10 Plus with its larger screen. My assumption was that, for the most part, this would basically be a larger version the 8. Generally, my assumption was correct but Amazon did a very nice job of tweaking some areas that desperately needed it. I will detail some of those tweaks here but, at its core, this tablet is still very much just a very reasonably priced entertainment device. I think some folks misunderstand the intent from Amazon here. The Fire line up is designed to meet the demands of most tablet owner’s needs; streaming music, streaming Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix, handling emails, general web browsing and more. I know, Amazon is offering a “productivity bundle” here and it is nice to see Amazon trying to make these more flexible but, make no mistake, there is a reason that companies like Apple and Samsung charge so much more for their devices. However, if you aren’t expecting an iPad like experience, I think most folks should be genuinely happy with the HD 10 Plus. It does an awful lot incredibly well! Here is the breakdown:

-The Screen: One of my biggest complaints about the Fire 8 Plus was the screen. It felt dull and lifeless to me. Functional and fine for a movie or bopping around online indoors but not a vibrant experience. Part of the issue is, so many of us have phones with these crazy perfect panels on them now. HD+, FHD+, WQHD+, and more! Plus, some of have adaptive refresh rates. I mean these screens are amazing today! These phones often cost over $1,000. So, for devices that retail at less than $250, it would not be fair to expect that level of screen quality. That being said, Amazon has definitely improved things here. We get 1080p HD and the screen does not feel as laggy or slow to me. Further, it is noticeably brighter to my eyes which was probably my single biggest complaint about the 8. You will not want to try and stream a show on a bright day on the beach, but it just looks and performs better overall. Combined now with the bigger screen size and I think this panel might actually be a strength of the new 10. Well done!

-Form Factor: I loved the Fire 8 Plus with one big nitpick: GIGANTIC bezels! This 10 still has big ones but they feel so much smaller to me. Good stuff. The device feels good in the hand. Solid! Amazon claims a twelve-hour battery. I am seeing at least that. This thing is a beast with battery life!! Charging is handled via USBC or wireless. There is an included 9W brick but make sure to find a 15W brick as that is this tablet’s max charging capability. You will see much faster speeds. I have not had to recharge yet but figure around three hours. As with the last gen 8 Plus the wireless charging was a great inclusion at this price Amazon! With 4GB of RAM and a slightly upgraded RealTek processor, I was expecting this to be faster and smoother. Frankly, I am just not sure. Maybe a little bit. It handles everything I have thrown at it. It is a marginal improvement over the last 8 Plus in this regard. If you were hoping for huge speed and performance upgrades over the 8 Plus, do not bother here. It is smoother but it is somewhat negligible. Amazon is claiming almost 2x the durability in drop testing over the latest iPad 10.2 with significantly strengthened glass. Time will tell on that, but this is good news. Additionally, like the 8 Plus, this can be dropped in Amazon’s $50 wireless dock and it will basically become an Echo Show. Pretty slick! I opted for the 64GB model (there is also 32GB) but you can add up to 1TB via expandable memory. Unlike many others, Amazon still supports a good old-fashioned 3.5mm stereo jack. There is a 2MP front-facing camera and a 5MP rear camera that shoots up to 720p video. If you have a smartphone built in the last 4 years, you will want to skip anything but, perhaps, a Zoom meeting. The cameras produce below average images by today’s standards. This is an okay place to make a save in my opinion. The speakers here are improved over the 8 Plus but are still just average.

-Connectivity: You get 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz WiFi here for networking and Bluetooth 5.0 LE. In my experience so far, I have had very stable WiFi connection to my home network with solid range. Additionally, as I would expect with this version of Bluetooth, my connection to my ear buds has been strong and can get 50’ plus of range.

-Other Important Thoughts: I cannot find any codec support from either Amazon or Realtek. I did not anticipate that here. Despite that, I see very little latency when streaming video. Know though that, when streaming music services, do not bother with cranking up the stream quality. This device will not handle anything but fairly compressed audio. Fine in a pinch but an iPhone with AAC or an Android with AptX (at a minimum) will sound better. Amazon does let you go to split screen here to take advantage of the bigger real estate. I do not anticipate using it but you could watch a video on Netflix and answer emails at the same time. Might be handy to some. You will hear grumbling about the Amazon app store in some of the reviews. It happens every time they release a new device. As a long time Fire tablet and Android user, I will say that I have never understood Amazon’s decision here. Just so much work for a substandard result! That said, I doubt too many of you will find many apps missing. Amazon has given us access to all the big-name apps here. There might be some niche missing stuff but 98% of consumers will likely be pleased here. If you are wondering whether to pay for ad removal or not, I always go for the ads. Only on my reading Kindle’s have I paid to remove them. It is not expensive to remove them, but they are only on the lock screen. I swipe the screen and they disappear. Inconsequential to me but, if they bother you, you can pay any time (even after purchase) to remove them so, if you are a first time Fire buyer, I recommend taking the save initially to see how you feel about them. Also, plan on buying the Amazon brand case. It has a premium feel and protects the tablet nicely. It also offers a unique approach to standing the device both in portrait and landscape modes. Well done.

Conclusion:
So, I need to spend more time here and will update as I go but, given the similarities to the 8 Plus, I am confident in my early recommendation. In comparison, I just cannot tell you guys what a difference the size difference makes. Between the smaller bezels and the increased screen size, this feels like a completely different device. The bigger brighter screen just makes consuming all forms of media a much better experience. I did not opt for the “Productivity Package” because, candidly, I just cannot see using this device for work stuff. The point of Fire devices, at least for me, is to just have an inexpensive entertainment machine. Again, I hate to dismiss the idea without trying it but I just do not think a RealTek processor is capable of creating a really robust experience for work and it doesn’t matter how many free Microsoft apps you get thrown into the deal. At just over $200, I am perfectly fine with this. I embrace what Amazon has created here. One other important note: If you have an old Fire device, like the HDX lying around, Amazon gives you 20% off here and $15 for the device, assuming it is still operational. That was a $60 savings for me which is much more than the device was worth. The HD 10 Plus is a well-made high value device that makes entertainment on the fly easy. Whether you want to watch something on Amazon or HBO, do some gaming, fire off some emails, or just surf around the net, this 10.1” Fire tablet will put a smile on your face. I will update this review as I go here but, at least for me, this is an easy recommendation. Nice work to the Amazon team here yet again!

*Update* So it has been over a week and I am more pleased than I was initially. This is exactly what I wanted. The screen is really good. I no longer miss my S21 Ultra when watching video during my elliptical sessions. It is also snappier than I thought initially. Moving around the tablet and interacting with various apps feels more responsive than the last 8 to me for sure. Amazon does include the AAC codec here so Apple users will have optimized audio when listening to music. I finally found that information. All and all, for the price, I continue to be amazed. Will update further but buy with complete confidence.",positive
371,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 Plus tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Slate",$159.99,5,"I purchased this because the iOS version of the Comixology App updated to change the aspect ratios of comics to basically align with the Kindle size format. This in turn shrunk the size of comics on my iPad leaving a lot of empty boarder space, essentially breaking comic viewing for me. The iPad was old and only used for occasional comic reading at this point, so I decided to play right into Amazon's hands and pickup a Kindle Fire to align with the format Amazon was making standard. I've tried reading comics on 7"" and 8"" tablets and it's just too small. So I opted for the 10 and did the ""Plus"" upgrade to get that extra Gig of RAM, along with the wireless charging. The price difference between the 32GB and 64GB was far too great so I went with the 32 and have plenty of old 128GB micro SDs laying around the house to toss in the expandable memory slot if needed.

Initial impressions are the screen is crisp, clear and colorful - great for comic reading. Speed wise I wouldn't call it snappy, but is plenty fast. Definitely faster than my old iPad but glad I opted for the 4GB model. The web browser is pretty slick. I tossed on the YouTube app which works great. The app oddly allows me to change settings to 4K when the video has it available, which causes playback to be choppy. Since this device is only 1920 x 1200, I'm assuming it's due downscaling so I stick with standard HD settings. There are a lot of Amazon apps preinstalled that you cannot remove, so I just tossed them all in a folder aside from the few I wanted to keep. Battery life seems great so far. It’s a very slow drain, though I’m not doing anything taxing on it. The back molding does capture a lot of fingerprints. It smudges a lot, something I’m not used to with other tablets and phones I've owned in the past. A case would solve this issue, but I don't like my reading tablets to be any bulkier than they have to!

Comparing it to my 9 year old iPad Air, I'm surprised that the weights are about the same. The Fire is taller and slimmer and perfectly fits a standard size comic making it display larger than when on my iPad. It is interesting to note that when the comic is a 2 page spread, it does actually display larger on my old iPad because of the wider size when held vertically. It is really nice to be able to purchase comics right from the Kindle Comixology app, something the iOS app hasn't allowed since Amazon acquired Comixology years back. When viewing the screen straight on, the Fire seems brighter and clearer at full brightness than compared to my iPad. However, when moving around or looking over when someone else is holding it, the 9 year old iPad definitely has a wider range of viewing angles.

I did exchange the first Fire I received after a couple of days. Had to speak with someone from Amazon on the phone to do it, as the usual method of requesting an exchange was not available in my account for this product. The first one, while had no functional issues, did this weird thing where the screen and/or back molding would flex and squeak when holding it at certain points. I didn't know if it was a manufacturing defect or was just cheaply made. The replacement unit does not do that at all so I must have received a bad one initially. Maybe it didn’t cure right at the plant? Who knows. One final note for those that aren't familiar with Kindle, I opted for the ""Ads"" version to save a few bucks. The only thing this does is lock out the ability to customize a lock screen and instead presents a forced ad of some kind, usually for a book (in my case). It had not at all seemed intrusive to me and I always have the ability to pay the same upcharge later in settings to unlock this ""feature.""

To sum things up this is a great purchase if you’re looking a comic reader or all around budget tablet. Especially if you can nab it on a sale like I did around Mothers Day! Amazon does heavily discount these from time to time. If you’re debating, just go for it!",positive

I decided on the Amazon Fire HD 10 over both the Echo Show 8 and other more expensive tablets. I watched a few videos on YouTube which helped Me decide on this tablet. It does everything that I need it to do; editing Word documents, music, reading, shopping, browse the internet, etc. I think what I like most of all is the ease of accessibility to all of My Amazon Apps. I find this beneficial as a Prime Member and frequent shopper. This tablet came with Microsoft Office already installed, and it does not require a subscription. I love the battery life, especially when playing music. The split screen option is great also for multi-tasking. The Amazon App store has the bare minimum, but sufficient for what I need. I did not even attemtpt to add the Google Play Store, opting to just enjoy the tablet as is. I did get the recommend keyboard/case and I am satisfied with it as well. It is My preferred keyboard for various tasks, however, if I'm writing an essay(s) over the course of a couple of hours, I use My Logitech MX-3 mouse and MX Keys keyboard for extensive writing. I have not had any Bluetooth issues that I am not familiar with. I have had no connection issues concerning input devices, but sometimes, when I stream music to My stereo via Bluetooth, the signal may become distorted after a few hours, at which point, I simply restart My Fire tablet and keep it moving. I added the recommended screen protector and 256GB MicroSD Card. The camera's are not the best, but I did not buy this for it's picture taking capabilities. I would like to see Amazon put a better front facing camera for video conferencing, but then I would have to say the same for Laptop manufacture's as well. However, My Google Pixel has the photos and videos covered. This is convenient for Me because it is lighter than My laptop, though when attached to the keyboard case, this has a little heft to it too, but not in a bad way. The additional weight keeps the tablet stable and in the upright position when being used. At first glance, it looks like a mini laptop. The tablet and case/keyboard are held together by magnets; no complaints because it very easy and simple to detach and attach the keyboard.

Overall, I have no complaints. This can function as someone main computer or as complementary addition to Your main computer eco system, which is My situation. My Tablet, laptop and phone are all USB-C; life is peachy! No regrets or buyer's remorse here! I gave this system a 5 star rating because it fulfills My needs. I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone on a budget, but wants a very capable tablet.

Update: Wednesday, 08/11/2021.
Earlier I mentioned that this tablet was very capable and that the Amazon App Store was limited; very. As a result, I downloaded and installed the Google Play Store App (GPSA). The process was relatively easy and I did not need the use of an additional computer. This is an Android device at its very core, produced by Google. If You decide to install the GPSA, it is NOT advisable to use it to upgrade any Amazon preinstalled or post-installed apps. This WILL create a conflict, causing Amazon apps to not function at all. Additionally, the tablet will inform You that a default app has been sideloaded. It is better to use the Amazon App Store for all preinstalled and post-installed Amazon apps. Use the GPSA to update only those apps downloaded from Google. The reason why I needed the GPSA was because I have several licenses for Kaspersky Total Protection and did not want to purchase another one through Amazon. I installed it and it works fine. I Am able to go into ""Protected Browser Mode"" on any web browser that I have installed for making credit card purchases. Additionally, I can protect Myself in the event that My tablet is lost or stolen. So hopefully I addressed two things that I had mentioned earlier, capability of this tablet to perform and use other apps, and accessing those apps that you treasure for Your android devices.

I installed Duo and it works fine. Rather than have a bunch of apps all over the home screen(s), I created folders, i.e., Google and Microsoft in particular, and this is where I keep all of those goodies. My default browser and assistance is all Amazon on this device, though I can access others if I chose to. So yes, this tablet is very capable! In closing, I only know about the apps that I have downloaded and cannot speak for those that We may not have in common. The apps that I have downloaded work as they should. And I only installed what I thought I would need to improve My tablet experience. YouTube is a game changer!

I Am NOT encouraging anyone to perform this operation; only that it can be done, if those issues were going to prevent You from purchasing this tablet. For all practical purposes, My Amazon tablet looks just as an Amazon tablet should look; an Amazon tablet. I did not want for this tablet to look identical to other android tablets on the market. My five star rating still remains.",positive

I have owned all of the HD 10 devices released by Amazon. I also own many of the other 7 and 8 inch Amazon devices. With this update, Amazon offers one of the best value in the tablet market. I am a ipad owner as well and feel I am getting 85% of what I can do on my ipad with the HD10 Plus.
I have to say this is if you install the Google Play Store. I know it's not officially looked upon by Amazon or Google by I have one with, and one without the Play Store. Both are very fast and responsive for games, movies and lite office work. I have found it a lot easier to get work done that may not have tried on the 2017 and 2019 models. I think the 4gigs of ram really helps to push this device to it top level. On this device you get true HD on Netflix, Disney,HBO Max and others. You can't say the same for lots of other devices in this price range. The battery life continues to be among the best, I'm getting about 9 to 10 hours.
I like the placement of the camera for video call and the quality is ....OK. Truly nothing to jump and shout about but it will get the job done. Amazon over the years has been great keeping their devices safe and up-to-date which is nice.
I also picked up the made for Amazon case refurbished at a great price as well. This was the best after though purchase I ever made. It turns this tablet into a mini laptop the helps this device punch way above its weight. I now consider it a must have.
So to sum up, great update, great new device if you didn't already have one. Great low price gift for the non tech snob. Not the spec chasing person, just someone looking for a solid low price quality device.",positive

I'm a longtime Android user who, when it comes to tablets, gravitates to flagship devices from the big companies. I actually had my eyes set on the new Lenovo Tab P11 Pro. But my husband managed to convince me to go with the Fire HD largely because, even with the Memorial Day discount of 25% one P11 costs more than two Fire HDs. And there was a lot to like in these tablets: wireless charging and the fancy new keyboard case. And if you aren't going to pay for a family plan, the Office 365 deal is really good.

In your hands, its positive attributes really shine, and the corners they cut are either manageable or sort of charming.

The build quality is quite good, given the materials. You can't use a metal body with wireless charging, so plastic makes sense. Higher end tablets use glass, but I don't mind the plastic here, especially the soft-touch finish on the Plus model. It feels well put-together and sturdy (I recently tried a cheap Windows tablet that was made of similar materials and felt like it would come apart in my hands.)

The processor is old and underpowered, but it feels quite snappy to me. Granted, I'm not much of a mobile gamer, so the most taxing thing I ask it to do is play a podcast or music while I work on a Word document. There is an occasional stutter, but it's hard to know when it's the tablet showing its weakness or an internet bottleneck. The swiftness of the interface is almost certainly the result of the on board 4gb of ram, which give the processor space to maneuver.

The screen resolution is HD, technically, but not very high. I have had older tablets with higher pixel density, and that's a shame. But I'm very impressed with the screen otherwise, and the low density is easy to ignore after some time. But where it really shines is consistency—none of the light bleeding, weird bright spots, or dead or bad pixels that you would expect on a cheap LCD. Indeed, the colors are vivid, and the blacks almost shockingly deep for a non-OLED display. You will certainly find better on a more expensive tablet, but not that much better.

The low pixel density and older CPU, it turns out, give the HD 10 excellent battery life. I charged it last evening and today, after a morning of near constant use, it's only down to 75%. This is with the screen brightness set to a reasonable 50% (I will never understand how people can have it set to full brightness—it's like looking at the sun).

My two biggest gripes are to do with the software.

Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful. Amazon did a great job adapting Android's core to fit their needs and, for the most part, it's perfectly consistent. For the most part, you won't notice that the Android core they're using is based on Android 9, which in a few months will be a full three generations behind with the release of Android 12. It makes sense for Fire OS to lag a bit, but sheesh.

Amazon services really shine here. Kindle books, Audible audio books, Amazon Movies, Amazon Music and, of course, Alexa are all great and modern, as you would expect.

I do find the occasional issue with the operating system or an Amazon app that requires the tablet to switch to portrait mode, for reasons that beggar the imagination. I understand that (super irritating) behavior in third party apps, but you would think Amazon would be able to make their software work better for their own device. Why must it switch to portrait mode to change the wallpaper, of all things? Or the Fire TV app only work in portrait like it's a phone?

It must come as no surprise that third party apps is by far the weakest part of the Kindle Fire experience.

When Amazon first released its Appstore it did so with the ethos that it would be known for quality over quantity, and their app catalog seemed to have almost all the apps I used regularly on my phone. I haven't used the Appstore until getting this tablet so I'm kind of shocked at the state of things.

If you read a review of any Amazon device you will almost certainly read about the paucity of apps available. But what no one seems to mention is the decline in quality, and just how out of date everything is. It feels like walking around a store in a mall as it's going out of business. The apps that are available are sometimes *years* behind their Google Play equivalents. It seems the developers added their app to Amazon's Appstore then just abandoned it.

I guess I get it. Google's Play Services provide a lot of great tools for developers and it's probably irritating to try to develop two different versions of the same Android app (to say nothing of then developing for iOS). My concern is that the Appstore will continue to atrophy, and even newer apps will fade away. Microsoft recently added their Office apps, and that's great, but I can already see them falling behind. Moreover, for reasons that I can't understand, they didn't include everything: no Microsoft To Do app (as a side note, it works great if you sideload it).

This evaluation is just of the apps that are okay from reputable developers. There is now a LOT of app detritus: terrible, poorly made, amateurish apps, the kind that Google and Apple seemed to allow just so they could brag about how many apps they had in their respective stores.

What happened to the Appstore?? Amazon, one of the wealthiest companies in the world, can, and should, do better.

I suppose the bottom line is hardware is good; Amazon apps are great; the state of third party apps are alarming. But it's a great tablet that is well worth the money.",positive

But then as the technology improved, along with security, lots of apps were no longer available or supported, then the battery life started getting weird and it would ""die"" after a couple of days in Standby.
For this new 10+, I LOVE that they gave you the option for 64GB internal storage, but also a MicroSDXC slot, that DOES SUPPORT at least 512GB, and they say 1TB, but I'm not splurging for that just yet.
Regarding the MicroSDXC slot - YES, you do get errors that the card needs to be reseated, BUT THAT ONLY OCCURS AFTER A REBOOT, and if you can be patient, once the OS fully loads, the error messages go away - but that is something Amazon support should be looking at........... you know, maybe stagger how the OS boots so the MicroSDXC drivers fully load BEFORE reporting on them.

I am NOT a huge fan of the lack of apps on the Amazon app store for the Fire tab. Thankfully, with some searching, I was able to find some alternatives. I have a smartphone with apps I like, but the phone screen is so small. I mostly solved that with APKextractor (Research it, it's pretty good) on my smartphone. Then I found APKpure to install on the Fire 10+, which acts like an alternative ""Google Play Store"", you just search for apps, and it also updates the apps you install from it.

All in all, not exactly a perfect solution, but as of now, there is only ONE app that I'm unable to install on the Fire 10+, and it's a banking app, so I can use the Silk browser that's included with the Fire 10+, or use one of the other browsers I was able to install using APKpure (Brave and Opera; decided not to go with Chrome)

I have not played around with taking pictures or video just yet, although I have checked out Youtube and some other sites with video and the screen quality is just amazing, along with literally no buffering/delay when playing videos.

Social media apps on the Fire 10+.............. meh, I don't do FB/Twtr/IG and I try to avoid anything yahoo, but I was able to get Telegram installed successfully and it works! I might try Gettr next, and if they ever do come out with the Android version of TS, I'll have to try that as well.

So in closing, I'm pretty impressed with the Fire 10+ with its speed, versatility, and storage options, and only wish Amazon didn't make it so difficult to work with other apps.",positive
376,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 Plus tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Slate",$159.99,4,"First things first. to all the people worried about how a slightly smaller tablet is going to affect your 10"" display. just stop. its not going to. The displays are measured diagonally like all displays ever. the size of the tablet over all is not having an effect on this. The screen real-estate is still 10"" just like the 2019 model. What has been shrunk is the dead zones of the tablet along the edges. My pictures should show that :)

Now to the review.

Comparing to the Kindle FIre HD 10 (2019) BLUE vs the new Kindle fire HD 10 + (black)

Over all. the upgrade is very noticeable right from the first boot up.

Display: 10/10

The display itself. is so sharp, and so vibrant the comparison was night and day. The 2019 Fire tablet was good but its colors were more muted and over all more dull. when side by side with the new one. its a no brainer. the colors were more vibrant and it was like someone turned saturation up in the perfect way. the colors were just so dang good. and the picture was incredibly sharper. They nailed the display perfectly. this is the kind of quality i like to see in upgrades hands down.

Camera 6/10

What can i say. it works? the camera isn't as crappy as the 2019 model. maybe a little better but not noticeably. but i don't by the tablet for the camera. i buy it for other functionality. i have my phone or my canon for a camera if i really need a good picture. plus amazon has never had great camera's.

Sound 9/10

My biggest complaint about the 2019 models were the speakers. Don't get me wrong they were great speakers but the lowest volume on the 2019 kindles were still very loud. dear god. i couldn't watch netflix or anything in bed because i was worried id wake up the wife. But these new speakers, they nailed it. the sound is super clear, and the lowest volume is actually LOW again HECK YA! i love it. another upgrade nailed.

Speed 9/10

The speed, the loading all of it is great. I've not had something as close to the speed of the HDX in so long. i missed that kindle for so long. and this, this tablet is equal to or better than the HDX in terms of processing speed. Compared to the 2019 model directly this one is also a bit faster. it doesn't have this hanging lag time on apps that the 2019 model's had. nor does it take forever to load something just for it stall out.

Picture in picture and split screen.

ok. i was thinking split screen was going to be buggy as all heck but man i was surprised. I spend a lot of time on messenger apps, telegram, facebook,discord, etc. its not horrible to have picture in picture but for those of us with crappy eye sight it can be frustrating as heck to watch a movie on a tiny screen while your working on something else. Or to be surfing the web or opening a app while you have P.I.P. on and a pop up to just pop up and say. "" Something else needs this. you will have to close your video to continue"" or w/e it says.

Split screen however doesn't work like this. It is immensely better.

Now before you ask, NOT EVERY app supports it. i tried it with disney+ and youtube last night. Netflix i know currently doesn't support this. To find it. hit the little Square button on your 3 little buttons at the bottom of your screen. tab the app icon in the top center of your screen for a drop down and you will see ""App info"" and if it supports it. ""Split screen"" if it does not support split screen yet it wont be there. This isn't something amazon has in its power. its up to the app developers. NOT AMAZON.

Now. once you tap split screen on that menu it will snap that app to the left side of your screen and like in windows 10 it minimizes all these other windows that you can snap to the right. select one. and do what you want. Between both splits is a solid black border that you can long press on and drag to the left or to the right to make one window more big to the other. giving it more real estate on your screen. This can be done any time. Last night i did this with Disney plus while i was talking to friends on Telegram (which i side loaded, just look up Telegram APK in bing or google. WARNING: amazon won't trouble shoot aps you install this way as technically they're not supported by the devs on the amazon market place)

Anyway. it was really nice to have my primary window open to have disney running while chatting with friends.

Another thing i tested was checking to see if i could play 2 video apps at the same time. so i loaded Disney and Youtube. Fun fact: you can have both split screen. BUT it pauses the video opposite to the one you just hit play on. lol.

Overall. SPLITSCREEN is a god tier feature that i love and use a lot now. I've not noticed any hit to performance other than it does tax the battery more but that's expected.

Overall the only thing holding this tablet back is that the camera isn't the best. but ill take that if i get all this other power and feature. definitely a worthy upgrade. if you are considering upgrading from the 2019 model. DO it. its worth it. I will say the buttons and the camera's are in different locations on this new one as opposed to the 2019 models so you will need a new case to fit it. but i mean. thats just another reason to update the look in my books lol. i like getting new things. and this is one of my favorites. so much that i had to post a review. I hope this helps anyone that is reading it.",positive

I mainly use this tablet for content consumption, a device I have lying around the house, and for throwing in my work bag. So far so good! I don’t use it for “long loading” websites or heavy apps, or things like opening multiple tabs at once. It’s not great for that. It will if you’re willing to wait long enough though. I have an iPad and other computers around the house that I use for that stuff.

I enjoy amazon tablets more than I do other android tablets because I am HEAVILY in their eco system. I love amazon. I am an amazon w’h0re! And the real reason I chose this over another android tablet is because of how seamless it works with their services. Amazon shopping, prime videos, kindle unlimited, novella, games etc. And I can still access the google play store for other apps that aren’t listed.

I love that I can read my ebooks on this. I have a kindle ereader as my main book reading, but for those nights at work where it’s really slow I love the ease of downloading my library onto this device. It’s as simple choosing the book and waiting for it to load. And it syncs automatically.

All of my children also have the kids version of this tablet. I can’t say enough how user friendly this tablet is. I have the parental controls set so that each device is filtered by their ages. I can also add or remove single content that I feel fits. The parental control dashboard is online so I can change it up literally from any device. My kids can do voice call, video call, chat with each other. I much prefer this over an iPad for my kids. Amazon makes it so easy to control what they can see online.

The play store. Which you’d have to google-was a fairly easy thing for me to do. There’s just some things in the play store that I like which amazon doesn’t offer. YouTube for example literally has no lag. It works better on this than my iPad, because it can continue playing while it is shrinked, if you get out of the app. On iOS, you can’t do that with the YouTube app itself.

To summarize my experience. The amazon fire hd 10 has been perfect for my family and I. The cost of the tablet is more than fair, it’s a steal! Compared to how it performs, it is wonderful. You won’t feel guilty splurging on it because it’s on the frugal end. If you destroy it or it malfunctions amazon’s customer service is usually really awesome. You can drop it and won’t feel like you just broke it because it’s made of durable plastic. If you’re still contemplating getting it, know that this is a wonderful content consumption device. It can multitask fairly well but don’t expect ipad results on a $200 device.",positive
378,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 Plus tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Slate",$159.99,3,"Sorry about the following novel.

From the start, I had problems with random shutoffs. After a little forum dive, I tested the theory that the small magnetic closure on the case i purchased was interfering somehow. I blocked the magnet from reaching the ""innards"" by taping sheet metal (furnace ducting) to a piece of cardboard. This solved the problem for 6 weeks. Then the random shutoffs restarted. Literally right in the middle of doing something, and with 68% charged battery. It would make a loud single clicking sound before shutting off.

I was getting ready to call tech support quite literally on Monday, the day after that seemingly ominous click shutoff, to generally discuss his problem. The next morning, on a fully charged battery, it shut off again for NO REASON. I called Tuesday.
I began the trouble shooting process, resets, charging, and even a hard reset. Nothing worked; the screen stayed black. Naturally I was not happy. I have had this unit only 2 months. So, I bit the bullet and called tech support.

A related aside: I bought the 10+ when my HD8 refused to keep a charge or charge fully. The mini usb charger port was not functioning well, battery drain, etc. I ordered a new battery for the 8, so I could pass it own to my hubby, then ordered the 10+. (Thanks to my son for my Christmas gift)

There was a good deal on the 10+, bundled with a keyboard and a free year of Microsoft Office suite. I loved the idea of not hauling out my clunky 17in laptop that's SLOW. (This Fire is the one that randomly shut down and refused to wake up. )

The other glitch? In activating the new tablet, it asks if you want to transfer progress and files from previous Kindle. This thing only gave me the 8 as an option from which to update. The 10+ was not an option. I chose not to update from there. So I called tech support again to find out why I couldn't update from the first 10+, and ask how to update from the 8 if it was my only option. They told me that it was likely because I had not opted to backup the first 10+ to the cloud. That's flat-out impossible. The default settings have that box checked, as well something about scanning networks. I would NEVER have shut those off. I've had so many Kindle devices exchanged over the years. On the second question, how to update from 8, I did not get an answer. The agent put me on hold a couple times, offered a $30 credit for my troubles, and our call was disconnected in the middle of a conversation. She did NOT call me back as they are supposed to do. I did receive the cedit.

Furthermore, before I got on the phone with her, my Fire 8, with a fresh battery and working great, was at 98% charge immediately. After a few hours use, I put my charger on it because it was under 70%. It did not recognize my aftermarket charger, so I plugged in the original charger. It did not appear to recognize that either. Put it on Qi, same. Then it shut off, completely, like the 10+ did a few days ago. Will not turn on, period. All the same troubleshooting was done, no result. I was done at that point, enough tech blah blah for me. I live to fight another day! Tomorrow.

On a positive note, they sent me a new 10+ immediately, and it's working well. I have not introduced the magnetic case to it. Instead I've had it hooked up to the keyboard case that came with the bundle. That has magnetic attachment, but causes no trouble. Color me baffled.
A word about the keyboard interface. Love! I have to activate my free year of Microsoft Office and play with that. The Fire is way less clunky than my laptop, which does NOT have Office on it. I'm sure I will use it more.
My IT computer geek hubby decided to do more research, and the only thing he found that I had not done was to put the devices on charger for 24 hours, then try again to boot up. I am NOT optimistic, but they have been on chargers since 1pm.

Tomorrow I call tech again at 1:05pm and see what to do about 10+ retrieval and my 8+ that died. The 8 is obviously well out of warranty. You'd think a long-time Kindle customer and, frankly, huge Amazon shopper, would be given their best efforts. I've said it a million times; ol Bezos and minions are fantastic with customer service in general. But blaming the customer for a glitch is beneath them. There is NO way I shut off the cloud backup from it's default ""on"" position on the 10+. Not remotely possible. And I lost HUGE game progress going from 8 to 10. IF I can start up the 8, I can back it up into the cloud for Best Fiends. Same for 10, but that's Candy Crush. I learned from Fiends that I needed to back it up, and i did, but it still didn't transfer everything.

Hopefully it gets resolved tomorrow. I'm out the cost of a magnetic case ($26), innumerable glass screen protectors from returning literally EVERY Kindle at least once (at least 5 screen covers, conservatively $30 there). I've had to purchase replacements for both the case and glass screen protectors that cost more right now than they did when I bought them. (Total $50)

But, even with the aggravation, I love my Kindles for ease of use, low cost, and superior customer service. I have faith that Amazon will come through, it's just a matter of persistence. I have an overload of that. LOL",fair
379,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 Plus tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Slate",$159.99,4,"I had an RCA TAblet I bought from Walmart at least 8 years ago. I didn't know at the time it could NEVER be updated. I got 8 years out of it but when I wanted to use it for Hulu, I couldn't even download it to the tablet. I found another tablet on Amazon some name that began with n R or an O maybe. Chinese brand. It was ok but the speakers were TERRIBLE. I needed my Anker bluetooth speaker 100% of the time. The speakers on the RCA TAblet were better! I paid around 120 for the Chinese one. I planned on sending it back asap. Then Prime day happened and just for the heck of it I looked and there it was: A fire HD 10.1 quad core 32gb for less than I paid for the Chinese one. After a bit of reading I bought it then promptly requested for a return for the other one.
I received the Fire in two days and I was INSTANTLY blown away! I totally lucked out with the Prime Day deal I am so happy! (Good things come to those who wait it's said and I think ""waiting"" 8 years with the RCA led me to get this tablet).
The screen resolution is out of this world. I've never had a tablet look so crisp and clean.
The sound is ASTOUNDING... no external speakers needed.
I only use this tablet for a bedside tv.. for Hulu, netflix, prime video, youtube. etc. and a few games. I might read on it but I have a paperwhite and I get distracted easily.
Because it's not loaded with apps the battery life is awesome. I can watch video for upwards of 10 hours before a charge. However, I cannot charge and watch at the same time because it uses more power to watch a video than it has coming in when charging. So don't let the battery get too low if you're watching video.
Charging from 0-100 takes quite a few hours. Prob. 6-8 but that's a good thing.. it means it's a strong battery. (my iphone 6s battery is at 75% health and dies in 30 min. of constant use but also charges in 3o minutes).
The ONLY thing I don't like is the app store. I feel it is lacking and the apps that are available aren't the same as android or ios apps. Youtube for example. (which I use every day as I sub to many channels). It is cumbersome and is missing main features that Android and ios has. Live chat during live streams for one. Absolutely no option for that. It took me a while to learn how to navigate the yt app as well. getting from watching a video back to the previous page. There are no yt app controls for that. you must use the tablet on screen buttons for that. I'm thinking this is a third party yt app because it seems to be the only Google app in the app store. There is no Google maps, Chrome, Photos, etc. That's a big pain for me as I use them all. I would get much more use out of the tablet if these were an option because I use them all.
There is also other apps that are missing that I use regularly: Broadcastify, Flightradar24, Police scanner app., a note pad. Those are just off the top of my head.
Because all those apps are missing it further ensures this will only be a bedside and travel tv. (I took it with me on a road trip to Florida from NY and I got to watch all my shows that I recorded on Hulu. Tv Anywhere is an awesome option. I never even turned on the hotel tv's or the tv's at the Air BB I stayed at in Florida).

Oh, one more thing that it annoying . The volume control. In order to mute you have to first press a manual button to display the on screen volume, then tap the mute option, or just hold down the volume down. What is further annoying.. if you do have it muted from say a 50% level, the only way to unmute is to press and hold the volume up to raise the volume. Muting actually makes the volume 0.. it doesn't mute it from the setting you had it at. You always have to raise the volume to unmute. There should be a mannual mute button along with the volume and power.

The few cons that I posted is what dropped this to a 4 star but everything else about this is awesome.

For the case I bought a $5 case from Five and Below. I don't take it out of the house often so I didn't need a $40 case.

All in all, I would buy this again because the pros outweigh the few cons, at least what I wanted to use it for. If you want to use this for apps, just know because this tablet is NOT android based there are NO google apps.",positive

I don't know how the performance compare to others Chromebook, for me is just enough to open about 7 tabs with 1 youtube video playing, in this situation it is slow to move cursor and click the items on page. If you try to playback the 720p60fps or 1080p YouTube, I don't think the processor is good enough to play it as it is lag it you try to do other command, if you try to adjust the video playback speed, it will lag after a few seconds and the video and audio is not synchronized.
If you want to keep the performance just below the limit of this laptop, you can only open 5 tabs on the same time with 1 youtube video 720p or lower quality.
The startup time is 2-3 second, but there will be 2 seconds wait for the chrome load up a page. There will be 5-10second of opening a Google sheet. The Google map is not smooth to use on this laptop, lag to zoom in/out.
For hardware, it is a 1080p mon, 2x usb-c(only 1 can charging), 2x usb-A, 3.5mm mic/headphone, a micro-sd slot. 32GB storage, 11GB for android, 2.5 for chromeOS, 18.5GB rom only.
For me is good enough for light use such as web surface, using Google doc, sheet to do some travel research, the shortcut is also very good, fast to open/close/switch page. But I cannot use it for daily, I only use when I am lazy to turn on the desktop/ not using for a long time/ take it out for discussion.
If you are using a middle range hardware(say i5-4430) computer for a long time, I don't think Lenovo 14e Chromebook can reach your standard of a computer, maybe you can try m3 core or even i3 core Chromebook, it should be fast enough for chrome os as it is a light os compare to window 10. Using this laptop spec for window 10 will be much worst than chrome os. For me, if buying a new Chromebook few years later should buy a i3 core CPU to make sure the performance, as I need is speed and fast enough to open 10 or more tabs and playback 1080p with 2x speed with no lag.
To conclude,
Pro:
light use
maximum 6-7 tabs in the same time is ok
Cheap
Premium outlook
1080p 14"" mon
Can load android apps but slow
Con:
Slow compare to mid range desktop.
Small storage, 18.5GB only

Used, refurbs, outlet deals...I looked everywhere for a halfway decent sub-$300 laptop that ticked all my boxes; lightweight, powerful enough to handle basic tasks (web browsing, emailing, office functions), at least somewhat ""future proof"", and not completely devoid of basic external connection capabilities. Nothing in the Windows OS world really offered everything I needed.

I wound up narrowing my choices down to Chromebooks. This little Chromebook is, so far, perfect for me. It's not prohibitively expensive, but it's also no horribly cheaply made. I've owned a couple of cheap Chromebooks, and while they were plenty functional, they felt like toys. The build quality of this Chromebook is top notch. It's super speedy, boots up in an instant (as most Chromebooks do), and has all the basic functionality I need. The two USB ports are a huge plus, as is the availability of a Bluetooth connection. The screen quality is excellent. The display is bright and vibrant. So much so that I had to turn it down to 60%. Sound quality is lacking, but that's not really relevant, as no one's buying a Chromebook because they need exceptional sound quality. I'm not too fond of the trackpad. I can't quite find a mouse speed setting that moves the cursor just the way I like. It's not a big deal, though. It's more of a personal preference issue, and I use my external Bluetooth mouse most of the time.

I own the the original 8 HD, the next generation, and now the latest. Obviously if you love the Amazon environment as I do, you can't go wrong with this tablet. I never ventured into the Apple world simply because I couldn't afford it on a teacher's salary and because I was already invested in Prime.

All of my tablets continue to function without any issues. The 8HD is beginning to show its age because the operation system can't update to the latest and greatest due to hardware issues. But it still will be grabbed for reading and listening to music.

Durable. That is what I would call these tablets. If I was going to use the tablets for other than recreational use, I would be looking for.something else. But as it is, the tablets do what I want them to do at a price point that keeps.me happy.

There are a couple.of issues that have been consistent across the three versions I own. The first is that the battery life has been ,""meh, "". All models promoted themselves as having really decent battery life. That was true when new. All three seemed to begin losing battery life within the first 6-10 months of usage. I am very careful with my charging protocol, making sure I don't just leave them on charge overnight like some people do.

Nowever, with three tablets, I always have one fully charged and ready to go.

The second issue I have with the Amazon tablets is the placement of the volume and power buttons. You would think Amazon could afford some decent investigation into now people.actually handle the tablet when using it. This latest version has been the absolute most annoying. When holding it in my hands, I frequently find I've accidentally changed the volume or turned the tablet off. The 8HD's buttons were recessed enough I never had this problem. But the later versions of the tablet all have the buttons sticking out farther from the case making them easier to locate but also.easier to accidently hit. And, whoever thought the on/off button should be directly under the volume button should never be allowed in a product design studio again.

A minor complaint is the spellchecker. Absolutely the worst I've ever seen. If you don't mind random periods and single words changed into two that don't make sense, like 'because' being change into 'be wise' (Huh?), then this probably won't bother you. Also if your high school English teacher drilled poofreading into your mindset, you should find this spellchecker subroutine an extension of heaven!

Figured it wise to disclose this up front. I’m not adept at all android os devices yet, but learning on the fire tablet has been decently intuitive and relatively easy. For the past 8 years, I’ve used an Apple iPad Air 2013 model that I got refurbished in 2014. It was always a crisp screen view and has held up since I bought the one with the most memory available. This Spring (2022), I noticed that more and more apps were not opening because the outdated OS no longer supported those apps. I kept using the iPad since streaming services were still working. That ended in June 2022–suddenly several of the streaming apps I regularly used stopped opening. I really didn’t want to spend upwards of $1,000 on a new or recently used iPad, so I looked into this recent model Fire tablet. This has been a good alternative so far! The screen resolution while streaming is good. The Home Screen resolution isn’t nearly as crisp as my old iPad was, but I got this Fire tablet on Prime Day for well under $100 (so freaking solid quality nonetheless given how much money I saved). Setting the Fire up was pretty easy, and I’ve been using the kindle feature on it far more than I ever used on my iPhone. I liked how the screen can be personalized, and have generally enjoyed this Fire for the few weeks I had it so far. The only real pain in the @$$ though is despite extending the screen sleep timer to 10+ minutes this thing routinely auto dims or sends its screen into sleep mode frequently while I am actively using it! It’s really annoying, because I can’t just hit a home button to awaken it—I typically have to close the magnetic cover & reopen it. I’m getting used to the exercise, but it’s sure noisome! Maybe this a user error issue?! I’m a bit ignorant on this point and my lack of experience with Fire tablets must be acknowledged. That said, it’s why I knocked off a star. I’ll try to update this review in the future once I’ve better familiarized myself with the OS and researched some online troubleshooting remedy discussions.",positive

Anyway, the replacement did away with the keyboard, and installed an infuriating pop-up version on which I am forever making typos.This was presumably to increase the screen size. More importantly, they removed the earphone jack. As I spent a fair amount of time listening to the electronic voice reading, while did something else....big issue.

Now we come to my decision to upgrade my smaller Fire tablet to a bigger screen. Being that I put thing off at a Professional level, my wife ended up getting me this as an early birthday present. I encountered yet another 'dump': I can only listen to a book if I own the Audible version. Which means, in essence, about 20 titles, most of which are books I wrote and released through ACX. Since you would literally have to beat me into submission to abandon a ton of better books to listen those...well, you get the general idea. I have probably 900 books that I can't audible skim through while working crosswords or balancing the national debt. So, okay, that latter bit is just an excuse I give my wife, and I suspect she's starting to catch onto the fact.

ANYWHOO...

I'm keeping the smaller Fire to essentially replace my Kindle, but this is a HUGE omission for me. Would it have taken up that much memory to leave the auto-read feature in place?????????

She doesn't like reading on tablets, so I am using it. The screen is easy to see and read on even with cataracts. It's not an iPad, and hopefully it's not made with slave labor, like the iPod. It does everything I want and does it well, so I am very pleased with it. It's much faster than the previous version. I know because I went back to it after finishing a book on my new one and the load time of a book that was already downloaded to it was about the same as the wait to download and open a book on the new. Watching video is a pleasure, the color depth is excellent and the CPU on this version is fast enough that the WIFI is the limiting factor on how video is displayed. we watched ""Tombstone"" on the laptop and there was no buffering.

I primarily use tablets for streaming purposes, audio and video. This device does both very well.
My primary apps:
iHeart Radio
Peacock
ESPN
xfinity Stream (companion app for Cable TV)
Amazon Prime
Amazon Prime Music
Spotify

All of those apps work well. Video quality is equal to an iPad (yes I also have one of those).
iHeart Radio has a problem with streaming one particular radio station on this tablet, but I suspect it is not primarily a Fire problem.

I typically use bluetooth headphones, but the built-in speakers work well when I need them.

Battery life is multiple days for me. I typically run the battery down to 10% then charge up to 90%. (it helps having another tablet available)

Of note -- fast charging via USB-C works fine with this tablet.

Of note 2 -- no YouTube app, but! You can download an 'app' (on-screen button) that just opens youtube.com, which works just fine.

Occasional minor problems with touching the right spot on the screen for some menu options -- but I suspect my fat fingers are the problem more than the device.",positive

That was unacceptable to me, considering the cost of ipad and that it was only 2 years old and being made obsolete by apple, so I tried my first kindle fire. My first one was an 8 in version. I found that it was able to do all I wanted and more. After having it for a period, I gave it to a friend and then bought my first 10 in hd Fire tablet. For my work, I was able to become 100% paperless with the use of the tablet and my computer. I recently bought my third, again a Fire HD 10 now the 11th generation, and again, I love it.

We have Direct TV Stream and couldn't get it through the Amazon app store but that is the only one I found so far. What I do like is Alexa, iPads do not have that, we hook the Fire Tablet to a Bluetooth speaker and pass the tablet around and people can just ask Alexa to play what they want on Spotify. No one has to press buttons, just talk to the tablet. And if something happens to the tablet we aren't out a lot of $$. So far they have taken a lot of falls and the tablets have held up well.

397,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Denim",$129.99,4,"All in all, I am satisfied. Initially, I wanted only a reader, but found out the Kindle readers' memories are not expandable; the tablets are with a separately bought card. Having an e-library of over 7200 books & documents, I wanted a unit where as many items as possible could be downloaded & then accessed without wifi; as best as I can tell, this is doable. What I find most aggravating is the over riding Alexa, as well as some other settings like notifications. No matter how many times I check every possible setting for each app, Fire 10 (2021) repeatedly over rides. I don't use it for playing games, watching movies, or listening to music. I don't access any email or social media accounts, not even a calendar. As I said, I really only wanted a unit that could hold a lot of downloaded reading materials. There isn't the option to uninstall useless apps & the disable buttons are nonfunctional; the only viable option is to force stop. In the month of ownership, I've had to stop all of the Alexa apps & all notifications more than 4 times! I am unimpressed with its battery life. In a typical usage of 2 & 1/2 hours, the battery reduces 25%. The touch screen is not as sensitive to finger touch as it is to a stylus. I bought the Fire 10 on a Prime Day & am very glad about the $95 discount. Had I gotten it at full price, I doubt I would've put up with all of its aggravations.",positive

When this new model 10 inch Fire Tablet was reduced in price during the holidays in 2021, I decided it was time to make the jump to a larger screen (more (paper) book sized) and gain more battery ife per charge due to a larger battery.

This 10 incher did not disappoint at all. As a primary use for Kindle books, I'm getting 20 or more % battery life then the 12 hours the specs suggest this tablet can get.

The screen quality for reading is perfect. I typically set it to lower brightness (fixed) and there's no glare in the eyes nor any eye strain when using in a darkened bedroom at night.

The faster processor then my older 8 inch HD clearly adds some speed to anything you do on this tablet.

There's no lag at all in trying it for video, gaming, etc. As stated though, for me, I use a Fire Tablet primarily as a reader, period.

Screen resolution and contrast is excellent, certainly not any better ( and a little less) than my iPad PRO, but, of course we're talking a big difference in cost between tablets here and very different display technologies as well.

That said, this 10 inch HD Tablet is no slouch in offering a clear, sharp/detailed display with very sufficient color saturation and accuracy plus nice crisp text over-all.

Given Amazon offers just about any app needed for this fire Tablet, it certainly could be used for just about everything that an iPad could be and at a competitive price to the new basic model iPad model that sells in the $330+ dollar range now.

Some reviewers said due to where the camera is (oddly) located, one must use this Fire tablet in a case with the cover opening to the right rather then to the conventional left, but, not true. Since this tablet can flip screen orientation based on where the top of screen is located, I'm using a hard shell case for my Fire and the conventional left cover opening as normal. Granted the camera is at the bottom left corner in my configuration, but, that is no issue since if one needs to use the camera, they can orient the tablet however they wish and the screen (and camera) will orient as needed for photos.

The net here is you can use the tablet in a case and flip open the left cover as normal.

As an owner of both an iPad Mini and an iPad Pro 11 inch, I can say in all honesty, anyone wanting a tablet on a budget and hoping to get some decent performance and screen quality plus great battery life won't be disappointed at all in this new model 10 inch Fire Tablet.

I got the base 32 GB version with ads. Ads only show on the screen saver when opening up the sleep/wake cover and a one finger flip up of the screen goes back to where you left off or the home screen. Ads really are not a biggie in this context at all.

Given one can add a micro SD card to gain more storage space, and Micro SD cards are dirt cheap now, the 32GB version is fine for me.

No complaints at all and 5 stars all around for this Fire Tablet. A well designed tablet at a very good price.

I highly recommend it! If you order one, it'll be a definite ""keeper"".",positive
399,Computers & Accessories,"Fire HD 10 tablet, 10.1"", 1080p Full HD, 32 GB, latest model (2021 release), Denim",$129.99,5,"Just before Christmas in 2021, this item popped up on sale for just $75. We’re an apple family. We have numerous iPads in the house, plus our iPhones, Mac, MacBooks, Apple TV, etc. I’m an audio mixer, and use a product from Avid called the S1. It’s a control surface for Pro Tools that is meant to house a tablet for additional functionality- or eye candy. My older IPad worked, but looked tiny in the cradle, and wasn’t all that useable. I wanted something bigger, but didn’t want to spend the money on yet another iPad. For $75, I was willing to roll the dice.

It fits great, looks great, and does exactly what I bought it for.

But then I started to explore it deeper. It has built in Alexa with the wake word Amazon. As an audio engineer working from home, I sporadically have actors coming to record. I’ve got Ring doorbells at the entrances, and Echo devices in nearly every room. But for the first time, I can say “Amazon, show me the front door!”, and actually SEE it- and a lot faster than the Ring app on my phone would allow. This was a nice bonus. In fact, in my experience and opinion, Alexa works for much quicker and more reliably than Siri, that I’ve found myself relying on it a lot more. Having Alexa in the tablet to verbalize reminders, appointments, phone calls, etc- all right in front of me, is amazing!

I became fascinated with my new toy, and downloaded all the steaming media we subscribe to, plus other apps for news and weather that provide lots of content. I quickly found that I enjoyed watching tv on a 10 inch screen a lot more than on my iPhone. It’s nice to have lunch at the table with my kiddo and share a video we can both easily see and hear. So- this little guy has a great screen and works perfectly for watching shows, movies, YouTube, news, etc.

Now- I love my iPhone, and have my music library in iTunes. But when I purchase music, it’s always via Amazon. This is because I get my MP3 files instantly for most albums- but then have a physical disc arrive that often goes unopened. I just like know that HAVE the disc if I ever need to load it again or want to enjoy it in my stereo system. My iPhone can store a decent amount of music internally for when streaming isn’t an option. But I was floored to learn that the HD10 2021 has a micro SD card slot that can store up to 1 TB!!! That’s amazing to me. I can preload entire series, movies, music, photos- anything I need for a long trip or chilling in downtime. For like $25 I added a 400 gig card. Why iPads don’t have this is beyond me.

I work with and coach voice actors outside of my day job as a recording engineer. Having that much memory on a tablet and access to an app like WavePad, gives them the ability to record in a pinch while away from their studios. On-screen editing is also fun and easy. I actually added a nifty stylus and case to my HD10, along with a Bluetooth keyboard. It’s essentially a mobile studio, albeit limited.

While I haven’t experimented a ton with this- Silk browser (which seems to run on Chrome) allows me to use Source Connect Now to tap into actors or listen to sessions remotely at “CD quality”. Of course you can also use Zoom, Skype, etc.

As an apple user, I still want access to my ICloud apps, like Contacts, calendar, Pages, Keynote, Numbers, etc. You can log into your iCloud account and get it all. The trick is to choose “request desktop site”, otherwise you dead-end at “find my device”. You can even log into Apple Music via the browser. So all my apple stuff is still with me!

I chose Outlook email to run my various work and personal emails and have a unified calendar. It’s perfect for what I need.

For $75, I’m finding myself using it more than I have ever used my iPad. It’s the right screen size for me to actually be productive with it, while also having endless entertainment in reach. Add a case, keyboard and stylus- and you’re good to go!",positive
400,Computers & Accessories,Amazon eero mesh WiFi system – router replacement for whole-home coverage (3-pack),$169.00,1,"Good day,

I am testing & reviewing more than 50 different brand of routers ( stand alone & mesh) for years, and I can tell y'all that IF you have maximum of 1500 Sq ft of house/apartment, that's newly built & no basement, just get a stand alone tri-band router, that has 4-5 stars review.

If your place is more than 1500 sq ft. with basement, old, lots of hard walls, etc... then get a MESH router that is:

* Tri-band (NOT Dual-band), why? So you will get the speed you're paying for, every month
* A router & satellite that has 6 or more antenna, as it will not just cover more, but it can see you 360 degrees
* WiFi 5 or Wifi 6 (especially IF you have more than 25 devices connected, all the time)
* Have a history of updating the software 5-6 times a year
* Giving a free security suite, not for just a one month, but for a year or forever

And ALL those important things I just said, this router doesn't have!

DO NOT LISTEN to people will say, it's OK for those who have lower than 200Mbps connection, WRONG! Why? Because that 200Mbps is only when you're hardwired, but when you connect ANY of your devices to this EERO, the speed you will get is only half of that OR most of the time, even you're near the router/satellite, you will only get 1/4 of 200Mbps.

I tested ALL known Tri Band Mesh Router, and they are much faster than ANY Dual Band Mesh router, any day.

So, when you are paying for 200Mbps internet speed, and you're using like a Netgear ORBI RBK53, that speed will be almost in every corners of your place, even outside (front and back patio).

ALL these manufacturers CAN give us those 5 points I just said between $200 - 300 (for 3 pcs.), but they just don't like to, as I've seen SALE prices of Netgear Orbi RBK53 (3 pcs.) for just $300.

We should NOT buy those DUAL BAND MESH ROUTER, so they will change it to a much better hardware and software and NOT charge us for a obsolete technology, an arm and a leg.

I have now the Amazon made EERO, and I'm paying for Spectrum Gig speed, and the fastest I can get is 400Mbps (LITERALLY NEAR the Main router), but with Deco M9, Orbi, Zyxel, etc... Tri Band Mesh Router & ALL stand alone Tri Band routers, I can reach 700-800Mbps in the same location & devices.

And y'all will say, those are expensives, NOT REALLY, as I've seen Deco M9 with 3 pcs. for only $230 at Costco, etc... and many others brand that can give you a much faster speed and wider coverage, between $250 - $350.

Again, DO NOT BELIEVE on the LIES of those will say, dual band MESH router is OK, bla bla bla...

I personally showed to people the difference (when I uninstalled/installed the Amazon EERO vs Netgear ORBI using NOTE 10 Plus, iPad Pro 11 & Surface Book 2) of the speedtest results, for almost the same price, but the ORBI can reach 800Mbps & EERO with only 400Mbps wirelessly, so how much more when you're paying for 200Mbps or 100Mbps? Then that Amazon EERO will only give you 100Mbps or 50Mbps wirelessly, almost anywhere your place, unlike MOST Tri-Band Mesh Routers, they can still give you 200 or 100Mbps...

Save your money, and just get WIFI 5 or WIFI 6, that's TRI BAND MESH ROUTER.

Have a great day to ya'll...",negative
401,Computers & Accessories,Amazon eero mesh WiFi system – router replacement for whole-home coverage (3-pack),$169.00,5,"I bought the bundle with three Eeros and Alexa, to set up the WiFi at my parent's house. Before I took it over there I set it up at my house and configured it here. I am only moderately familiar with network stuff, so I need to concentrate while setting it up, I don't want to be peppered with questions!

My existing network had two wireless access points. I have had them for years and they're very stable, I have no complaints. But the Eeros gave me much better speeds and coverage, I was super impressed. I was sad when I unplugged the Eeros from my house and took them to my parent's house. So I am going to buy a second set for my house.

Setting them up was not completely seamless, but it was close. The first one just worked, almost instantly. But the second one did not immediately work. It gave me an error message, can't recall exactly what is was. But then it offered me a firmware upgrade, and I accepted it. Then it just sat there like a lump, I could not tell if it was doing anything. After an hour it was still sitting. I just left it and went to bed, figuring I would call Eero in the morning. But in the morning, it had finished upgrading itself, and it just worked. I did not have to call support. So I would say, if you get one and have trouble, let it automatically upgrade itself and be patient.

One other bit of advice: The setup tells you to place them in spots spread through your house, pick their room names, and then it praises your choice of spots. This is a silly bells and whistles thing. Just line all three up on the table together and set the software up with them like that. Because it is annoying to be setting something up and running up and down stairs to plug things in and check whether the lights are on or whatever, especially if, like me, you get one that needs a software upgrade. Place them in their spots in the house, later. There is a screen in the app where you can change the room names if you end up moving them around, so you are not stuck with whatever room names you pick first.

I love the phone app, too. I can check my parent's network, without going over to their house. My mom has dementia and cannot remember why there is a row of little green lights, so she finds the plug and turns them off. When this happens I can see they are offline without going over there, and I can call them and talk them through plugging the modem back in. (After a few rounds of this I found a place to hide the modem, LOL!)

Within the Eero app there is a spot where you can turn off the white status light. This is good, I was able to darken the living room Eero and therefore reduce the likelihood it will be unplugged.

They can run in bridge mode, so when I install the next set at home, I can place them downstream of my wired router and my Pi-Hole (whole network ad blocker) will still work. They come with a 30-day trial of some other ad blocker, but it's nowhere near as good as my Pi-Hole so I will not buy it.

The bundle: I would never have bought an Alexa, but since it was bundled at the same price, I decided I might as well set it up for my dad. He has poor vision and it's hard for him to get out of his chair, so it's nice for him to be able to turn on music or make a phone call just by talking to Alexa. It's working so well that I have gone ahead and bought a smart plug and I am going to try my hand at creating an Alexa-controlled lamp for him. I like Alexa way more than I though I would.

Edit 7/4/2020: I am taking away a star. The unit that gave me trouble during my install of the first set, which seemed to be fixed by the firmware upgrade? I don’t think it is truly fixed. It has been intermittently failing for the last week. If I go out there and power cycle it, it might work for a while but it keeps failing again. Or if I ignore the failure it sometimes starts working again on its own. The other two carry on working fine even when this one is out of order. I suppose I will need to contact Eero about it.

Then yesterday I had a weird hiccup on my second set. The internet just stopped working. The Eero app said all was fine, but it would not restart, and would not let me save any setting changes, the app was just frozen. No amount of power cycling of Eeros and cable modems seemed to help. What fixed it was, I unplugged all the Eeros, then used my cell phone data to get online, then I brought up the app and it realized the Eeros were not responding, it finally displayed them as offline. Then I plugged them back in and they came back online normally and started working again. So apparently you need internet to fix the internet connection. Glad I have cellular data as a backup source of internet!

Anyways, I am taking away a star. I may give it back if Eero gives me decent support when I contact them. Because when the Eeros work they really are great. I just have this stability issue right now.

Edit 7/13/2020

I have been working with Eero support. They have been quick to answer and pleasant to work with, but they have not yet been able to resolve the issues with my one flaky unit. They worked with me on the phone, and emailed me some steps to try. Since the unit can be made to work if you tinker with it, but then fails again over time, it's slow to troubleshoot - you do something, it works, then you wait, and in a day or two it fails again. But I cannot trigger the failure while troubleshooting, so we just end up trying things and waiting and hoping that when it comes back up this time it will stay up. So far it has not. It's in a failed state again now and I have emailed them saying I think we have done enough and they should just replace it. I mean, the other five all work perfectly and there's nothing in the environment that should make this one any different.

I will update the review when something happens, and give them back their star if they send a new one and it works.

Edited 11/25/2020

Eero did send me a replacement unit, back in July. It works just fine. I have had no issues since.

I am bumping them up to five stars. Because they have been great.",positive
402,Computers & Accessories,Amazon eero mesh WiFi system – router replacement for whole-home coverage (3-pack),$169.00,3,"Update #3: Everything seems to be working ok now. I enabled IPv6 and everything seems to be connecting well and it is doing what I want it to.

I had more problems with my printers and the solution was to turn off IPv6 on the actual printer settings which would result in it finally popping up on the eero app's connected device list. From there I had to add it as an IPv4 reservation in the app's advanced settings. Using that IPv4 address of the printer, I connected both my Mac & Windows computer using the IP address.

These little guys do have surprising range on them. I ended up buying a 4th one for my garage which is probably about 80ft from the wired unit, with several walls to go through. I have another unit that is about 50ft from the wired unit between the 2. I wasn't sure if it was going to work, but it doubled my internet speed from about 30Mbps to around 70Mbps (paying for 100Mbps). Getting that 30+ Mbps from the unit that was around 45ft from where my computer was in the garage was actually a pleasant surprise.

Update #2:
So apparently it's a common problem for MacBook's and other idevice's to have problems with the eero. I read the forums from 2 YEARS ago as I was trying to figure out why my spouse's computer was not working/working really slow. After looking at the forums, it started w/ a rep saying there was no known problems and as others started chiming in, repetitively responding with a ""please call us"" rather than working through a solution, not expecting too much from the customer service. I would suggest researching the issues I've written below before making a decision.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update/Importants Recap: All seems to be working well now.

What you'll need to know:
• If you have printers connected over WIFI: You'll need to know how to connect your printer in a way other than WPS as it is not supported through eero.
• If you have UPNP media streaming through WIFI: You'll need to know how to do port forwarding through eero. Maybe eero will eventually fix its well known problems w/ UPNP.
• If your router (yes you do need a router, well modem, still) is a WIFI combo type router: you will want to know how to put it in bridge mode (if that's an option) and/or disable its WIFI capabilities (not 100% that you NEED to do this, but it should prevent device connection conflictions).
• If one of your eero's is periodically turning red: it's probably location related. Just because its closeish doesn't mean it's a good location. You have to consider the amount and types of walls it has to penetrate through to talk to another eero.
• If your app is having problems recognizing your eero, just flip it over and put the serial # in when the option pops up.
----------------------------------------
The Good:
1) When it does work properly, I do get a great increase in range and speed
2) I felt it was pretty easy to set up, I had to manually put in the serial #s of a couple, but no big deal

The Bad:
1) Your printers will likely stop working
2) Your media servers will likely stop working

The Details:
Ok, so here's my philosophy: I like to spend way too much time doing research and spending a little more money up front for items of quality in the hopes that they will last longer and work properly. I am not an IT specialist, but I use a wide range of electronics on a daily basis and I have done so much troubleshooting and workarounds that I can write a book. It's just become my nature to immediately search out a fix. I have had quite a few problems with the eero in the week I have owned it, and through research have found out it's not just me. Let me run you through a narrative to explain my journey and a journey you might likely find yourself in:

So your iPod stops working because it's so old, and/or you have to wide a taste in music that you want to stream your music from your computer to your Bluetooth headphones so you can go around your house and yard and do your stuff. You find out the range on your ""nice"" headphones sucks so you discover UPNP streaming from your computer to your phone so you can move around with just your phone. But you find that when you go in the yard, the Wi-Fi signal drops as the router is on the opposite side of the house, so you find out about mesh networks and since you don't need more that 100 Mbps, the eero will do just fine.

You start setting up the eero, you have to manually put in the serials of a couple of the nodes, no bid deal. You get it set up and all seems well. Then your spouse gets upset at you because she can't print anymore, and it was working perfectly fine before. You find out that eero has determined that WPS connections are insecure so they do not accept these connections (a big complaint from forums). So you have to go in and manually configure your printers, which can be a nightmare sometimes depending on the printer.

Printers are working again (Expect a couple hours of research and tinkering unless your an IT pro). Well, they were until your spouse was able to print again for some reason and now she's running late and without her papers. You monster your, why did you change the internet?? But it's ok, you can jam to some music and power through some more research right? lol...

So your UPNP streaming from your computer from your phone seems to work great the 1st time you try it out. You have no problems around the entire house and yard, wow amazing! But then it not only randomly stops working, but your server doesn't even show up at all. So back to the research... You find out from the forums that UPNP is a big problem with a LOT of users. Just like the WPS upset, you find a ton of complaints about UPNP problems.

From these forums, you find out about port forwarding. Good luck with that one if your again, not an IT specialist. You'll have to go deep into eero's advanced settings as well for this one. Once you spend hours getting that figured out and you go into the deep settings of your router to attempt to put it into bridged mode (if your router has that option) and/or turn off it's wireless feature (combo router), so as to prevent a competition between device connection.

Ok, disclaimer, part of the problem was my computers network settings that wouldn't allow it to communicate with devices on the network, but even after fixing that, I am still having issues of a variety of kinds and my spouse's devices are still too. Also we have a variety of Mac and Windows products, so expect this across all devices.

You decide, hey actually I think this one node would be better over here. Bad idea! You unplugged it and moved it and it maybe 10 feet and when it finally gets up and running again, it coincidentally has a bright red light and now you get to research why.

So after days of this, your printers are still not working, you have a red light on one and your music is off and on working. So that's where I am currently sitting as the bad guy who broke it all. Hopefully the above gave you all some places to start if you have similar problems. I will try to update this review if anything changes, but I'm off to more hours of research.

Oh also, I cannot attest to the customer service. Maybe they could have helped, but in my years of experience, it is usually far faster and less frustrating to just beat the keyboard until I figure it out than to try and resolve it over the phone. I have just spent so much time learning to fix and workaround things, it's just the way I am now. If you have ever tried to talk to Microsoft service reps on phone or in person, you would probably be scarred in that sense too!",fair
403,Computers & Accessories,Amazon eero mesh WiFi system – router replacement for whole-home coverage (3-pack),$169.00,5,"TLDR: I had Luma Wifi for 3 years, Google Wifi for 5 days, and finally Eero and I'm very happy with Eero so far.

Back in 2017 I was looking for whole home wifi. There was Eero, Luma Wifi, and Google Wifi. At least those were the brands I was looking at. Over the 3 years I really didn't have any problem with it. I mean it just sat back and did what it was supposed to. The last couple of months I noticed some issues with streaming and general slowness that I chalked up to everyone being at home using it all the time. I did a little research and Luma was sold back in 2018 and I never received an email or anything and the app had never had an update since then either. I guess that's why it was so stable. Luckily they left us on a stable build.

I started looking for a new Wifi device again. I'm a Nest Home so I looked at Eero and Google Wifi. I liked that Google Wifi will incorporate into the Google Home app with all my other Google items. I gave Eero a brief look but liked the form factor of Google Wifi a little better. So I purchased it on Wednesday and it showed up on Friday. I hooked them up and the hookup was a little clunky. Even the instructions were a bit confusing as it has you hook up the router then unplug your modem then boot the modem back up and plug in the Google Router. Then follow along on the app. It wasn't great. I finally get it set up and that's where the trouble started. Every 30 minutes to an hour the Google Wifi would just drop from existance. My Hue Hub was connected directly to my Modem so I could still access that from off network if I disabled wifi on my phone. But then the Wifi would mysteriously come back as quick as it disappeared. This happend on off for the next five days while working with Google Wifi support jumping through their hoops which consists of:

1. Unplug Modem, Google Router, Google Point
2. Wait 5 Minutes
3. Plug everything back in
4. See if it drops. Which it does.
5. Set DNS to 8.8.8.8 see if it drops it does
6. Set DNS to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 see if it drops it does
7. Set DNS to ISP DNS see if it drops it does.
8. Move the Google Point into the same room see if it drops it does
9. Turn off the point see if it drops it does
10. Reset all Google Devices to Factory Default and resetup see if it drops and it does.
11. Switch out the network cable.
12. Then they started blaming the ISP.
13. ISP comes out and changes all the cabling from the pole to the modem. Still drops.
14. Complete steps 1-10 again about 10 times.

I asked Google support to overnite me a new set so I could make sure it's not faulty and they said they could not do that. Even though I just bought it 5 days ago. I showed them evidence that my internet connection is working even thought there wifi is not by showing them a Laptop wired directly to my modem can access the internet while their Wifi connected to the internet was showing connection but Wifi was no where to be found.

At this point I was on day 4 growing more frustrated and decided to order EERO. It said it would be here in 2 days. It was here in 1 kudos Fedex and Amazon during these times I was expecting a longer wait. I unboxed Eero and started the process. The instructions in the box are simple. Download the EERO app. Create an account. Unplug your Modem. Follow the instructions in App.

It starts out saying you will have internet access in less than 10 minutes. They were spot on. The next step was to Plug one eero into the modem. Boot up the modem and boot up the eero. In the app it starts searching for the Eero and it finds it. You setup your SSID and password. I chose the same SSID and Password as the previous Wifi. It was up and running in less than 10 minutes. Your tasks aren't done at that point as it still does a software update and reboots one time but the wifi was up and running in under 10 minutes. I setup my kid for her profile and set her weekday bedtimes and weekend bedtimes. Very simple and easy to use. The speeds are on par with Google Wifi and way better than what I was getting with Luma. And as a bonus no Wifi drop outs. I've only had it plugged in for 14 hours but no drop outs.

Google support did reach out back to me with one last question. THey asked me how close my Google Router and Point were and I wrote back they are about an inch apart in the box. Sitting in a FedeX bin on their way back to you. You can keep those POS devices. I feel bad for the Wifi Support forum because there are about 10-15 posts on the same issue happening since March and in each post there are 5-10 new people complaining about the same thing. Apparently they either had a batch of bad hardware or a software update that affected a batch of hardware. I'm glad I finally made it to Eero. I'll update this after a bit of use since I've only had it for less than a day, so far I'm pleased.",positive
404,Computers & Accessories,Amazon eero mesh WiFi system – router replacement for whole-home coverage (3-pack),$169.00,4,"Negatives: Not as good as I had hoped. I bought system to replace a 5ish year old netgear 2g/ 5g wifi router with a crap Chinese wifi extenders that was maybe $20 here on Amazon. My current set up has the cable modem in the front of the house where the gateway is and I wanted to put 1 upstairs on the opposite side of the house and 1 downstairs on the opposite side of the house. Both of these locations were too far away the gateway and wouldn't work. Now, mind you the gateway and the old Netgear router are in the same place. I tried to set one of the Eero next to where I had the cheap Chinese wifi extender and it wouldn't connect. I feel like this new hi-tech wifi mesh system should have out performed the old set up. I guess I need to move the gateway to the middle of the house.
Took longer to connect and set up than what was expected. The gateway popped in as soon as I plugged it in. Took about 2 hours to set everything up. About 1/2 the time was moving and messing with the satellite eero that wouldn't connect. When they were connected to the gateway everything was smooth and simple. The instructions pretty much made it idiot proof!

Positive:
Went from 12 mbps to 238 mbps. All the TVs, laptops, alexa, rings and locks are firing like never before. Biggest difference I can see thus for are all security cameras are working amazing no lag on live feed or any pixelation.

I'll update once I get the gateway moved to the middle of the house and the rest reconfigured.",positive
405,Computers & Accessories,Amazon eero mesh WiFi system – router replacement for whole-home coverage (3-pack),$169.00,5,"The most impressive part about this setup was when I switched to Eero, I used the same WiFi name and password from my previous mesh WiFi. I didn't have to update any of my existing devices (kid's cell phones, computers, Smart TV's, etc) - they just assumed the new WiFi! When I've had to do a complete restore with my previous mesh router, I always used the same name and password for the WiFi, but had to go to every device and re-enter the WiFi settings in order for them to connect.

The setup process took MINUTES! Super simple (not that I can't handle more complicated) but with previous mesh routers, it's taken at least a good 20-30 minutes for various reasons, mostly because the firmware in the device needed to update.

I also love the fact that it allows for remote administration for an additional $2.99 per month so I can control the network when I'm not at home. It allows you to filter internet content for specific groups and setup bedtimes as well as randomly pause any time if needed. All of this is extremely simple to setup, simplest setup ever!!

Highly recommend for any home network!!",positive
406,Computers & Accessories,Amazon eero mesh WiFi system – router replacement for whole-home coverage (3-pack),$169.00,5,"I did hours and hours of research over weeks to decide what mesh units to go with. I decided on the Eero 3-pack for my needs, because I've read of the headaches other mesh systems caused people and I didn't have a need for one with a speaker or anything like that. Going from a 10 year old router with a single 2.4Ghz band to these units is a big difference. My house is roughly 3100 sq ft and is 120 years old, with thicker walls of plaster over wood, and who knows what sort of older wires and such in the walls themselves. Despite the original router being in roughly the center of the house, I would have a very weak signal that frequently dropped off my desktop. The 3 Eero units have been up for barely a day and it's a marked improvement. I have noticed that they run a tad warm, but not any warmer than the box we use for cable (not the modem, but what's actually connected to the TV). We did sit them on coasters as a precaution considering the age of the furniture the devices sit on.

Set Up:
Relatively easy. My phone and the Eero units wouldn't connect via bluetooth for some reason, so I had to manually enter each serial number, but once I did the units were found in the app and recognized each other and main one. The actual set up from there was easy. I found good locations for the other 2 units and the app informed me I'd chosen great locations for them.

App:
I like the app. I prefer it over a computer-based website I would need to access, and I like that I can monitor what devices are connected from my phone. The app walked me through the setup and it didn't take me long to figure out how to make some changes to things and take advantage of some of the customization options. There is some discrepancies with the speeds the app tells me the various devices are getting and what the devices themselves tell me they are getting. I also like that I can see which devices are connected to which unit and the band that they're on. For some reason some devices jump between the bands rather than sticking to the same band, but that isn't an issue for me. I also don't mind that I can't select which devices use which band. With so few devices connected compared to other homes, interference isn't a concern.

Strength: Noticeably stronger. My phone has full signal in my room where before I had maybe 2 bars at the most. My desktop is at 70-80% strength, which isn't surprising given that it's still 20-30 feet from each of the 2 units and also likely due to the wireless network card I'm using, but it's stable and hasn't dropped at all once the units updated themselves through the app (dropped just once when the units were updating, but likely because it's more sensitive to signal strength and connection strength).

Speed: This hasn't been an issue. Some social media images are slightly slower to load on my phone, but I spend more time on my desktop and everything works perfectly. I was able to watch episodes and such without any buffering or other issues; before with the old router I would have to pause episodes to let more load so it wouldn't buffer on me and it would take twice as long to watch something. I'll have a console in November and will be better be able to judge stability and strength with it as well, but at this stage I'm not anticipating having trouble.

I didn't contact tech support at all, so I haven't rated it. I have my own security options in place on the various devices, so I did not do the eero Security trial or anything to do with that. Also, this is not a smarthome. We have no smart devices connected and will not ever have smart devices connected to these units, so I cannot comment on those. We will have, at most, 6 devices connected to the wifi at any one time, and usually just 5. There is one desktop with a wired connection to the unit connected to the modem, so that one doesn't affect the wifi. I did turn on band steering in the app to help my desktop and such in my room have a stronger signal. I am not planning on using the guest option at all. I'll update this review if necessary if I run into problems later on or if there are any changes with how the units work or how I use them.",positive
407,Computers & Accessories,Amazon eero mesh WiFi system – router replacement for whole-home coverage (3-pack),$169.00,4,"I had a dead Wi-Fi spot in my bedroom & purchased 1 Eero thinking it was like a Wi-Fi extender & I could just set it up in my room. Wrong. If you purchase one it has to be directly connected to your modem. I have Xfinity & easily connected it & set it up. I turned off my Xfinity modem network (I didn’t want 2 separate networks appearing as Eero creates its own network) by turning on “bridge mode”. Google helped in doing this. After I set it up I moved the Eero to my room & that’s when I realized additional devices were needed. Completely my error, but I wish I read this somewhere before I purchased it. As I work from that bedroom I need Wi-Fi & ended up purchasing the 3 pack & returning the single device. So far so good. Just know that a single Eero isn’t gonna do much & it’s better to buy the multipack to save the headache & time that I went through. The set up was easy, but a little time consuming as each Eero didn’t always want to connect & required a lot of turning on/off.",positive
408,Computers & Accessories,Amazon eero mesh WiFi system – router replacement for whole-home coverage (3-pack),$169.00,5,"Yes it is TRUE !! it did increase the speed and gave full coverage of my house!!!
I bought this as a bundle along with ARRIS SB8200 Modem Docsis 3.1.
Installation was very very easy with respect to the devices (MODEM + EERO MESH 6). Need to chat with my ISP since this is the first time I am upgrading from DOCSIS 3.0 to 3.1 and to register this new device with them. If you were with the same dilemma like me, you will see a tremendous increase in Internet speed (you will be surprised by looking at my attached screenshots). Yes I did with doubt for a year to make a decision of upgrading my modem to 3.1 whether it will truly improve the internet speed or is it just a business strategy by ISPs in the market. But now I have to admit it is TRUE. 3.1 upgrade is needed if you do WFH or have multiple device streaming.
I have not explored its full capacity of how many devices it can handle, for now only 16 devices connected and it does it's job with justification.
But I did verify the coverage and it has improved 100%.

In layman terms - ARRIS SB8200 is a modem and does not have an inbuilt router in it. The EERO MESH 6 does the job of a router (physically 3 router devices at your house with the same WIFI name to connect to your devices).
So, No need to manually switch to connect to these MESH devices as we normally do with a WIFI extender. Wherever I move around my house there is a MESH device to back my N/W coverage. I believe it can easily cover 5000 SQFT as they promised. Whenever there is a switch of MESH device happens I can see the coverage strength drop for a second and then regain its full strength in seconds.

I am satisfied so far with this device as far as the coverage, signal strength all over the house and its perimeter (garage, driveway, backyard) and most importantly for the competitive price in the market when compared to the price range of a Netgear ORBI.",positive
409,Computers & Accessories,Amazon eero mesh WiFi system – router replacement for whole-home coverage (3-pack),$169.00,5,I left these in the box for a while because I was worried that it was going to be a difficult process to set them up. We had a major internet outage and had to have our router replaced so I switched to these. Previously we had a special booster box on the other side of our house. I spread the three of these out evenly and we have had no dead spots so far and no difficulties. It was very easy to set up with the app. I am waiting for my 30 days to be up to see if they try and charge me just to use them. It did give me a 30 day free subscription to something.

If you read nothing below, take my word for it, don’t invest in products this company sells. They’re not selling quality long-lasting, reliable electronics, nor do they provide good service to their customers... they’re selling poor functioning, quick to fail, seemingly manufactured with little to no attention to quality, nor consumer satisfaction priority. They're overcharging for crappy products, seemingly taking advantage of their customers financially & other ways.... profiting selfishly from un-integral business practices. I share this information after communicating with several other customers, family, friends, colleagues, all you share this terrible experience, some even worse than mine, which is why I feel compelled to share this with other potential buyers.
Apple, unlike this company, provides extremely quality products that evolve & improve over time, that not only do the customers profit greatly due to the quality of their products & Customer Service, they profit as a company who'll continue thriving I’m sure many lifetimes beyond my feeble human imagination. In the past, I perceived they were ripping me off but time & time again I have felt, & thus can rely that I will feel this same way in the future, that I got something worth what I paid & sometimes more.
****First things first, I am not the account holder of this account, I purchased this router through this account administrator because she’s family. So, any bad juju anyone would like to share, or feedback/questions of any kind, is welcomed by me. I will not re-enter this account for responses of feedback, I am the account admin for Elena Mae Brown. I'm sure I'm easy to find if you would like to reach me.
Lucky for any readers of this review, I have all the time in the world to write it because I have no internet to do the extensive work, I must take care of. Simply furthers my argument that this NETGEAR company fails to take care of their customers... BELOW IS A NOVEL WITH SEVERAL GRAMMATICAL ERRORS THAT I WILL NOT DEDICATE ANY MORE OF MY TIME TO FIXXING... I suppose I’m off to the library or a coffee shop since I have no internet thanks to good old NETGEAR…
Today, I got to experience the ultimate joy of something we’ve all experienced as adults in the modern technological age. My Internet failed in & out all day long, on the phone with different companies & different individuals in different departments for hours on end, my valuable time was devalued extensively. & despite my time dedication, I got zero resolution of my problem.
Since moving into our new apartment in January, we have only had her Internet go out two times & quickly called spectrum or promptly taken care of & our problem was resolved. Today I did the same, as always, they provided me with any & every possible service they make readily available to all customers throughout all times of day no matter how much time it takes to resolve any issues on their part. After calling Spectrum & them concluding that there was absolutely no problem on their end, they guided me to call NETGEAR to assist me with Resolving my router dysfunction.
The cherry on top, oh what a lovely surprise It was, to be told by the service representative on the phone following being on hold for 30 minutes, that the router we purchased months ago (late July) is no longer under their responsibility as far as Technical Support? So, their Technical Support offering had an extremely short limited time warranty which I was not informed of a purchase I’m completely appalled by when I compare it to my experiences with other companies.
{{Never in my entire life have I ever contacted a manufacture of an electronic device that I own  , has any company ever failed to provide me with the ultimate time consuming technical service over the phone or via my giving them access to the device while remaining on the line with them during which I get to watch them move the mouse & make all these changes & technical coding entrances, & my issues are always resolved before the communication with said manufactures comes to an end — A few examples: Epson, Tyson, Microsoft, Apple, Xbox, automatic sensor receptive no touched rash can manufacture, & the list goes on}
So, what does background information you could see that this experience would be very upsetting & disappointing in the company that I am vested financially & providing me with unnecessary expensive piece of technology.
So, in attempt to summarize this review, I went ahead & called the phone number that Spectrum had so generously & promptly offered to give me, & after a long ridiculous time on hold, I was greeted by a woman on the phone, to whom I expressed my issue I need for a solution, & The manner in which she communicated with me was completely absurd, Constant interruption in the middle of myself talking, terrible attitude, seemed irritated & bothered by my call.
From my experience & understanding of severely perfect customer service validating the customer is always right, I determined this exchange as 100% inappropriate Customer Service.
Following her terrible communication practice, she stated that the only way she was able to troubleshoot the device was for me to pay immediately: $89 & then this payment I would receive three more months of them providing need technical service & support over the phone. What was the most odd about the woman trying to convince me of this deal, was that she repeated over & over & over, that not only will they service this piece of technology but all the technology pieces in my home for 3 whole months! At this point I promptly informed her that every company I’ve ever purchased any expensive piece of technology from has taken care of me throughout my entire ownership of varying companies products, always treating me as an extremely valued customer & ensuring that not only can I count on them as companies to purchase from in the future, but that their top priority was customer satisfaction simply provided through the electronics functioning at highest capacity thanks to their lifelong assistance (I listed over 8 companies who’ve provided this). Even after I explained this extensively, she repeated w/ my $80 payment, they would take care of all my technology? Having already proven themselves unwilling to care for the single device of theirs I own… unfortunately I repeated myself several times rapidly over & over & over because she kept interrupting, not my finest hour, that I didn’t need that because other companies take care of me endlessly following my purchasing any & every devices from them. All of a sudden after my repeating myself way too many times, out of the blue, suddenly she offered me a deal for $40 through which I would get all the same services. My mind @ this point is legitimately blown.
I made it clear that I was unwilling to financially pay for services that any company I’ve ever worked with provides readily & happily to me as the customer. She put me on hold after telling me that she was going to go ask her boss if she could do anything. Cherry on top? Comes back on the line & says “OK so, I got permission from my boss to do this troubleshooting for you one time only for free & I’m going to do it right now”
Finally, the grand finale! I called that disconnected, at the beginning of the call she confirmed the callback number for me if we got disconnected & unfortunately no longer to my surprise, she did not call back & has not followed up at all.
I invested in this next year router because I had heard great things from those who use them & was willing to pay the extra money to get a quality product.
Unfortunately (& fortunately I suppose...), I learned a lot through this exchange. I’ve taken for granted how impressive businesses & manufacturing companies etc., are with absolute 100% unignorable & so damn overwhelmingly delightful their upmost dedication to customer care, respect, readiness & willingness to help in a moment’s notice, & their clear priority of maximizing each buyers satisfaction with the product manufactured by them, made crystal clear by the sense of feeling taken care of that I have following any communication with them… this revelations have come to my attention as more important to me than anything from any company ’ll invest in for life.
In conclusion, I find gratitude from this experience not only because I learned that this company is not one I will ever invest in nor recommend others investing, but additionally because it taught me how important it is to make sure anyone we provide service to as human beings feels taken care of especially in cases when they are taken care of us, for example financially & purchasing a service or product. Initially I was filled with rage & out of my mind, following this expression & honesty with other consumers out there, I feel like peace & hope that either customers will go another direction as far as the company they choose for their Internet router, or, which I Believe possible 100%, that this company can alter their practices starting with me by following through on commitment that was made to call me back… & overtime treat their customers with other respect & expression of how much we are valued because without us, any company fails. I’m surprised if any single human being read this entire review but I hope it has some sort of positive impact on any individuals reading or on the company… Call back won’t fix this for me, & without any greater action on their part as a company I will never again purchased from them & will give my honest opinion to every single person who asks me about them as a company.
I’m an advocate for creating a world in which every single human enjoys & loves waking up every day to a life filled with love, connection, & the internal understanding & deep rooted knowing of the reality that there’s nothing more valuable then each individual alone (we each are equally as valuable as any other human on this planet). Stand up, speak up, express your vulnerabilities & your strengths openly with as many people as you possibly can because this will have a profound impact. Splashed in a small bite of my philosophy.
So much time with my cellular data to write a review, but zero Internet connection to do my work… NETGEAR, do better, not for the selfish gain of your profits, but for the human beings such as yourself Who like you, valuable & deserve to be taken care of & feel taken care of by those that they trust. I’m sure you’re a massive corporation… Or owned by some other national business conglomerate… The number of you is absolutely not important, what is important is the each of you dedicate your hearts & your lives to treating others as your heart aches for people to treat you. Signing off, I hope you reach out NETGEAR make it up to me as well as any other customer whose experienced such a terrible experience of customer service. I understand fees & charges overtime, I do not except fees & charges I am not informed of at the beginning of my initial purchase being imposed on me when I simply need assistance...
To all of you individuals out there, just like myself & just like every other person but you crossed paths with each & every day, but I know how important you are & how were the you are of everything beautiful in the world & a heart overflowing with joy & fulfillment. Things won’t change unless each one of us changes.

It will provide fantastic speeds and will be a nice upgrade for older routers not capable of keeping up with the increasing internet speeds provided today by most ISPs.

Unfortunately, Netgear decided to dramatically change the internal components and then still sell it under the same name (R6700). With that said, Amazon has a little product alert indicating either R6700 or R6700v2. Well, they are shipping the R6700v2 which does not match some of the specifications shown on this page (in particular the CPU speed).

I know because after receiving a router that did not match, they offered to replace it and send the first version of the router (the one with the higher clock speeds as indicated on the actual product details) and ended up receiving the same thing (another V2).

I will say that for those interested in a router that will not be flashed with custom software or that will not use other more advanced functions a router can provide, this is no problem. For those of us that know the hardware and know what we are expecting, that is a problem.

I have it a 3 star because any company that makes an original version with better specs and then turns around and significantly changes this without changing the model number and making minor modifications on the box (see amazon's own photos - both boxes are pictured) simply does not deserve my trust. Speaking of ratings, many of the ratings you see here are lumped up with other Netgear products and also apply to the original more capable version.

I encourage you do your research and check reviews from different sources. This way, you will not be disappointed with the V2 that you will receive. I hope this help you make your decision!",fair

My research said the R6700 was one of the best access points also.

WIRED PERFORMANCE:
-- Ive installed the R6700 router with 4ea D-Link unmanaged 1G switches to reach all the locations in my home and sometimes cascaded the switches and everything works great. (I mention cascading switches because in the past I have had issue when cascading switches but not issues with this setup)
-- BETTER WIRED PERFORMANCE: I have a 8 wireless camera security system that uses its own wireless Network Video Recorder and some of the cameras have poor signal so now switched them over to the wired 1G backbone. A marked improvement in the video update and even the control on the Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ) cameras is instantly responsive
-- GREAT STATUS LIGHTS: The Ethernet port activity lights are great because they have different colors depending on the speed of the network connection. This is really handy when installed a mix of 100M and 1G links so you can tell if things are connected as you planned.

WiFi PERFORMANCE:
-- The Nighthawk replaced a 13 year old wireless router (D-Link 605L) using only a 2.4Ghz wireless network.
-- SAME 2.4G PERFORMANCE: When comparing speeds from my normal laptop wireless location I have not noticed any real improvement in the signal strength nor the connection speed for the old router to the new R6700 at 2.4G.
-- GREAT 5G Performance. When comparing 2.4G to 5G there was typically at 70% improvement in throughput speed from the same laptop.
-- FLEXIBLE CONFIGURATION: Once can turn off the wireless totally or just the 2.4G or the 5G. This is just a nice feature to lower your wireless risk footprint say if you only use 2.4G.

ROUTER CONFIGURATION:
-- EASY SETUP: It was easy to setup the router. In my case I set up the R6700 to match the configuration of the D-link it replaced so I did not have any issues with all the other devices in the house connecting.
-- It went fairly smoothly, but on my laptop I did have to delete the original connection and reconnect to get it to work.
-- VERY SOPHISTICATED: It has some very sophisticated configuration possibilities all of which I will never use.
-- There are 3 levels of configuration with each level allowing more and more complex and detailed setups.
-- I was surprised that to turn off the 5G wireless I had to drill down to the 3rd level to find that config. Seems like that would be a very basic config setting.
-- I really love the display that provides several indicators to give one an instant view of the health and operation of the unit.

COULD BE BETTER:
-- NEEDS MOUNTING TABS: I do wish it had some mechanical mounting capability to secure to a shelf or mount vertically on a wall but its simply a shelf item. With all the cables hanging off the back there is some weight there that wants to pull the Nighthawk off the shelf.
-- STATUS LIGHT ORIENTATION: The status lights are best viewed when looking down on the R6700. When straight its difficult. It would have been better if the lights were mounting at a 45 degree so they could easily be viewed straight on as well.

UPDATE: I purchased a 2nd R6700 and installed in the same network above as an access point. It was easy to set up using a fixed IP and the 5G performance was better than 2X the 2.4G network. And of course the 1G Ethernets are great as I have several security cameras running over the network.",positive

But the mash on top blocks ""a good potion of"" air that its just adequate. I would have preferred a grill style cover for above the fan area.
- Adjustment does not lock, so if you pick it up it flops around.
- Would have preferred they have 2 larger fans instead of 1 large and 4 smaller fans.
- Manual stats that you use a wall phone charger instead of power bank. The USB A - A cable provided is too short for that. You will need a minimum of 10 feet USB A-A cable or flimsy a/c outlet for that to work even when you are next to the wall outlet.
- Blue LEDs!! What are these for?
- The cooling is adequate as many said in their reviews but for me I would prefer more fan speed , more open air flow, with long wire provided.
- Extra usb port (1 is used for power) is moot.
- The on/off feature is fine but the fan speed control is not really changing any thing at all.

Over all, I'm kind of meh! on this product. You will need to add a minimum of very long extension cord.
Mod the mash on top of the fan to improve air flow. Clip the Blue LED's. And mod the foot, so that the adjustment arm locks in place.

If you are welling to put up with the above issues, you will be happy with the product. Subtract ten bucks from the price and it will be fair.

For the last ~3 weeks I have tried out a number of ""gaming"" laptop coolers ranging from 30-80 USD. This unit is surprisingly the best, even better than those blower fan style coolers...

The biggest issue with previous ones I tried is that either their adjustable fan settings were too weak, or (blower fan style models) the air intake was on the top in the back which is where 99% of all gaming laptops hot air output is, so it was essentially feeding the laptop it's own hot air... So for those to call themselves gaming coolers is hilarious.

As mentioned in the title and other reviewers pointed out, this unit feels very cheap, so be very careful when handling, other than that it works perfect for dissipating large amounts of heat quickly and efficiently!

Well I tell you what, that's not true. Like I said I got that incompatibility message with an actual authentic Dell ac adapter that came with my computer and so it seems like that's just a quirk message that computers come up with when a cord is worn out or not perfect in some way. I considered buying this cord about a month ago but didn't because of the negative reviews that had photos that seemed to prove that these cords were misleading about being compatible and working with Dell computers. Once I got that message on my screen from using my own Dell ac adapter, that threw my worries of the negative reviewers being correct out the window and so I went for it and bought the one on Amazon that I felt might be most reliable based on the positive reviews. And I am not disappointed. The ac adapter works great. My Dell ac adapter that seems like it was probably worn, I had to jiggle the cord all around during all the time to get it to the right spot in the computer socket, where the cord plugs into the computer, so that it was actually showing that it was providing power to my computer. I would check this by checking the battery icon on my taskbar. Now with this new ac adapter I just got from Amazon, no more jiggling for it to work properly. Works just as it should, wonderfully. Absolutely fantastic. Would buy again. I hope this helps anyone else who is struggling inside as I was on whether or not to buy this ac adapter. And also for families who are needing a more affordable option - I bought this and it works absolutely great with charging my computer. It even actually comes with an alternative size plug to suit the variety of computers it says it should work with. I attached photos of the two different sizes it comes with. I'll update this review if I have any problems in the near future. This does come with a two year manufacturer's warranty and my original ac adapter from Dell pooped out after only three years so the two year warranty is pretty fair and worth it in my opinion.

I have to unplug the HDMI cable and plug it back in to get the screen to come back one. This doesn't happen with the first hub I purchased. I have flip flopped the monitors between the 2 hubs to see if it was just an issue with connected monitor. I have used different USB C ports on my Macbook. I have used the 2nd hub just stand alone. The issue only occurs with the second hub I purchased in any configuration I've tried. So I guess this would be a quality control issue. Not the biggest problem, just annoying.",positive

TL;DR: It basically works as expected and I can confirm that it doesn't use DisplayLink.

I contacted UTechSmart before purchase to confirm if this device used USB-C HDMI Alt-mode instead of a DisplayLink chip. They confirmed it uses the former and said that though they had not tested it with a Pocket 2, if it didn't work I could return it no questions asked. Bonus points to them for that.
For reference, I'm using it with a GPD Pocket 2 (late 2018 product refresh using an Intel m3-8100Y CPU), running Windows 10 LTSC 2019 and a mixture of GPD and first-party drivers (mostly direct from Intel and Realtek). This is not how it comes from GPD, and is most definitely NOT a supported configuration by either GPD or Microsoft. I'm using the latest Intel drivers available (26.20.100.7000) from the Intel site.
The only persistent issue is that on my device, if second-screen mode default (Win+P) is set to duplicate or extend then neither screen will display when the hub is first plugged in. After a few seconds one of the screens will start working again. If the default is second screen only then it will work immediately. Once external display is working, using the Win+P shortcut to switch to duplicate or extend works correctly. This is most likely a Windows or driver issue.
For reference the Pocket 2 has a 1920x1200 screen that I use at 150% scaling and I mostly used 1920x1080 @100% scale monitors for testing. No HDMI adapters were used and I tested with two different known-good cables. Monitors tested were two Dell S2240L, one LG IPS234, and a Panasonic TCP50GT25. I also tested on a 4k Samsung UN50NU6950 and it reported output 4k@30fps, which is close enough to the Intel UHD 615 spec for HDMI 1.4.
This hub can function without external power, but if you have problems, try connecting power before you connect it to your computer. When I used it for the first time, it wouldn't appear to work without external power, but after some unrelated software and driver updates, now it does. For me, this issue was definitely on the host side, not the hub side.
The network chip is a Realtek RTL8153 USB 3 to gigabit Ethernet adapter. I own several devices that use this chip and it is serviceable, but tends to reset or drop out under sustained gigabit traffic. This is a characteristic of either the chip or Realtek's drivers, and there isn't really anything UTechSmart can do about it. (The other common providers of low cost USB->Ethernet chips (e.g. the ASIX AX88179) often have the same problems.) Below max speed, the 8153 works without any problems. As an aside, if you have one of these chips in a standalone usb adapter, you can plug it into a USB 2 port to get a trouble-free 250-350 Mb/s without having to babysit it.
I haven't tried stress-testing how much power you can get from the USB 3.0 ports, nor have I tried to saturate the USB-C link with simultaneous video, network, and USB SSD file transfer traffic. It doesn't really fit my use case for the device, and if doing so didn't work or caused the hub to drop connection it wouldn't necessarily be the hub's fault anyway.
One feature of the GPD Pocket 2 is that it can charge from any 5V source, not just from a USB-C PD charger. So I tried to power the hub with a regular USB power bank that can output 5V@1.8A (Soshine E3S). When charging directly, the Pocket 2 increases current draw until the voltage begins to sag below 5V. This is normal behavior and prevents the device from pulling too much current from the charger. But when I power the hub and indirectly charge the device, the power bank's over-current protection immediately trips. For whatever reason, the hub prevents the Pocket 2 from noticing the voltage drop in time to prevent a fault. A higher output 5V source, or a proper USB-C PD power bank would probably work just fine. It's just too much for a smaller power bank.
So in summary it works well, the price ($40 at time of purchase) is competitive with other similar products, and if I needed another I would start looking at UTechSmart first.",positive

After some digging into the issue, it seems this has been a common problem the plagues USB C adapters, and may be due to the connection being loose, or the hub overheating, and the hub not being able to supply all the power necessary to maintain connection. So I needed a hub that had PD so that power draw would always be sufficient to maintain connection. This hub has worked as advertised, It hasn't disconnected once, and I have plugged 3 external hard drives, in addition to the Ethernet port, and getting very fast speeds, well over 400 Mbps on my 400 Mbps plan, and upload speeds are as advertised as well. So far I am very happy with the purchase, I will update this review once I have used the HDMI port.
Update: 7.15.22
My laptop no longer recognizes the USB Hub. I contacted customer service to request a warranty replacement, and they shipped one out within a couple days. After sthinking about why the first hub failed, I believe it could be a heat issue. I have 3 external USB SSDs connected to the hub along with the Ethernet port, and the USB C power delivery port to provide the necessary power. I notice it gets quite warm, so I have been monitoring the heat, and placing it on a cooling pad, which keeps it from getting too hot. I wish I didn't have to use the cooling pad, but I'm pretty sure that was what led to the other hub failing.",positive

This USB C hub worked perfectly as an Ethernet adapter for Google TV so this is the first hub that I have been able to test as an additional storage hub. I also wanted this hub to increase the storage capacity of my Chromecast with Google TV. However, despite using a 65W power supply for the hub, I could not see any of the attached USB flash drives. I tried multiple formats including Fat32, drives with only a few files and drives from 32 to 128 GB, but this did not seem to make a difference. All of the flash drives could be read if I plugged them directly into the USB 2.0 port on my Samsung TV. This USB C hub also worked when plugged into a desktop computer. I did some more research and I ran across warnings from Samsung that a USB hub should not be used in the TV USB ports, with no indication why. It appears that most people who are using a USB C hub to increase storage for Google TV have newer vintage TVs than mine, and their TV is not a Samsung. My Samsung Smart TV is 11 years old and like most older Smart TVs it is becoming progressively Dumb, as apps are removed and new ones cannot be added. In fact, I added the Google for TV to this TV so that I would have access to apps that could not be downloaded. After 2 failures to find a hub that worked as an Ethernet adapter, and this hub worked as an Ethernet adapter but not to add storage, I now suspect that it is the Samsung TV that cannot read the attached flash drives in a hub through the Google device. So I can't use this hub if the TV will not recognize it, and I'll just get a Google branded Ethernet adapter. As long as the TV continues to work, I see no reason to buy a new TV and I'll just continue to work within the limited storage on the Google for TV device. Clearly it would be much better if Smart TVs did not become Dumb TVs, and if streaming devices actually included a reasonable amount of storage or you could add storage without having to add third party devices.",positive

This is my first use, so I can't speak to longevity. However, it's what i need for my browsing, online purchasing and for watching youtube videos about fixing stuff around my home. At work we used Lenovo. High end and great. Then we switched to Asus spin. Even better except the Lenovo felt sturdier.
This samsung replaced the Lenovo I purchased after feeling so impressed with the work Lenovo. Indeed, It lasted several years. The case cracked after dropping it, but it powered through. The nail in the coffin was a dip in a full bathtub. (Wish I could blame it on the kids...but it was my fault.)
I decided on this one because i never used the ""table"" mode or the touch screen. Thought i'd save money by passing on those features and instead having a bit fast processor.
This was is simple, clean and no frills. The screen is obviously not as nice as the Lenovo and It only has one chanrging ""C"" port, (the Lenovo had one on each side which was surprisingly handy.

I was looking for a better tablet, something with a real keyboard that I could do my writing on.

Sure, as long as I'm in Wi-Fi range of a public access point I can use Google Docs, but I wanted something I could use at the park or while out on the road. I also wanted to run LibreOffice, which you can't do on Chromebook, because, again, it's just a glorified web browser.
As to the actual device, I found the screen to be less than ideal. My Fire tablet has a much better screen; the Samsung screen comes off looking a bit blurry in comparison. The screen is not touch-sensitive, which didn't bother me, but the touchpad for cursor control doesn't have mouse buttons, and I had issues with the button-click emulation.

If you read nothing below, take my word for it, don’t invest in products this company sells. They’re not selling quality long-lasting, reliable electronics, nor do they provide good service to their customers... they’re selling poor functioning, quick to fail, seemingly manufactured with little to no attention to quality, nor consumer satisfaction priority. They're overcharging for crappy products, seemingly taking advantage of their customers financially & other ways.... profiting selfishly from un-integral business practices. I share this information after communicating with several other customers, family, friends, colleagues, all you share this terrible experience, some even worse than mine, which is why I feel compelled to share this with other potential buyers.
Apple, unlike this company, provides extremely quality products that evolve & improve over time, that not only do the customers profit greatly due to the quality of their products & Customer Service, they profit as a company who'll continue thriving I’m sure many lifetimes beyond my feeble human imagination. In the past, I perceived they were ripping me off but time & time again I have felt, & thus can rely that I will feel this same way in the future, that I got something worth what I paid & sometimes more.

Lucky for any readers of this review, I have all the time in the world to write it because I have no internet to do the extensive work, I must take care of. Simply furthers my argument that this NETGEAR company fails to take care of their customers... BELOW IS A NOVEL WITH SEVERAL GRAMMATICAL ERRORS THAT I WILL NOT DEDICATE ANY MORE OF MY TIME TO FIXXING... I suppose I’m off to the library or a coffee shop since I have no internet thanks to good old NETGEAR…
Today, I got to experience the ultimate joy of something we’ve all experienced as adults in the modern technological age. My Internet failed in & out all day long, on the phone with different companies & different individuals in different departments for hours on end, my valuable time was devalued extensively. & despite my time dedication, I got zero resolution of my problem.
Since moving into our new apartment in January, we have only had her Internet go out two times & quickly called spectrum or promptly taken care of & our problem was resolved. Today I did the same, as always, they provided me with any & every possible service they make readily available to all customers throughout all times of day no matter how much time it takes to resolve any issues on their part. After calling Spectrum & them concluding that there was absolutely no problem on their end, they guided me to call NETGEAR to assist me with Resolving my router dysfunction.
The cherry on top, oh what a lovely surprise It was, to be told by the service representative on the phone following being on hold for 30 minutes, that the router we purchased months ago (late July) is no longer under their responsibility as far as Technical Support? So, their Technical Support offering had an extremely short limited time warranty which I was not informed of a purchase I’m completely appalled by when I compare it to my experiences with other companies.
{{Never in my entire life have I ever contacted a manufacture of an electronic device that I own  , has any company ever failed to provide me with the ultimate time consuming technical service over the phone or via my giving them access to the device while remaining on the line with them during which I get to watch them move the mouse & make all these changes & technical coding entrances, & my issues are always resolved before the communication with said manufactures comes to an end — A few examples: Epson, Tyson, Microsoft, Apple, Xbox, automatic sensor receptive no touched rash can manufacture, & the list goes on}
So, what does background information you could see that this experience would be very upsetting & disappointing in the company that I am vested financially & providing me with unnecessary expensive piece of technology.
So, in attempt to summarize this review, I went ahead & called the phone number that Spectrum had so generously & promptly offered to give me, & after a long ridiculous time on hold, I was greeted by a woman on the phone, to whom I expressed my issue I need for a solution, & The manner in which she communicated with me was completely absurd, Constant interruption in the middle of myself talking, terrible attitude, seemed irritated & bothered by my call.
From my experience & understanding of severely perfect customer service validating the customer is always right, I determined this exchange as 100% inappropriate Customer Service.
Following her terrible communication practice, she stated that the only way she was able to troubleshoot the device was for me to pay immediately: $89 & then this payment I would receive three more months of them providing need technical service & support over the phone. What was the most odd about the woman trying to convince me of this deal, was that she repeated over & over & over, that not only will they service this piece of technology but all the technology pieces in my home for 3 whole months! At this point I promptly informed her that every company I’ve ever purchased any expensive piece of technology from has taken care of me throughout my entire ownership of varying companies products, always treating me as an extremely valued customer & ensuring that not only can I count on them as companies to purchase from in the future, but that their top priority was customer satisfaction simply provided through the electronics functioning at highest capacity thanks to their lifelong assistance (I listed over 8 companies who’ve provided this). Even after I explained this extensively, she repeated w/ my $80 payment, they would take care of all my technology? Having already proven themselves unwilling to care for the single device of theirs I own… unfortunately I repeated myself several times rapidly over & over & over because she kept interrupting, not my finest hour, that I didn’t need that because other companies take care of me endlessly following my purchasing any & every devices from them. All of a sudden after my repeating myself way too many times, out of the blue, suddenly she offered me a deal for $40 through which I would get all the same services. My mind @ this point is legitimately blown.
I made it clear that I was unwilling to financially pay for services that any company I’ve ever worked with provides readily & happily to me as the customer. She put me on hold after telling me that she was going to go ask her boss if she could do anything. Cherry on top? Comes back on the line & says “OK so, I got permission from my boss to do this troubleshooting for you one time only for free & I’m going to do it right now”
Finally, the grand finale! I called that disconnected, at the beginning of the call she confirmed the callback number for me if we got disconnected & unfortunately no longer to my surprise, she did not call back & has not followed up at all.
I invested in this next year router because I had heard great things from those who use them & was willing to pay the extra money to get a quality product.
Unfortunately (& fortunately I suppose...), I learned a lot through this exchange. I’ve taken for granted how impressive businesses & manufacturing companies etc., are with absolute 100% unignorable & so damn overwhelmingly delightful their upmost dedication to customer care, respect, readiness & willingness to help in a moment’s notice, & their clear priority of maximizing each buyers satisfaction with the product manufactured by them, made crystal clear by the sense of feeling taken care of that I have following any communication with them… this revelations have come to my attention as more important to me than anything from any company ’ll invest in for life.
In conclusion, I find gratitude from this experience not only because I learned that this company is not one I will ever invest in nor recommend others investing, but additionally because it taught me how important it is to make sure anyone we provide service to as human beings feels taken care of especially in cases when they are taken care of us, for example financially & purchasing a service or product. Initially I was filled with rage & out of my mind, following this expression & honesty with other consumers out there, I feel like peace & hope that either customers will go another direction as far as the company they choose for their Internet router, or, which I Believe possible 100%, that this company can alter their practices starting with me by following through on commitment that was made to call me back… & overtime treat their customers with other respect & expression of how much we are valued because without us, any company fails. I’m surprised if any single human being read this entire review but I hope it has some sort of positive impact on any individuals reading or on the company… Call back won’t fix this for me, & without any greater action on their part as a company I will never again purchased from them & will give my honest opinion to every single person who asks me about them as a company.
I’m an advocate for creating a world in which every single human enjoys & loves waking up every day to a life filled with love, connection, & the internal understanding & deep rooted knowing of the reality that there’s nothing more valuable then each individual alone (we each are equally as valuable as any other human on this planet). Stand up, speak up, express your vulnerabilities & your strengths openly with as many people as you possibly can because this will have a profound impact. Splashed in a small bite of my philosophy.
So much time with my cellular data to write a review, but zero Internet connection to do my work… NETGEAR, do better, not for the selfish gain of your profits, but for the human beings such as yourself Who like you, valuable & deserve to be taken care of & feel taken care of by those that they trust. I’m sure you’re a massive corporation… Or owned by some other national business conglomerate… The number of you is absolutely not important, what is important is the each of you dedicate your hearts & your lives to treating others as your heart aches for people to treat you. Signing off, I hope you reach out NETGEAR make it up to me as well as any other customer whose experienced such a terrible experience of customer service. I understand fees & charges overtime, I do not except fees & charges I am not informed of at the beginning of my initial purchase being imposed on me when I simply need assistance...
To all of you individuals out there, just like myself & just like every other person but you crossed paths with each & every day, but I know how important you are & how were the you are of everything beautiful in the world & a heart overflowing with joy & fulfillment. Things won’t change unless each one of us changes.
My mini revolution comes in product reviews & through other interesting mediums, but I pray that the planet will be better when I leave & when I got here.",negative

Dont know about longevity.

Definitely reccomend.",positive

The router made my upload speed stay under 100 but the download speed stayed high. I have (1000 download 1000 upload). Tried logging in to the router over 20 times while connected to WiFi and Ethernet. Didn't work every time. Called support they said to factory reset it after I did. It still didn't let me log in. I am able to connect my PC and PS5 via ethernet to the Nighthawk with no issues. I would like to open my ports and/or adjust my router settings but I can not.

There is also the app, which will notify you what device enters your network, you can block specific devices from working on the wifi or joining, you can do a speed test right in the app. And as someone who works in IT, it's nice to be able to change the channel that I am in, view a channel graph to see what channels are being used around me so that you can pick the least cluttered one and not have latency in speeds.",positive

My only thing is the app that you’re supposed to download is super weird. It will reliably report 400+ speeds while Google or Ookla report <100 speeds. I’ve checked it dozens of times, it’s always the same. Very strange. My gut told me that this feels like a scam, as if the product is pretending to be faster than it really is, except that my personal experience of the WiFi is that it is indeed very fast, certainly faster than 100.

That aside, I’d recommend it to anyone. Works well in a two story home with at least a dozen connected devices.",positive

Finally logged on to it from my PC. What I found was a button at the far right bottom of the screen that said ""apply"". This was not visible on my phone without scrolling to the bottom right. The text is small and you need to do a lot of scrolling to find it on a phone. Now it's up and running just fine. 5 stars except for the mobil interface.",positive

It will provide fantastic speeds and will be a nice upgrade for older routers not capable of keeping up with the increasing internet speeds provided today by most ISPs.

Unfortunately, Netgear decided to dramatically change the internal components and then still sell it under the same name (R6700). With that said, Amazon has a little product alert indicating either R6700 or R6700v2. Well, they are shipping the R6700v2 which does not match some of the specifications shown on this page (in particular the CPU speed).

I know because after receiving a router that did not match, they offered to replace it and send the first version of the router (the one with the higher clock speeds as indicated on the actual product details) and ended up receiving the same thing (another V2).

I will say that for those interested in a router that will not be flashed with custom software or that will not use other more advanced functions a router can provide, this is no problem. For those of us that know the hardware and know what we are expecting, that is a problem.

I have it a 3 star because any company that makes an original version with better specs and then turns around and significantly changes this without changing the model number and making minor modifications on the box (see amazon's own photos - both boxes are pictured) simply does not deserve my trust. Speaking of ratings, many of the ratings you see here are lumped up with other Netgear products and also apply to the original more capable version.

I encourage you do your research and check reviews from different sources. This way, you will not be disappointed with the V2 that you will receive. I hope this help you make your decision!",fair

My research said the R6700 was one of the best access points also.

WIRED PERFORMANCE:
-- Ive installed the R6700 router with 4ea D-Link unmanaged 1G switches to reach all the locations in my home and sometimes cascaded the switches and everything works great. (I mention cascading switches because in the past I have had issue when cascading switches but not issues with this setup)
-- BETTER WIRED PERFORMANCE: I have a 8 wireless camera security system that uses its own wireless Network Video Recorder and some of the cameras have poor signal so now switched them over to the wired 1G backbone. A marked improvement in the video update and even the control on the Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ) cameras is instantly responsive
-- GREAT STATUS LIGHTS: The Ethernet port activity lights are great because they have different colors depending on the speed of the network connection. This is really handy when installed a mix of 100M and 1G links so you can tell if things are connected as you planned.

WiFi PERFORMANCE:
-- The Nighthawk replaced a 13 year old wireless router (D-Link 605L) using only a 2.4Ghz wireless network.
-- SAME 2.4G PERFORMANCE: When comparing speeds from my normal laptop wireless location I have not noticed any real improvement in the signal strength nor the connection speed for the old router to the new R6700 at 2.4G.
-- GREAT 5G Performance. When comparing 2.4G to 5G there was typically at 70% improvement in throughput speed from the same laptop.
-- FLEXIBLE CONFIGURATION: Once can turn off the wireless totally or just the 2.4G or the 5G. This is just a nice feature to lower your wireless risk footprint say if you only use 2.4G.

ROUTER CONFIGURATION:
-- EASY SETUP: It was easy to setup the router. In my case I set up the R6700 to match the configuration of the D-link it replaced so I did not have any issues with all the other devices in the house connecting.
-- It went fairly smoothly, but on my laptop I did have to delete the original connection and reconnect to get it to work.
-- VERY SOPHISTICATED: It has some very sophisticated configuration possibilities all of which I will never use.
-- There are 3 levels of configuration with each level allowing more and more complex and detailed setups.
-- I was surprised that to turn off the 5G wireless I had to drill down to the 3rd level to find that config. Seems like that would be a very basic config setting.
-- I really love the display that provides several indicators to give one an instant view of the health and operation of the unit.

COULD BE BETTER:
-- NEEDS MOUNTING TABS: I do wish it had some mechanical mounting capability to secure to a shelf or mount vertically on a wall but its simply a shelf item. With all the cables hanging off the back there is some weight there that wants to pull the Nighthawk off the shelf.
-- STATUS LIGHT ORIENTATION: The status lights are best viewed when looking down on the R6700. When straight its difficult. It would have been better if the lights were mounting at a 45 degree so they could easily be viewed straight on as well.

UPDATE: I purchased a 2nd R6700 and installed in the same network above as an access point. It was easy to set up using a fixed IP and the 5G performance was better than 2X the 2.4G network. And of course the 1G Ethernets are great as I have several security cameras running over the network.",positive
