0,Video Games,Nintendo eShop Gift Card,$5.00 - $99.00,5,I just found out today that the Ultra Pok√©mon versions had just been released recently and wanted to play it right away without having to order the game and wait for it to arrive at my doorstep. I didn‚Äôt want to enter all my new credit card info onto the game console so I decided to go the Amazon route. Buying the ecash gift card allowed me to input the code to add funds in the Nintendo eshop so I was able to purchase the game right from the Nintendo 3ds xl and download it right away. I highly recommend this for people who don‚Äôt want to wait for their Nintendo gift card to arrive in the mail.,positive
1,Video Games,Nintendo eShop Gift Card,$5.00 - $99.00,4,Took me a bit to do just now. I tried putting the codes on my switch and kept denying me. (I got two $5 cards since the $10 wasn't available lol) well anyways fast forward 30 min later lol... I just went on Nintendos website and put it on my account. Checked my switch and boom there was the $10! Now time to figure out if I can use it on my 3ds like Google says üò≠üòÇ,positive
2,Video Games,Nintendo eShop Gift Card,$5.00 - $99.00,5,So far so good. I've never had a problem with e shop cards thru Amazon digital. (Knock on wood) but it seems that stores dont carry $5 cards so gotta go thru an online store. Just took a couple of minutes to get.,positive
3,Video Games,Nintendo eShop Gift Card,$5.00 - $99.00,5,I got a game called cult of the lamb and it‚Äôs been pretty fun. Yes it didn‚Äôt cover the entire cost but I had gift card money on amazon not switch. So‚Ä¶yeah. Worked immediately.,positive
4,Video Games,Nintendo eShop Gift Card,$5.00 - $99.00,5,I get these so my nieces and nephews and I can get the game to you want on the family Nintendo,positive
5,Video Games,Nintendo eShop Gift Card,$5.00 - $99.00,5,"Ok first off if you buy a measly $5 gift shop card your either broke, or you are $1 short from buying the online purchase you were originally trying to buy. Well, for me that was the case because I was like $1 short of buying a game I wanted. Great product, but let me clear up a few things:
1. This is an ONLINE gift-card, meaning the seller won‚Äôt ship a package with the code card in it. (Yes you can buy these e-shop gift cards in stores)
2. Make sure you enter in the right code!!(after you purchase this, click the ‚Äúview item‚Äù and then click a button that says something like ‚Äúgo to my online game purchases‚Äù and to the code should appear.) You‚Äôll scroll down in the reviews and many say that the code doesn‚Äôt work. These are probably the people who accidentally entered in the code next to the real code that says ‚Äúredemption code‚Äù, I forget what the other code is, but I think it‚Äôs your order number or something, NOT your actual redemption code.
To redeem this go on your switch to the e-shop and click on the section that says ‚Äúredeem a code‚Äù then enter it in.
Your welcome, gosh that took a while to type. Anyways hope that helped.",positive
6,Video Games,Nintendo eShop Gift Card,$5.00 - $99.00,5,"Really easy transaction for this gift card. After the purchase, I immediately had an email in my inbox with redemption code.

8,Video Games,Nintendo eShop Gift Card,$5.00 - $99.00,5,"I will never buy another game card at the store again, digital may not necessarily be cheaper but the time and gas I save shopping online, totally worth it. Also the redemption code was available immediately after purchase.",positive

50,Video Games,Xbox Series X,$499.00,4,"Let me get the ugly out of the way first. The industry as a whole completely botched the release of this generation of consoles. Pandemic aside, supply was nowhere near adequate to demand and very likely should have waited until late Winter/early Spring 2021 to launch. Additionally, internet commerce infrastructure was wholly inadequate to handle orders, particularly ones plagued by shopping bots used by scalpers to scoop up the already limited supply and sell them for outrageous markups. Let's hope this was a learning experience for everyone, and measures are being put in place to avoid this from happening in the future. Since this isn't a review of the industry, it won't affect my final score. But it all bore saying nonetheless.

Right then, that out of the way... Despite my September 22 pre-order being delayed delivery by a day, my Series X arrived on November 11. Microsoft did an admirable job with the packaging, and the unboxing felt like an event. Once you broke the transparent seals on the box, the lid lifted like a treasure chest, the XBox nestled in thick packing foam on either side and from the lid above. The console was carefully wrapped in thin black paper-foam with an black and green banner around it that boldly invited you to ""Power Your Dreams!""

Set-up was a breeze. The Series X comes complete with HDMI 2.1 cable for 4K UHD display, power cord (and no ungainly brick this time), and of course the evolutionary Series controller. With everything connected, the first powerup was exciting. The new splash screen is powerful, reminiscent of the old THX sound intro that is truly amazing if you have the volume turned up. Once setup begins in earnest, you can continue either using the controller or by coupling the console with the new XBox app on your phone. I encountered a few issues using the phone app (which is still listed as a beta on the android market), so I continued the setup with the controller. It went without a hitch and plugged all my old XBox One settings in through the miracle of the Cloud. I also plugged in my external HDD, and it happily recognized all my old games.

The user interface is like the return of a familiar old friend. It's very much like the latest iteration on the XBox One family, and you'll be right at home from the very beginning. I know a common complaint is that it didn't seem ""next gen enough"" for many, but there's something to be said for being able to navigate a new device without having to learn all the new nooks and crannies they've shuffled things into. The first thing you'll notice is how fast the UI is now. ""Snappy"" is a term often used to describe how it feels. There's no lag in moving from section to section, button presses register immediately and there's the sense that the whole UI has had a quiet yet unmistakable injection of horsepower. The store, rather than appearing tacked-on and sluggish, comes up post haste. Overall the system is very responsive, and a pleasure to use.

Of course, the system really shines if you have Game Pass. Those new to XBox who take advantage of the Game Pass introductory offer will be treated to over a hundred titles you can immediately download and play. Additionally, EA Play and Microsoft teamed up, so the player has access to dozens more games from the EA library. Sports titles like Madden and FIFA, old school RPG's like the Dragon Age series and much more are at your fingertips. Many titles either already have been enhanced to take advantage of the Series S/X feature set, or are currently being updated for the very same.

Now, all of this is to dance around the very obvious omission in the Series launch: a lack of original and unique launch titles. Halo Infinite was to be that vehicle for Microsoft, but after this Summer's lackluster presentation, the game was delayed until 2021. Its absence is keenly felt in the marketing and product packaging which still prominently features Master Chief as its launch mascot.

That said, the future looks bright indeed for the XBox. Microsoft's manic acquisition of studios, not least of which is the still-pending Zenimax deal, promises some console exclusives that are truly ground-breaking. Between Bethesda's rich legacy in the Elder Scrolls and Fallout, Arkane and id Software, and much more, there is an embarrassment of riches on the horizon for XBox players, as well as PC and mobile gamers who plug into the Game Pass content conduit.

That's all fine and well, but launch exclusives aside, how does it play games? The answer is, ""Quite well, actually!"" Those titles explicitly enhanced to take advantage of the new consoles' power are vibrant, buttery-smooth at 60 (or even 120 in some instances) frames per second, and a joy to both behold and to experience. Even older legacy titles from the original XBox and 360 eras can take advantage of the raw power that the Series brings to bear, with many benefiting from graphical upscaling, auto-HDR, and other behind-the-scenes enhancements. If you've been immersed for years in the XBox culture, you have likely amassed quite the library of games, the vast majority of which are playable on the new hardware.

Finally, the new controller as has been mentioned previously, is more evolutionary than revolutionary. The back of the shell has a textured ""grippy"" new feel to it, as have the shoulder- and trigger buttons. The D-pad now features more of an 8-way control surface rather than the more familiar 4 cardinal directions. The sticks also have a slightly different feel and grip; not so much that it's unfamiliar, but it's noticeable nevertheless. A downside is Microsoft's insistence on not shipping the controller with a rechargeable battery. It takes two ""AA"" cells, and to be fair it's pretty conservative on power draw with a fresh pair of alkalines lasting a good many hours of play. And you can buy the branded recharge kit for an additional $25-ish, but seriously in this day and age, it should come as standard equipment. Luckily, the controller is so similar to the XBox One's controller, that many of the latter's add-ons work perfectly well on the new one. I swapped the recharge pack from my XBO's controller with no issue, and aside from requiring a USB-C cable rather than the older micro-USB connector, it works just fine. The same is true of the headset adapter that plugs into the bottom of the unit. It works without a hitch, which suits me just fine.

OK, final verdict. The Series X is a great powerhouse of a next gen console. While Game Pass is a great deal and I can heartily recommend it, the new consoles are at time of launch a weapon in search of a war. With no new titles to really showcase the new features of the console, the whole experience, while somewhat satisfying, feels a bit hollow. I'm sure once the new titles start flowing in the coming months and years, the true value of the Series consoles will shine forth, but if it's a ""fear of missing out"" experience, I can honestly recommend you wait until availability and new titles can be brought together next year. For that reason, as of the date of writing this (November 22, 2020), I'm reserving one star from the review in the hopes that once those new titles arrive I can revise the review and give the XBox Series X the 5-stars it rightly deserves.

Now if I could only get my hands on a Playstation 5... ugh. *rolls eyes*",positive
51,Video Games,Xbox Series X,$499.00,5,"I now own both the Series X and the PS5 so I will simply say this about the Series X. It is very well built and the design has silent fans and the console heat is channeled through the top making it efficient. What I like is it is not as big as the PS5. The controller feels great. Software design is really good and the system is fast! Smart delivery makes sure you have the best version of game automatically and Gamepass is awesome. What I do not like about it is that it basically feels like the Xbox One X on steroids. The UI is basically the same so it does not have that brand new console feel to it you get with new stuff. All the games have run phenominal. If I had to choose only one console I would pick this Series X over my PS5. The PS5 is HUGE and really ugly in person. Sticks out like a sore thumb, but it performs as well as the series x and better on some games I have noticed. The new controller with the PS5 is really good and with the new UI it really feels like a new console. Both systems are great and well worth the purchase. My advice do not be a fanboy whichever console you find 1st get it you will be happy with it:P Or you can buy both like me if your lucky enough to find them both:P",positive
52,Video Games,Xbox Series X,$499.00,5,"Oh. My. Gosh! This Xbox is faster than I expected it to be, being slightly more inclined to PC gaming for the speed the SSD has over my Xbox One X. This blows my PC rig away.

So far my favorite thing is that I can host my hubby from his computer on to my game on my new Xbox Series X, and he gets to experience the same load times I do. The first game I turned on was Minecraft Dungeons to play with my kids, and my loading time went from around a minute per load to a count of six TOPS.

I was thrilled to see my TV recommend 4K UHD as a display setting, and have been blown away by the quality of the graphics. The controller is comfortable, and noticeably more responsive than my custom Xbox One controller, and my One controllers all easily paired with the Xbox X so I could couch coop with my family without shelling out hundreds on new controllers.

It was definitely worth the money spent if you love a seamless gaming experience. I used to launch a game and then go make a cup of coffee, now I launch a game and nearly instantly play it. I'm excited to try my entire arsenal of games on this rig!",positive
53,Video Games,Xbox Series X,$499.00,4,"So, yeah, new generation of hardware from Microsoft but can I talk about that box? Because that was a spectacular way to jump into the next Xbox.

You open the box up and there is the Series X all wrapped up like it's in a treasure chest. It was great! I actually had to take some video of it because it was above and beyond what I expected from unboxing a new console. So good job on that!

I'm upgrading from an Xbox One S and from that perspective, it was definitely time to upgrade. I've got this 4K TV without a system that properly utilizes it! I held off on getting a One X because I knew the next Xbox system would be coming out soon enough.

And here it is.

Visually speaking, I'm not really noticing TOO much difference from games on the One S. There are some added details on some of my old games to upgrade them to 4K and I notice some effects that weren't there before. Everything is less fuzzy. So that's good. It's just not the same as the visual jump from the NES to the SNES. Or the Playstation to the Playstation 2. But it IS close to the leap from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One. The difference there was only noticeable a few years after the fact for me. I imagine the same will be true here, especially since most of the games I'm playing right not are Xbox One games upgraded to 4K and not native Series X games, beyond Yakuza: Like a Dragon.

And that details the biggest drawback to getting a Series X at launch: lack of a strong exclusive library of games. While the Playstation 5 has Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Godfall, and Sackboy, there isn't anything on the Xbox that can't be played on the PS5 except Yakuza: Like a Dragon (and that can probably be played as a PlayStation 4 game through backwards compatibility). With Halo Infinite being delayed, there's no massive reason to upgrade your hardware.

Well... I SAY that but I also don't regret doing so. I'm disappointed in the lack of exclusives but the 4K is still very nice. And it isn't even the best part of the Series X. That would be the load times. With the new hardware and the new memory storage system, games load incredibly fast. I used to start a game up and then head into the kitchen to grab a drink or whatever while the console booted things up but those days are done. This thing zips along. That also applies while you're in the game. Reloads and fast travels, even cut-scenes, happen swiftly. There's a lot of power in this rectangular box. The Playstation 5 also has super fast load times so it's not a selling feature if you're comparing consoles but, on its own, it presents a compelling case.

It's a lot of the ""under-the-hood"" features that build this system up as a good replacement for your Xbox One. The fact that it is capable of playing a large number of Xbox's back catalog going all the way back to the original Xbox means you'll have a huge library of games to play even if they aren't brand new exclusives. I've got a serious backlog of titles so playing them in 4K and getting into my games faster is fine for me right now. If you are a Gamepass subscriber, you have a large library of games to choose from right out of the gate, including a lot of EA games added from their EA Play subscription service. I spent my first day just downloading everything I'm going to be wasting my time on over the next few months.

And, let me be clear: if you play on Xbox, do yourself a favor and subscribe to Gamepass. You get some great games and many of them are upgraded to take advantage of the Series X. It's a good deal.

I'm happy with my purchase. I wish Halo would have made launch. I'm also happy they held it back so that when it releases, it's worth playing. But, man, launch would have made this purchase a lot more palatable. In the end, it comes down to where your friends are. Mine are on Xbox so here I am. This thing is a powerhouse and I doubt I'm going to regret having it a year or so down the line.

But if you have to make a choice between this and the Playstation 5 and you don't really do online gaming with your friends, the Playstation 5 makes a more compelling case this holiday season. Miles Morales looks really good.

But if Sony's exclusives don't move you, the third party games are all multiplatform. You can enjoy your Call of Dutys and your Assassin's Creeds on whatever console you manage to get. In 2020, I think we could all use a win and I think there's enough to keep you busy on both consoles to check that win box.

Oh! This thing also has a controller! It is pretty much exactly like the Xbox One controller which was a slight upgrade from the 360 controller... which was an upgrade from the Xbox S controller. This is my favorite controller layout and it feels as comfortable in my hands as the XB1 version. There's a capture button now to take pictures and video which is something Sony added with the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo added on the Switch. So Microsoft is a little behind but it's here now! I have not used it yet but I'm sure I'll get around to it.

Anyway, welcome to the next generation of video game hardware. This thing is a beast of tech and should prove a worthwhile purchase. In time. Day one, you know what you're getting: an I.O.U. note promising better things to come.

But, man, that treasure box opening is pretty great. ;)",positive
54,Video Games,Xbox Series X,$499.00,5,"Huge improvement over my one x I actually ended up selling it. This console was very easy to setup out of the box in comparison to the PS5 ( own both). Both consoles are great, I prefer the Xbox controller and like the new design and triggers PS5 controller is just a bit too heavy and I don't prefer the microphone on the controller built in. Xbox is my preferred console, however the PS5 offers a huge amount of free games since I've owned it and they are all very expensive games to buy for the Xbox (grateful I don't need to) Xbox makes up for this with there ""game pass"" but in my opinion the games are not good at all in comparison to what Playstation actually gives you not lets you ""rent"" also the low fee will increase so the people that have game pass will regret it in the long run. Overall happy with the purchase, love the new Halo I only play multi-player and it's actually free wow! I would get xbox live gold card on Amazon its $55 for a year best value, I would skip the game pass that is my opinion especially since I have PS5 free games a huge amount in the two years of ownership. I honestly would buy both consoles if you can afford it with both memberships ( PSN, Xbox Live). Both consoles are backwards compatible and you keep your games how awesome !",positive
55,Video Games,Xbox Series X,$499.00,5,"I started out on the OG Xbox when I was 5 years old cause my dad bought it, he then bought the 360 and I loved that. When PS4 came out however I bought that cause the og Xbone was trash. After a 4 years or so however I had a spat with Sony customer support which if you have dealt with them ever it's awful. Pre-ordered a bunch of games, but then decided to stop gaming in college (stupid decision), they wouldn't let me cancel despite then being pre-orders cause they're policy is trash. I disputed it, they banned account, I created a new one later on my roommate's PS5. Really liked horizon forbidden west not gonna lie. Nothing was actually seriously wrong with the PS4 itself, just Sony was. Xbox one x came out and I just had to buy it. My dad had the og Xbox one, and my word the continual updates to Xbox UI showed, it was fantastic. Then the game pass came out, if you are a playstation camper, let me just say this thing is actually amazing. I'd been falling out of love with gaming honestly, all the AAA games coming out had sucked recently. It felt that I couldn't have fun without spending a lot of money. One of the first games I played on the game pass was Control. Holy crap I missed out on this when it launched, and I never would have discovered it if not for gamepass. I've discovered over 20+ games I never would have bought at full price and am loving it, it made me like gaming again truly. When PS4 and XSX we're announced it felt like PS5 was the Xbox one at launch all over again. Trying take as much money as possible, and not being consumer friendly. Xbox smart delivery (no rebuying games) compared to Sony's pay $10-$20 for upgrade or buy the PS5 version for $60-70 all over again. Like come on, that's BS. All my saves are saved in cloud, I set up my XSX in 10 min, 7 of those was because it was updating. Only thing I had to do was download my games. Yeah launch titles sucked, but Xbox bought Bethesda so that doesnt matter anymore. All first party games are on the game pass day 1. I have not bought a single game since I bought control's XSX version (I could still play Xbox one version on game pass but I wanted to give Ray tracing a go, I had not purchased the Xbox one version though I should note, so this was my first time buying at a gp discount no less). It's fantastic, I'm getting equal or better value than PC (since new games are released on it as well). Everything is just so easy and simple on Xbox compared to PS5. It's like IOS vs the early days of Android (which I now own). Having experienced PS and Xbox, Xbox just has a much more stream lined experience. Also Xbox live crashes like maybe 1/6th (honestly maybe less) of the amount of PSN, like good lord that was actually the most annoying thing ever. The PS5 itself just seems outdated, and Sony seems hostile to the consumer. Honestly this is hands down the best console I have ever owned except maybe the 360 because that was gaming's last golden age imo with COD, halo, GOW, mass effect, too many to name. Overall a just superior product, I do hate Sony after my spat, I fully admit that, but objectively this console is just better. I see nothing but frustration on the PS5. I will miss Horizon, but that's it. So unless you absolutely need God of war or something, like what Halo is (was) to me, buy this. Hell buy this over a PC, I was debating it, but this year and probably next year as well is just bad for getting or building a gaming PC. Seriously buy this console if you are on the fence, if you are debating at all, buy this console. It's xbox's generation this time around, for value, ease of use, as a finished product, and #1...for games and gamers. I debated for weeks which console to buy last generation, but it was simple this time around and I have zero regrets. In the end for the same amount of money you will be able play 2-3x the game you would on PS5, you can play 360 and OG Xbox games as well, for free if you own them already. If you own a gaming PC though, you don't need it.",positive
56,Video Games,Xbox Series X,$499.00,5,"I have been a gammer all my life, have owned almost every console since the Atari Pong all the way till the Ps4 and Switch, but I have skipped most Xbox' s except for the original that was given to me as a gift.
This new console that Microsoft has made is in my opinion the absolute best in this generation. Spec-wise it cannot be beat and if superior to the PS5 I most respects. But when you use your series X and in conjunction with Game Pass Ultimate (GPU), it simply becomes the hands down, no questions asked, absolute BEST VALUE in gaming anywhere! Today Microsoft has also teamed up their GPU service with EA, and now we can get most sports games and most EA titles included in GPU. But you must also add the future inclusion of Bethesda and all their amazing titles from day one in GUP since MS has bought them out.
So how can't you go wrong with the MOST POWERFUL CONSOLE EVER MADE and the potential of including GPU to make it the best value in gaming PERIOD.

Yes some will think that their are few titles specifically made for this new generation as of this writing, but the same goes for Playstation, and Sony changed their mind in the short term, as most titles that they have as great exclusives are also being released for the foreseeable future on PS4 as well as PS5.

PROS:
- Best Value in gaming when used with Game Pass Ultimate.
- Most powerful console ever made (12TFLOPS - 52 CU's).
- Intuitive and very functional OS.
- Great games even for this generation like: Medium.
- FPS Boos feature for older games.
- Automatic HDR for older games.
- Instant Resume feature is just awesome!
- Great controls, I thought I would not like them, BUT THEY ARE GREAT!
- Minimalistic design, that goes well with anything you have already.
- QUIET there is no noticeable sound of fans even when gaming for hours.
- More available space in internal drive then PS5.

CONS:
- Controllers use a AA Battery... WHY would you do this in 2021? Yes there are options, but I should not need to look for options, personally for now I went the rechargeable Energizer route, but it is a hassle that should not be present in a console this generation.
- No gimmicks and straightforward pure power, no you don't get resistance in the adaptive triggers like a PS5, makes it feel a bit less futuristic.
- Had a bug happen to me more then once while purchasing new games, got an error, so for workaround had to add to cart, go to billing address, put edit, select the same billing address and then it worked, very annoying.

SPECS:
- Processor: 8-core AMD Ryzen Zen 2-architecture CPU at 3.8GHz (3.6GHz with SMT)
- Graphics: AMD Navi/RDNA 2-family GPU with 52 CU at 1.825GHz (12TFLOPS FP32)
- Video:16GB GDDR6 with 14Gbps 320-bit interface (10GB at 560GB/s allocated to GPU, 6GB at 336GB/s allocated to rest of system with 3.5GB for GPU)
- Die Size: 360.45 mm2
- Process: 7nm Enhanced
- Memory: 16 GB GDDR6 w/ 320mb bus
- Memory Bandwidth: 10 GB @ 560 GB/s, 6GB @ 336 GB/s
- Internal Storage: 1 TB Custom NVME SSD
- I/O Throughput: 2.4 GB/s (Raw), 4.8 GB/s (Compressed, with custom hardware decompression block)
- Expandable Storage: 1 TB Expansion Card - Seagate ATM only avail.
- External Storage: USB 3.2 External HDD - WB Black Gaming 5TB what I got for it.
- Optical Drive: 4K UHD Blu-Ray Drive-
- Performance: 4K @ 60 FPS, up to 4K @ 120 FPS, 8K @ 60 FPS
- Size: 301mm x 151mm x 151mm

Finally, I will recommend this console over the the PS5, its simply a BEAST and a better value when teamed with GPU. I won't get a Ps5 for the foreseeable future at least not till late 2022, since by then they might really have PS5 exclusives that don't get. a PS4 version.
The Xbox Series X is such a great console that you would be hard pressed to look it over over the hype that the Ps5 has generated because of its lack of availability. So if you like simply the best console this generation and wish to get the best bang for your buck, Xbox Series X simply rocks.

PRO+ : The Xbox series X is also an amazing emulation system, it can run Retroarch with no hacks, with nothing weird, just look it up in YouTube and you will find tutorials. But it can do emulation like very few systems and it add to its tremendous lineup and value.

This was the whole reason why I was scared to move to console instead of sticking with PC all they do is make consoles left and right and they're all junk and that's what they want because they want to take your money and run with it when their are alot issues ....save yourself $500 pick yourself up an old xbox one and it runs about the same a little bit tiny bit slower and and way more cheaper oh wait no it's not it's pretty much the same price which is my issue

It's like the Call of Duty's producer in the call of duty every 4 to 6 months reminds me of the same thing with the xbox they make the game so fast there's issues and bugs and they don't care they just move on and it's the same thing with these xbox as it seems",fair

72,Video Games,Xbox Core Wireless Controller ‚Äì Carbon Black,$49.00,5,"Okay, let me start by saying that I too was not sure if this wireless controller would work without a USB dongle on windows 10. I did NOT buy the USB dongle version.
If you're wanting a Bluetooth controller please make sure you have Bluetooth in your computer. 99% of the time you have Bluetooth with a wifi card or wifi on a m.2 card. If you don't have either, you probably don't have a Bluetooth connection.
I have a wifi card, so I have bluetooth..
So assuming you have all of these things (bluetooth connection) all you simply have to do is turn on the controller, hold down the sync button and windows will ask if you would like to pair the controller.

74,Video Games,Xbox Core Wireless Controller ‚Äì Carbon Black,$49.00,5,"Although there's been a lot of buzz (and rightfully so) around the new Dualsense PS5 controller, Microsoft decided to take a very different approach from Sony; meaningful, iterative improvements to an already solid base. The first version I ever used, model 1697, was the best controller I had ever used up to that point. It was the primary reason I switched from my XB360, as I was unable to pair it with the console, but the controller was too good to go back. Clicky, responsive buttons, lighter weight, easily accessible battery door, good battery life, solid accuracy and excellent haptic feedback in the triggers made me fall in love. Jump to the next model, the 1708, and all those things remained, but there was a different finish and now the awesome addition of Bluetooth. This has been the controller I've used on console and PC for the better part of 5 straight years. I've even tried to pair it with a couple Sony systems to experience some of the better games exclusive to that platform (I was unsuccessful BTW). Now, introduce this model, the 1914, and I feel like it's 2 steps forward and a step backwards. The D-Pad is outrageously good and responsive, the trigger texturing gives a more involved feel, the matte finish makes it less vulnerable to oils or greases making it slippery and the battery door redesign is a very slight but meaningful touch. Even the added feature of showing the battery level on PC is a tiny detail that shows the thoughtfulness that went into crafting this. The only reason this is not a 5 is the connectivity. Full disclosure, this is primarily used with a PC in this use case, and as such, you WILL need the XBox accessories app, as I needed to apply an update fresh out the box. The Bluetooth connection on my 1708 literally never dropped out in my entire memory of use. Extremely strong, very dependable and no lag to speak of. The 1914, not so much. There's been no observable lag, and when it works, it's easily better, but the connection is very spotty. As mentioned, an update was necessary right out of the box, and performance marginally improved, but as it stands, during a 3 hr play session last night it lost connection at least 10 times, with the Xbox light blinking a few times and going solid again roughly every 20 mins or so. I tried multiple games, including very tight shooters and it's the same thing; excellent performance when it's working, a temporary drop for no more than 5 seconds, then back to working as if nothing happened. I've already gone the driver route of making sure everything is updated correctly, but this seems to be more a 1914 problem, as the 1708 has never had this problem with a console or 3 different PCs with 3 different Bluetooth adapters. Funny though, a wireless adapter is available, and is touted as the primary way to connect without a USB cable (the USB cable does work flawlessly BTW). Of course, there is a fee for this adapter, which makes me feel like this is the classic create a problem, sell the solution sort of scenario, which has soured my experience greatly here. This is a relatively new device, having only been on the market for a little over a month at the time of this writing, so it's definitely possible for this issue to be resolved, but there's currently no discount for this unit, so you're being asked the complete price for an incomplete experience for the time being. Once (if) this issue is resolved, I will absolutely change this to a 5, but right now, with the drops, it's a mediocre purchase at best, with the 1708 currently being a better option, and at a lesser price. Best of luck.

Edit: In order to have the update applied, you must FIRST connect to the PC with your USB-C and use the Xbox accessories app to update, then, most importantly, you must UNPAIR the controller if it was previously paired. If it's the first time pairing, it won't be an issue, but if you previously were paired before the update, it will not apply. After following these steps, I can confidently report all connection issues have been fixed, and there have been no Bluetooth drops to speak of. This is now a 5 star device.",positive

76,Video Games,Xbox Core Wireless Controller ‚Äì Carbon Black,$49.00,4,"First off, controller's fine. Feels hefty, but not too heavy. Comfortable to hold and the color itself is lovely. I'm overall happy I finally upgraded from my old XBOX 360 controller on my PC.

All that being said:
-It doesn't come with a chargeable battery
-Even if you buy a rechargeable battery there's no way to tell on the normal controller how charged it is unless you're using the PC's XBOX app (some 3rd party batteries do try to negate this)
-Trying to use bluetooth on my PC was really spotty for me (I tried multiple dongles and updated the controller firmware etc, but clearly not everyone is having this problem)
-To actually get wireless connectivity to my PC I also had to buy another freaking device

So, let's tally this up (at the time of my purchase at least):
XBOX Controller: $60
Rechargeable Battery: $22
XBOX Wireless Dongle: $28
Total: $110

It *is* a good controller, but know that depending on what you want, it may be more expensive then you initially think. Wireless thankfully does work fine when using the XBOX Dongle, so if you are having trouble with bluetooth it's a good option to try.",positive
77,Video Games,Xbox Core Wireless Controller ‚Äì Carbon Black,$49.00,5,"Ever find yourself searching for your controller? This one asserts itself from across the room. If you spend more than a few seconds looking for it, it's probably in another room, possibly another building.

However, the colour coding of the buttons is lost so if that's relevant to your accomplishing QTE's, expect an adjustment period. There's a legend between the buttons that shows what colour the buttons usually are, but that's not something you're likely to read with peripheral vision the way you might a classic X-box colourway.

The worst thing about it though, is a flaw I believe is common to this generation of controllers. I find I have to turn off rumble feedback, as well as take extra care when putting the controller down because I'm using it wired to my PC. When any pressure is placed on the USB C port the controller loses connection and the cable has to be unplugged from the controller and reseated to re-establish connection. This loss occurs from setting the controller down on a table, and can happen from rumble feedback. If you're using it wireless you might not experience this issue.",positive

112,Video Games,"BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset for PS4 PC Xbox One PS5 Controller, Noise Cancelling Over Ear Headphones with Mic, LED Light, Bass Surround, Soft Memory Earmuffs for Laptop Mac Nintendo NES Games",$23.99,5,"This is specifically for the Green and Black Bengoo G9000 professional gaming headset.

The quality of this headset for the price is near unbeatable. Headset feels very durable/kid proof. It‚Äôs made of ABS plastic with metal inserts on the adjustable band. The ear cushions on these are pleather pillow cushions and they are extremely comfortable. I have an absolutely huge head, and these fit just right. The ear cups fit over my ears entirely and they do a decent job of blocking out ambient sound.

The headset is very light weight, making it very comfortable to use for long play sessions. I had no ear or head pain from wearing these for extended periods of time.

The integrated volume control and mute switch work very well. The cord is extra long (8ft) and it‚Äôs braided the entire way. This cord feels pretty premium and even has a Velcro cord wrap on it.

It comes with a PC Splitter just in case you have a setup like that. The USB only powers the LED lights, and they are very green. Therefore, the USB does not have to be plugged in, but is a nice touch if you‚Äôre into that sort of thing. Personally I really like the lights and think they are nice, but I don‚Äôt use them every time either.

Microphone quality is very good and the noise canceling system seems to work extremely well on it. Only time echo was noticed was when volume was at 100% and even then, it was not bad at all. I went through numerous $70-$100 headsets in the last three weeks trying to find a microphone that didn‚Äôt echo all my friends‚Äô voices back at the slightest sound of speech. Seriously, it was pathetic how garbage the microphones are on the expensive Hyper X and Nacon Rig headsets.

Sound quality is superb for the price point. These are pretty bass heavy if you like that sort of thing. Very reminiscent of Skullcandy sound quality. I like this type of sound myself, because in a shooter you literally feel the bass with this headset. Highs are also good if not a little less pronounced, and I had no problem hearing footsteps in shooters. In games like fortnite that‚Äôs exactly what you want.

These also sound very well with directional 3D audio like Dolby Atmos. So I definitely recommend these for surround sound gaming as well.

My one minor complaint is that the cord for the USB is not long enough and it did not come with an extender. That‚Äôs a small price to pay though considering everything else is so good about these headphones.

I‚Äôm now own multiple Bengoo products. This is a brand I trust in. Not only are they a quality brand, but their customer service is absolutely excellent. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to buy this brand for any of your audio needs.",positive

There is no noise cancelation. The loudest volume is not that loud to be honest. The LED lights needs the USB to be plugged in which is on the wire next to the plug you would put into your controller. You can use it for Playstation or Xbox but you can't use LED unless you have some sort of attachment on your controller with a USB port. I guess I should have expected this since it wasn't too expensive although for this product I think the price is a lot. This is equivalent to a 15 dollar headset based on sound quality, no noise cancelation and the LED lights not being able to be plugged in especially if you're playing on Playstation.",positive

The company did reach out to me to tell me they are getting a new supplier. Maybe the mic will work better for future customers. They offered a replacement/refund as well, but I have already purchased a new headset that works a lot better. They also tried to talk me into deleting the below review, but it was my honest experience with the headset that I received.

*Original Review*
This worked well for a very short while, but now the microphone is way too quiet and nobody can hear me (in Discord). The sound quality through the headphones is still good, but I can't use it to game with other people because they can't hear me. It's such a shame. It also doesn't have an option to use the laptop's microphone instead of the headset, so I can't just use it for the headphones.",positive
122,Video Games,Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Nintendo Switch,$43.99,5,"This is the definitive edition version of Mario Kart 8, and a must buy for those who never owned the Wii U version. For those who already own the Wii U version, the changes may or not be worth it depending on what you're looking for. Without further ado here are the list of changes compared to the Wii U version:

1. 1080p with higher frame rate* when docked (TV mode) instead of 720p (on Wii U). Tabletop mode it's still 720p. Frame rate TV mode is 60fps, off TV mode is 59fps. Yes, one frame makes a difference when comparing side-by-side and/or when you have been playing dozens of hours of the original

2. 5 new characters: King Boo, Bowser Jr, Dry Bones, & Inklings (Boy and Girl)

3. Characters can now carry up to two items at once, even if they don't drag the first item

4. Double Item Box. Get two items when you run through a double item box or two singles. Note that you cannot swap items back and forth

5. ""Smart Steering"" A mode that prevents you from running off course or into a puddle of water. Good for toddlers or young children getting into the game (especially on the rainbow road courses). If the Smart Steering mode is on, the player's vehicle will have an antenna sticking out its rear end. The antenna blinks when Smart Steering is active.

6. ""Auto-accelerate"" for beginners. Can be used in conjunction with Smart Steering, essentially you don't have to hold down the accelerate button. Again, good for young children who just want to drive through the track without any stop-gaps. Works well when using the wheel peripheral

7. All DLC (from Wii U) included. Everything is unlocked from beginning except kart parts and Gold Mario. Kart Parts are unlocked by playing through the game and collecting coins. Gold Mario unlocked by winning all of the 200cc grand prix cup

8. Time Trials in the 200cc engine class have been added. Also added are new ghosts of Nintendo employees to race against

9. Ultra Mini-Turbo, denoted by pink/purple sparks that appear after the orange sparks which makes you boost significantly faster. Cannot be used with smart steering on

10. Online Play.
-Option to change character and vehicle combinations during an online lobby without having to leave/exit out; this is done by pressing the ""Y"" button during the course selection screen of an online lobby.

- You can see what lap everyone is in, in spectator mode if you finish early

-When you win a match you get to wear a crown in the main online menu screen for everyone in the lobby to see. Hat also present when you're in the lead during a match

- More icon packs for tournament mode

11. Faster loading times. Just a few seconds, but it adds up overtime. If you purchase Mario Kart Deluxe digital over the physical you get 1-2 secs off each track loading screen

12. New amiibo compatibility. You now get racing suits when scanning in specific amiibo

13. Boo and feather (battle mode only) item return to the game

14. You get the same 48 courses racing courses. But you get 5 additional new battle stages in battle mode + 3 retro stages

15. The Villager in now split between male and female selectable characters with different stats bringing the roster to the total of 42 characters (excluding character variants. Example: different color yoshis/shy guys, create your own mii, etc)

16. Graphical change: Motion Blur, High Quality Shadows, Confetti now drop to the ground showing animation at start of match

17. Battle mode: Biggest change in terms of gameplay. There are 4 battle mode game types:

-Balloon Battle. Traditional Arena Style (no more battling in a circle) Mario Kart Battle mode where you use items to pop your opponent's balloons or steal them via feather item in order to score points.

-Renegade Round Up. Cops and Robbers style setup. One team with the potted piranha plants try to capture all the other team before time runs out. Once captured your teammate can also free you from your jail cell

-Bob-omb Blast. Same as balloon battle, but you only carry bombs

-Coin Runner. Collect as many coins in the stage as you can before time runs out

-Shine Thief. A keepway style game where you have to hold the Shrine Sprite the longest before time runs out. The driver holding the shrine sprite will have their speed lower the longer they hold it

==Additional notes:
- There's 4 player split screen in docked (TV mode) and handheld/table top mode. Note that the screen for table top mode is really small and may be a problem for those who are far-sighted. When playing 2 player it's 60fps, 3 or more on the same screen it'll drops down 30fps

-There's no Download Play, so you have to play split screen or have another copy of the game if you don't want to share the same screen or play more than 4 players

-Stamps do not make a return since the Switch doesn't have miiverse

-No more gamepad/duel screen when playing TV mode, so this time around you cannot see what items everyone is holding by glancing down

-No voice chat (as of this review) unfortunately. Was present in the Wii U version with mic hardware (which no one bought). There's supposed to be a smart phone app that takes advantage of voice chat, but no word yet from Nintendo

-Statistics of the vehicle parts and drivers have also been changed to make game more balanced

-Other balance changes:
Fire Hopping have been removed: An exploit in the Wii U version where you can repeatedly hop from left to right to get extra speed from turboboost.

Blue shell dodge exploit still present. It's when you fall off the cliff the last second the blue shell is about to hit you, it'll save a lot of time recovering from the hit. Note this cannot be done when smart steering mode is on

If a Blooper is about to ink the player as they cross the finish line, the player will still get inked.

Red Shell Nerfed: If you're holding an item behind you while in the air, you can block a red shell

Easier to break while drifting (advanced tactic)

-Luigi still has his signature death stare

If there's anything I missed please put it in the comments.

Overall, i personally think the best additions are the enhanced battle mode and the portability aspect as I can now play during my break period and commute to work. I already sunk in over 300+ hours on the Wii U version and the upgrade is totally worth it for me as I got more than my money's worth in the original game on Wii U and plan to sync 300+ on the Switch version especially with the ease of use due to it's portability, and 100+ more hours of play in battle mode play with housemates. Well that is my personal perspective, so if you are in a similar situation it's a very good buy. If not, I hope the list of changes helped you in your purchasing decision",positive
123,Video Games,Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Nintendo Switch,$43.99,5,"Listen, if you've ever played a Mario Kart game then you know what you're getting into. It's Mario Kart, but it looks better than ever. It includes the 4 cups from the original game's DLC, bringing the total tracks available to 48. Nintendo is also releasing a $25 DLC that is adding an additional 48 tracks, doubling the base game's size. It's a bargain.

If you enjoyed unlocking characters, I have some bad news for you--they're all unlocked from the start. The only secret character is Gold Mario, which you can get from getting a gold trophy in all the 200cc grand prix. And the 200cc is available right when you boot up the game for the first time. Kind of a letdown if you like unlockables. Kart options unlock as you collect more coins through gameplay. This maxes at 5000 coins and gives you a golden glider. If you beat the 150cc and Mirror Mode (available as soon as you boot up the game for the first time) you get a golden kart. If you beat the staff ghosts in the 150cc time trials you get golden wheels.

I was skeptical at first, but listen... it's Mario Kart. It's just fun. You won't regret buying it.",positive

So after doing some research what I have found is that if you currently have a payment plan active such as game pass ultimate it will automatically convert that 12 month card to 4 months of game pass ultimate to keep your current plan going. I've had game pass ultimate before very briefly and it still gave me gold. So from what I understand, this works just fine as long as your current payment plan has expired. Hopefully this helps and hopefully it works just fine for anybody else who buys this because I'm sure no one else wants to pay $40 to $60 more a year for gold.",positive

162,Video Games,"HyperX Cloud II - Gaming Headset, 7.1 Surround Sound, Memory Foam Ear Pads, Durable Aluminum Frame, Detachable Microphone, Works with PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One ‚Äì Red",$50.78,5,"UPDATE (03/16/17): I ended up giving my pair of Cloud II's to my son for his birthday. I now had to make a decision whether to purchase another pair of Cloud II's or try something else. SO, I ended up buying the Beyerdynamic DT770, Logitech G633, Turtle Beach Stealth 500P and the Playstation Golds. I bought all four from Amazon and sat down and tested all of them over a period of 4 months. First off, what I love in headphones is a full sounding, deep bass and some ambient surround sound. I like hearing the boom of a grenade or thump of a stealth take-down of a long-neck in Horizon Zero Dawn.

First off, Don't believe in the 7.1 surround sound hype you get from any ""GAMING"" headphones under $200. I have now tried 3 different actual gaming headsets and all of them gave the directional sound but at a cost... These gaming headphones that declare 7.1 surround achieve this by diminishing the sound levels of other ambient sounds. I'm not a audiophile or pro so bare with me... The Logitech G633, Turtle Beach Stealth 500P and the Playstation Golds all sounded tinny and the mid-range seemed distant. It hyped up the surround but in order to achieve that it lowered the other sounds to make it happen, including bass. For example, in Horizon Zero Dawn, when Aloy shoots an arrow it sounds like it's far away, when it shouldn't because she's directly in front of you and if you shot off that arrow it should sound like the release happened in your face. It doesn't. It sounds like your Aloy let go of the bow about 20 yards from where you are standing. If that makes sense. YES, the gaming headphones with 7.1 do give you directional but it just lowers everything else. Which is why I assume pro gamers love them because they want to hear if someone is sneaking up on them.

FOR ME though... I'm not a pro gamer. I want bass, a thud. I want a overall strong sound that makes me feel like I'm right there. SO, I did more research online and youtube and came across the Beyerdynamic DT770's. They are not gaming headphones but many claim the bass is awesome and the sound in games is even better. I just received these today and within 30 minutes I packaged them back up and returning them. Although, I will give them this much. The directional sound was WAY better than any gaming headphones, Logitech G633, Turtle Beach Stealth 500P and the Playstation Golds. No joke, the directional sound was dead on with these. The low bass was also good but wasn't enough and the mid-range sounded distant just like the Logitech G633, Turtle Beach Stealth 500P and the Playstation Golds. If you want directional sound that mimicks 7.1, with a low bass that isn't overwhelming I would buy the Beyerdynamic's.

SO saying all of that. I know this sounds funny but I'm basing this all down to shooting an arrow. I switched back and forth between the Beyer's and the Clouds II's in Horizon Zero Dawn. I would shoot an arrow at a grazer (metal animal) and the Cloud II's sounded like I shot that arrow from my shoulder next to my ear. It also enough bass to where you felt like you actually shot an arrow. The Beyer's and the Logitech G633, Turtle Beach Stealth 500P and the Playstation Golds all felt Aloy (character in game) was 20 yards away shooting an arrow. Only way I know how to describe it. The Cloud II's also have way more base then the one's I've mentioned. It's punchy and you feel it. Felt good when I slammed the ground with my spear. The Logitech G633, Turtle Beach Stealth 500P and the Playstation Golds and Beyer all felt weak. When I slammed the ground with my spear it again, felt distant. Not really immersive.

I stood on top of a Long Neck. When a Long Neck walks around the map it's feet create a ground thump that should sound heavy. SO I stood on top of a Long Neck and switched back and forth between the Beyer and Cloud II's. The Beyer again felt like the sounds were distant and didn't feel the Long Neck walking very much. The Cloud II's at the same sound level I could feel the Long Neck walking, it felt like I was right there on top of the Long Neck and could feel every step it took.

Also, the Cloud II's do have directional sound ... So if you walk up to someone talking and swing your camera around in a 360, the voice will swing around your head as it should. Is it true surround, no. Does it do the trick, yet. Now in the Beyer and Logitech G633, Turtle Beach Stealth 500P and the Playstation Golds, the surround does sound more ambient and sounds around you but again, it diminishes the bass and mid-range it feels like.

So saying all that, I'm a casual gamer that wants good bass, I want to feel like I get hit rather than hear someone walking up behind me. I want to feel the game. The Cloud II's in my opinion after trying all the headphones are awesome. I can honestly say that and feel comfortable suggesting you pick up a pair over any other's I've suggested. They really are good.

I can also attest to the 7.1 feature the Cloud II's do provide with the packaging. You can plug it into your PS4 and your controller and I can honestly say it does provide 7.1 BUT it then turns into the Beyer and Logitech G633, Turtle Beach Stealth 500P and the Playstation Golds and diminishes the mid-range and bass.

I don't plug my Cloud II's into my controller. I purchased a two speaker with sub-woofer sound system for my desk that comes with a volume control and headphone output. I plug my Cloud II's into this setup which allows me to turn it up as loud as I want and in a way acts as a amp to push out even more bass and volume. You can't get that by just plugging into the PS4 controller, it can only pump out so much volume and your maxed out. Not very loud going directly through the controller.

By a desktop sound system with subwoofer and volume control with headphone output.... Trust me it changes the sound output and bass levels.

SO there's my updated review. Other's will probably disagree with my review but this is COMING from someone who doesn't need 7.1 or games heavily online in COD or Battlefield 1. I love games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Last of Us, Dying Light, Metal Gear Solid 5, Just Cause 3, Nioh, Dark Souls, BloodBorne, Evil Within, Dishonored, etc. I should also mention I've also owned the X12's, PX24's.

Previous Review: OKAY, SO FINALLY, after buying the X12, PX24, TB 500p, Sony Gold Wireless and returning all of them, I purchased the Cloud II. Before I bought the Cloud II, I was almost going to settle with the X12's or PX24. The 500p and Gold Wireless you'd think are superior BUT THEY ARE NOT. The surround sound on the expensive gamer headphones are just a gimick. Most of the surround sound gamer headphones are made for gamers who primarily play FPS. It tones down quite a few sounds including bass and other environmental sounds to pump up footsteps and reloads. This allows the FPS gamer to hear what's around him. Sounds cool, YEA BUT, again, it drowns out other sounds to make that possible.

Saying that, I'm a casual gamer and I love bass. I love feeling the thump of the explosions and gun fire. The 500p and Gold Wireless sucked at this. IN fact, the 500p did have good bass but ONLY when I switched it to the mode called, ""Bass & Treble"". Great right? NO, because that's basically what the X12's and PX24's do. Even the x12's simulate surround sound. I've had a pair of x12's for 5 years and I can honestly say they simulated surround just as good as the 500p and Gold's but kept the bass and overall depth of sound. More balanced.

This is where the Cloud II comes in... Very skeptical and was almost ready to return them before I got them. Was just tired of buying and returning. Before I begin, a few disclaimers... 1. I game on a PS4 and I don't plug my headphones into my controller or through USB. I actually bought a device online that allows me to plug in my toslink directly from the output on the PS4 to the adapter which is where I plug my headphones into. This gives it way more depth and power then plugging into the controller or via USB on the front of the console.

2. The 7.1 on this particular headset doesn't really work with PS4. Saying that, it actually works but doesn't. Bare with me on this... In order to get it to work, you have to plug it into the front of the PS4 via a USB. Then you plug the headset into the 7.1 mixer. I tried it with and without and quite honestly it sound MUCH better without the 7.1. Mainly because the 7.1 mixer is designed for PC and MAC. It wasn't designed to use with the PS4 even though you can get it to turn on. SO, I actually don't use the 7.1 mixer. I put it back in the box.

3. DONT plug the headset into your controller or via the USB. A lot of people don't realize they can buy a very cheap setup that allows you to use the toslink which pumps out the 7.1. I'll do my best to link my set up below. I've been using it for years and won't go back. Only because when I plug these into the controller it loses something, can't put a finger on it but it doesn't sound as good. Same with using the mixer.

I highly recommend the Cloud II. It has really good deep base, the mid's are clear and sharp and the high's as well. It's a very well balanced sound, as well as, it does simulate surround sound even without the 7.1. I switched back and forth between the Gold's and these while playing NO Man's Sky, Dying Light, Dark Souls 3, BloodBorne, Just Cause 3 and these really sounded good and very good balance of sound.

Best part, I own a Nvidia Shield and plug the headset into the controller that comes with the shield and watched a couple movies with it and it blew me away. Awesome sound and even simulated surround sound.

FINALLY satisfied with a headphone purchase after using my x12's for 5 years. Both my sons are sold on them as well comparing them to other headsets they've owned. Worth the purchase in my opinion.

OH, they are comfortable!!! Although, be aware... It comes with a leather or fake leather material and it comes with a replacement that is cloth. I noticed a huge difference in sound when I used the leather over the cloth. Mainly because the leather is air tight and keeps all the sound in and out. The cloth I noticed I could hear outside sound more and it leaked the sound coming from the headphones. Wasn't a big deal but the bass felt deeper and stronger with the leather padding. Both are awesome and sound good though.

USE THIS DEVICE to hook up your headphones using the Toslink output on the PS4. I've used these for the past 3-5 years and they work great and pump out way better sound then plugging into the controller or using the USB on the front of the PS4. A lot of people don't realize you can use this with any headphones whether they are made for Xbox or PS4 or PC. It's makes it to where you can use any headphone and uses the Dolby surround from Toslink.

Whenever I use those programs, and sound plays on the PC with the headset plugged into it, it seems to bypass the headset and sound comes to my PC accessing the remote PC. Going back to my PC with the headset plugged in (and closing CRD and TV completely), that is when no sound comes out and I have to unplug the USB control box and plug it back in for it to start giving sound. I do not intend to stop using either of those programs, so unless I find a fix, I am OK with having to do this. I will not knock a few points from this headset that I already think is an awesome product; as it is an issue with a program and not the headset itself and as such I will change my rating from 4 *'s to 5 *'s. These have also been great for long periods of gaming and streaming. No headaches or sore spots on my head from wearing these, even with glasses on. My voice from my stream and recordings sound great, and playing Alien: Isolation is truly a terrifying thing when these are cranking up the noises and you hear metal clanking from the alien like it is right there above you! Things sound crisp and clear to me, like voices, even in movies and YouTube videos. END EDIT

I bought these several weeks ago from Amazon Warehouse, thought I would save $5. I know $5 might not seem that much, but having just spent $1400 on new PC parts for my build, every dollar counts! Anyway, I am new to PC gaming, been with consoles for years. I wanted to find a good headset that would give me good sound, good mic, good fit, good build quality, and cheap. I found these actually by accident, as I was searching for Logitech's headset, initially.

Now, these things are awesome... (The following is updated with my edit above) When they function, which to be honest is quite often. However, sometimes when I go to use these, they sometimes stop outputting sound. I go into my playback devices and I see that it is registering them active and that sound is being transmitted, except nothing comes out of the speakers. I have to unplug the USB control box from my PC and plug it back in for them to get back to working. I also have quite a bit of trouble getting these to work consistently with my HTC M8 (more so than with my PC). I sometimes have to reset my phone for these to work and I am not sure why that is. I am not sure if it is these that are just not very compatible, as I have earbuds that work every single time. That leads me to believe that these are defective in some way. It could be that by trying to save $5, these may have just been defective from the start.

The mic is pretty good too. I like that it is detachable and flexible enough to get out of the way if I need it to be. You can hear yourself when you speak, you just need to make sure that, in your recording devices, you set it to listen. I really don't like this though. There is quite a big delay (maybe around 1/2 second) in you talking to hearing yourself from the speakers. The first time I tried this, I gave myself a headache. Just try to talk, expecting to hear your voice, and as you are saying one thing you are hearing what you just said, it gets very confusing for the senses! My speech became confusing, something my brain couldn't reconcile, which led to my headache (yes, an actual headache!). I am not sure if this is something that is expected when you have to do this, but I would not recommend doing this (of course, your experience may vary). There is a little rubber piece that goes over the exposed port of the mic when you detach it, from the headset, that I see being lost quite quickly. It is a nice touch to be able to cover that port, I just wish that it could have somehow been kept on the headset, so it wouldn't get lost. I still do have mine, and I keep it in the bag that comes with this headset (more on that below) so maybe I just need to keep it there unless I use these on a trip or something.

The fit on these things are one of the best things about this. Very snug, very comfortable and when I have my glasses on, they don't press those into my head. You can either use the leather ones or the velour. I prefer the velour, they just feel very cozy and warm and plush!

The build of these things, to me, do not seem to equate to a $100 price tag. That is a good thing, as these things feel like I am stealing something from Kingston! I would honestly expect to pay quite a bit more for how well these things are built. 'How can Kingston sell these for what I paid?' I keep asking myself every time I put them on! They are built with metal along the top, padded underneath to rest comfortably on your head. With several hours of gaming, they don't feel heavy on my head. The stitching in these things is fantastic, it is a nice detail, that while it may not improve the functionality, it just proves my reasoning of thinking I am stealing something from this company, but I am glad I am not! The cord quality is great, it is braided so it doesn't tangle or get easily caught on something. The cord is standard length, from the headset to the end, which can plug into many things to be used for listening. However, it is short for having it just plugged into your PC (this is not using the USB control box). If you do use the control box, which I recommend, then it adds a lot of length, letting you sit quite a distance from your machine. The control box has a clip on the back that allows you to attach it to your pants pocket, shirt, anything else, really. This is nice cos now I don't have to figure out where my controls are when I quickly need to mute, decrease/increase volume/mic, enable/disable 7.1 virtual. So with these things not functioning properly for me at times, I am not sure if it is the control box, or the headset in general (like I said earlier, I have problems getting this to work properly on my phone too. This could all be due to the fact that I ordered from Amazon Warehouse instead of brand new). I need the control box to add the extra length as my PC sits farther away than some might have theirs. The carry bag that comes with this looks to be great quality too. I expect to use it for the first time in a couple days when I go on a trip and bring these along. It is large for these to fit and keep everything that comes with it, all in one space.

Now onto the 7.1. I cannot comment on how well this works. Let me give you some background information. I have a hearing disability. 95% of my left ear is not working and I need a hearing aid in my right ear, which is around 70% deaf. I use these things with and without my hearing aid. I cannot use the functionality of the 7.1, which is not that big of a deal for me as I have come to terms with not being able to hear very well in general. It does, however, seem to increase the volume, which sometimes I need when I listen to movies or TV shows on my PC. So read what others have to say about that, I'm sorry I cannot do this in this review. I will say though that these things can get LOUD. Which is why sometimes I use these without my hearing aid. They really do deliver a lot of sound to my ear that works. There is an audible tone when you push the controls and it is different when you reach the max and minimum. This is a nice touch as well.

Finally. I am writing this review for the product I purchased from Amazon Warehouse a couple of weeks ago. Last night (3/24/15) I initiated a return for these. Do you want know what I did after that? I purchased a brand new set of these, for the original price I was trying to avoid weeks ago! That should tell you what I think of them, flaws and all, that I actually want these again. If the new pair doesn't work correctly, or like these things did, yes I will be disappointed, but it will be a minor issue for me because all of the other benefits of these things! Plus, having looked over the reviews, I see quite often that Kingston will reach out to those who aren't satisfied with this and offer help. Not many companies care once they have your money. But when I see a company go this far for those who buy their products, being a small business owner myself, I greatly appreciate this large company for acting the way they do, even if the issue isn't resolved. It speaks volumes to those who love the products of a company and to those who may not be aware of what a company offers. But offering great customer service is another great feature of this product, and one you may not find from many others.

Now keep in mind, all of these things are coming from someone who just got into PC gaming, there may be others out there, others that are better, cheaper, more expensive, whatever... But I am glad I stumbled on these when I did, cos I don't really want to go to another product, I love these things!

One last thing, Amazon is amazing! I contacted them about these and when I order the new pair last night, they offered one day shipping free! There are a lot of bad companies out there, but Kingston and Amazon are among the elite in my opinion!",positive
164,Video Games,"HyperX Cloud II - Gaming Headset, 7.1 Surround Sound, Memory Foam Ear Pads, Durable Aluminum Frame, Detachable Microphone, Works with PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One ‚Äì Red",$50.78,4,"PROs:
+ Extremely long battery life (300+ hours; incomparable to anything else out there in gaming headsets)
+ Comfortable and solid construction, heavy but not uncomfortably so
+ Looks good, even in a professional environment
+ Good audio from both cans and microphone
+ Wind/pop screen for mic included
+ Detachable and flexible microphone arm
+ Good for PC and Playstation gamers

CONs:
- Flip-to-mute is not a feature; mute button is hard to find and it's easy to forget if you are muted or not
- Mic LED is dim and hard to see
- Mic volume seems underpowered
- NGenuity software is mostly awful
- EQ doesn't come with preset options, no way to save or load EQ settings
- Won't work over USB when charging
- No Bluetooth or 3.5mm for connecting, uses a 2.4Ghz receiver which will take up a USB port
- Somewhat overpriced given the lack of features other headsets provide
- No Xbox compatability
- Rather heavy (although not uncomfortably so)

Summary:
The HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless only comes in one color at the time of this review, but it is a solid black with red accents. It is a very visually appealing headset, but the real star of this show is the battery life. At 300+ hours of use, there's almost no other gaming headset in the ballpark of comparison. As a result, this has become my de facto workhorse for communications at the office. I could use these at the office every day for over a month before needing to charge it. If you find yourself not wanting to charge yet another device, but still want a wireless headset, this one is for you.

The earpads are comfortable and circumaural (surround your ear instead of sitting on your ear) with a nice plush feel. However, I imagine the material will eventually start aging and flaking off. I've seen this occur with prior headphones with similar earpads. However, I believe HyperX has made them replaceable, so if they do start showing their age, you can purchase replacements.

Some of the issues I have are primarily with the software. The drivers are cumbersome to install, requiring a reboot of your system. And even after that, the DTS:X and EQ don't seem to function. This sort of makes the entire NGenuity software pointless to use. NOTE: I do believe that in order to use the EQ, you must disable any Windows ""spatial sound"" software like Dolby Atmos or Windows Sonic for Headphones. That is also the case for my Corsair headset, so I would reckon the same issue affects these.

One feature missing is the flip-to-mute that other headsets have. It's a great feature that is sorely missed when you don't have it. The mute button is sometimes hard to find by feel, and the LED is hard to see to know whether or not you are muted. A flipped up microphone is a much easier solution.

However, the microphone is flexible and detachable, both excellent inclusions here. The audio seems to be very clear to listeners, and the audio from the cans is a neutral sound. You won't get heavy bass from these (maybe if the EQ worked?) but I didn't expect that anyway. One of the main issues seems to be that the mic is a bit underpowered. I'm not sure I would recommend these for podcasts, but certainly fine for Zoom calls and game chat.

Unlike my Corsair headset, you cannot use these over the provided USB charging cable. Not entirely a big issue given the long battery life, but it is worth noting. You also cannot use these to connect to your phone or to a second device, which is a little preposterous given that even basic earbuds can do these things.

Overall, I like a lot of what this headset offers. It's not flashy, it's got a professional look, and the battery life is phenomenal. I think HyperX needs to work on their software to improve its functionality, and there are features on other headsets that this one lacks. But I'm still impressed enough to give it 4 out of 5 stars.",positive
165,Video Games,"HyperX Cloud II - Gaming Headset, 7.1 Surround Sound, Memory Foam Ear Pads, Durable Aluminum Frame, Detachable Microphone, Works with PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One ‚Äì Red",$50.78,5,"Short of plugging these into a HyperX Quadcast mic, I doubt you'll find a much better setup for gaming....especially at this price point. The sound quality is amazing for headphones in any context and the earcups are very very comfy. The built-in mic sounds very good for a headset mic, but I digress...

I started off with the Cloud I's first and absolutely loved them, but the volume pot started getting scratchy and I worried about damage to the attached cable becoming an issue. So I figured I'd stick with HyperX and give these Cloud Alpha's a try, since the cable does detach. I love the Cloud I's, so I'll just stick to comparing the two of those as they are both phenomenal headsets and would both be a good buy.

-Build and Comfort-
HyperX is just KILLING it on the comfort front IMO. The earcups are basically like tempurpedic memory foam and are a joy to wear. Where the Alpha differs from the Cloud I's is how they feel out of the box. The Alphas still super comfy, but firmer than the Cloud I's. After some wear-in, they soften up, but I can imagine the Alphas lasting longer because of this. Still comfy, just not quite as squishy. Some people may prefer a firmer feel, YMMV.

Both headphones feel very solid and have a good weight to them. Could use some more padding in the headband, but I don't really feel much discomfort after wearing them. This is about the only comfort area I could see them needing improvement on. Not sure if it really amounts to build quality, but the previously mentioned attached cable on the Cloud I's has become an issue for me (the volume pot is really scratchy), but the Alphas have a removable cord and the volume pot feels much more sturdy as well.

-Sound Quality-
Holy crap, I have literally returned $500 Shure headphones in favor of these. And to all assuming I have unrefined, plebian ears...16 years as a guitarist/bassist, audio engineering work for 6 of those years, running PA boards at a few venues, and a gig as a backing bassist for a solo artist (using in-ears) would put me a cut above the typical dude listening to Spotify on his iPhone. I know a good pair when I hear it.

Now the Shures were not flat response for mixing or monitoring, they were listening headphones, but while there is a slight EQ curve and some ""signature"" enhancements on the Alphas, they are surprisingly flat in a good way...albeit with some extended bass and very smooth highs. The difference is the Cloud I's seemed to have more bass due to an EQ bump in the low-end response along with the seal being tighter on your ears with their squishier earcups. The Alphas are firmer and so the seal isn't quite as tight on my head, making for less perceived bass at first, but if you squish them on your ears you catch a bit more of the low-end.

I will also say the low-end on the Alphas is much cleaner than on the Cloud I's, which may not be caught by some listeners. When you hear explosions, rumbling, or are listening to bassy music you won't hear these buzzing or bottoming out like the Cloud I's can. I use an external Sound Blaster card with one of my PCs and my custom EQ curve for music listening is handled beautifully by these Alphas. This by no means is an insult to the Cloud I's, they are easily contenders with most $100-$250 listening headsets out there, but in comparison to the Alphas, these are the differences you'll experience.

-Noise Isolation-
The Alphas are, again, not as tight a seal as the Cloud I's but that could change in time. FWIW, these cut out a noticeable amount of noise...with only really rumbly or booming sounds getting through. A neighbor firing up a giant truck or thunder outside will catch my attention, but high pitched sounds get drowned out when you are listening to music or playing a game. I'm sure with wear they'll get even better, but for a passive headset they do a fine job.

-Mic Quality-
The mic is perfectly fine and right in line with most $100+ gaming headset mics. Don't expect something on-par with a dedicated mic like the HyperX Quadcast or a Razer Siren, this is a totally different league of mic, but does a respectable job. Most people use these for Discord or Zoom calls, or want to cut down on background noise as opposed to using an external mic.

-Connectors-
The core cable has the headphone/mic conductors built into one 3.5mm plug, the same as old iPhone headsets and many other gaming headsets do. There is an extender cable that splits it out to a headphone and mic plug separately. One thing I found weird, is my Cloud I's were the same, but when I plugged the single 3.5mm combo jack into my HyperX Quadcast they flat out would not work. HOWEVER, the Alphas DO work for some reason. Not sure why, seems like basically the same cable. Either way, the cable is long enough for most folks' rigs so no worries on that.

-Overall-
If you want a gaming headset, or even just a headset for listening to music at your computer comfortably, this is an amazing headset. If you're fine with over-ear headphones for listening on the go, there's no reason not to use these IMO. If you're a streamer and want to save money and still get great performance...BUY THESE!!

Some people might scoff at these and not consider them good since they aren't ""Pro Level"" gear, but honestly for monitoring and even music listening I would put these up against nearly any sub-$600 headset. I don't abuse the hell out of my headphones, but they definitely get put to use for hours on end every day and I've still had no issues. The Cloud I's (non-USB) are great too, but for a bit more the Alphas are just plain amazing. The only thing you need to worry about these is if they discontinue them!",positive
166,Video Games,"HyperX Cloud II - Gaming Headset, 7.1 Surround Sound, Memory Foam Ear Pads, Durable Aluminum Frame, Detachable Microphone, Works with PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One ‚Äì Red",$50.78,5,"My experience - I watched tons of video reviews, read headset guides and everything I could after I decided to go wireless. I've been avoiding wireless headsets for a while, because the performance to convenience trade off was just never there. Either the battery would die too often and need to be recharged, or the audio quality was complete garbage. These are by no means an audiophile grade headphone, but I would definitely consider them to be above average for most listeners/consumers. I haven't tried a wireless set personally in 3 years, and the last one I tried was bad. The sound quality was bad, battery life was bad, it was all around a horrible experience and I returned them right away.

What/Why I'm replacing - I came from Audio Technica ADG1X headset that I've had for about 2 and a half years. They have been a great headset, although at a price point of $300 they should be. They were light, comfortable and sounded great. However, I've since moved from a small house in the country to a condo and while I like the large sound stage you get from open back headphones hearing my neighbors and other people around me isn't ideal while gaming or listening to music. The headset was getting a little worn out and my cable is constantly twisting and getting caught under my chair or on my keyboard so I decided it was time for something new and began investigating wireless to see if the technology had come along for headsets as it has for mice (my Logitech G Pro Wireless mouse is a dream).

Look/Style - These HyperX Cloud Flights haven't been out long but clearly HyperX put in the time and research because they just got it right. I've seen several reviewers talk about them not looking cool or flashy enough and flagging that as a negative but in my opinion it's a bonus. You can't even see the headphones when they are on your head. Maybe it's a concern if you're streaming but even Shroud uses these headphones and they look fine. I love that they don't attract a ton of attention.

Battery Life/Buttons/Drivers - I've only had these for a few days but I've yet to run out of battery since the initial charge. I use them with the LED lighting off, because I can't see it anyways when I'm wearing them. The mute button is brilliantly placed and easy to get to, the mic is so easy to detach when you don't need to communicate and would rather not have something in your face. The setup was extremely simple, although they do offer drivers/software you can download to customize further but I prefer the driver-less plug and play functionality and am glad that I can use these without that extra software. All of the controls/buttons are easy to reach and easy to use. FYI, the volume wheel controls the volume for Windows. The headset doesn't have a separate volume wheel. I actually enjoy and prefer this, because my ADG1X had it's own volume wheel (which causes audio to cut out sometimes) that even when working properly I would accidentally brush against and change my volume.

Comfort - Especially important since we tend to wear gaming headsets for hours on end. Several of the reviewers I read or watched said these were the most comfortable headphones they'd ever worn. I was still hesitant to buy into how great they would feel for the sole reason that my ADG1X were extremely light, and amazingly comfortable. I'm happy to say that HyperX got this right too. I definitely feel a little more airflow with the ADG1X which is expected since they are open back, but my ears never got sweaty with the Flights and they were surprisingly lightweight for being a wireless headset. The free feeling of no wires dangling down to your shoulders/chest is quite amazing. It would be extremely difficult if not impossible to go back at this point. My ADG1X had 53mm drivers and the cloud flight have 50mm, but for some reason the actual cups on the ADG1X were a lot bigger and completely round. Whereas the Flights are more ear-shaped and not quite as large. This makes them feel smaller on your head which is a good thing, turning your head doesn't feel quite as cumbersome.

Sound - At the end of the day nothing else about a headphone really matters if they sound like crap. As I mentioned before, these aren't audiophile grade headphones, although I don't think any audiophile would even consider a wireless headset so it's a moot point. You DO lose a certain level of audio quality by going with wireless over a wired connection. Just like you lose some connection speed going from ethernet to WiFi. For most people, this isn't an issue and the sound quality on the Flights is more than good enough to make the convenience of wireless 2-way audio with 30 hour battery life worth it. Technically my old headset (audio technica ADG1X) WAS an audiophile grade headphone, although I didn't use a DAC, amp, or even a soundcard with it to truly push it to its capabilities. That being said, I love the way these Flights sound. I'm actually hearing certain details now that I couldn't hear with my open back headset just due to noise isolation alone. Music overall sounds fuller since the bass is more prevalent (not overblown or shoved down your throat, but it was practically non-existent on my ADG1X). The highs and mids aren't as nicely detailed as on my other headphones but its' nearly impossible to tell without listening back to back and comparing, looking for a difference. The microphone is quite good as well, the people I play with on a daily basis couldn't even tell I was on a headset that cost nearly half the price of my old one. The few that I asked about it said it sounds really good. Now one big concern I did have was volume. It's very common for wireless headsets to have a pretty low volume cap due to power restrictions etc. I even read a few comments from owner's of these headphones that said they didn't get loud enough. I'm happy to say they must have had something configured wrong in their windows audio mixer because these headphones get very loud. Not blow your ear drum out loud, but they can definitely get loud enough to be uncomfortable. I have been keeping them around 50-70% depending on what games I'm playing, and most of my games have master audio set down to 50%. So there is plenty of power. I should note that the 30 hours battery life that HyperX advertises is said to be at a 50% volume. So if you regularly keep the volume higher or maxed you won't get quite as much battery life but it should still be plenty enough that you don't have to charge mid session. I must also say the soundstage is surprisingly better than I thought it would be for closed back phones, and you can very clearly pinpoint the direction of enemy footsteps and gun shots.

Final Thoughts - I highly recommend this headset. The level of performance is unmatched for a wireless headset in this price range. Everything just comes together so nicely in an easy, convenient to use package that performs like a wired headset in many ways. I was able to walk my entire condo (1100 sq ft) without losing/degrading the connection to my PC playing music. I've always considered HyperX a solid contender in the gaming headset market, but to see this as their first attempt at wireless makes me a true believer in the brand and I look forward to seeing what they come up with next!",positive
167,Video Games,"HyperX Cloud II - Gaming Headset, 7.1 Surround Sound, Memory Foam Ear Pads, Durable Aluminum Frame, Detachable Microphone, Works with PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One ‚Äì Red",$50.78,4,"Overall [TLDR] Great headset, not gonna lie, despite its one glaring flaw... I really do enjoy it, the freedom is convenient and the sound quality and fit are on par with their other products.

PROs:
I like the fit - comfortable, I gotta big head and this fits me and cups my ears like a Gamer Goddess's Bosom ... no complaints. Have some Q-Tips though for the next morning after those long gaming sessions, you know what I'm talkin' about... that cupped sound knocks that wax loose - get it out!!

I like the sound (I use the immersion app) - easily comparable to it's Cloud and Alpha S brothers and sisters. Some minor popping if you go too far from your PC whilst getting a drink or something, but DUH, that's to be expected and [see below] the range is decent.

I like the Bluetooth range... not QUITE the 30m advertised, but close enough I can get around most of my house with little interruption. 22-25m for me... acceptable and certainly better than most. I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt here and say the difference is caused by the materials in my walls.

Maintains it's Strength throughout Battery Charge - there was very little give in what the headset was willing to do and it performed consistently with what I viewed as 'acceptable performance,' throughout the testing period. It's a Charged or NOT device - all or nothing.

""THE"" CON:
And here it is, the glaring con, the reason I can't give it the 5-stars I REALLY want to...
Battery Power reporting - It lies!!

Perhaps it's a specific problem to my product... but I doubt it. The headset will report it's battery power, ""Power On - Battery power 100%"" each time you turn the power on regardless of it's actual power level. I intentionally avoided charging, waiting to see if it ever reported anything other than 100%... it NEVER reported anything other than, ""Power On - Battery Power 100%"" period.

A Month (and 2 days) later, it just powered off in the middle of a game, no warning, no report, no anything... just silence. So I knew what happened, I intentionally pushed it to it's breaking point for this specific reason. I plugged in it's charging cord, plugged that into the system and turned it on.

""Power On - Battery Low."" - Nice of it to report that NOW but kind of too little TOO late... right?

So let me be clear, I did NOT measure the specific number of hours used. I'm VERY pleased to report that I've used the headset religiously for the last month (with NO charge) for 'at least' 6 hours a day - easily surpassing the 200+ hrs mark. There were some weekends in there that I ... <cough>... may have fallen asleep during use and used more. So do I believe the near 300hrs per charge claim? YES. Yes I do and I applaud the ingenuity behind whatever tech allows that 300hrs charge capability without degradation of performance to the point it shuts down.

That said, the FALSE reporting of Battery Power - denies the user 2 things:
1) An accurate accounting of actual battery status
2) No confidence in 'Battery Recharge' time.

If the headset reports 100% anytime it has sufficient charge to operate, how am I to determine the REAL time it takes to charge the battery to 100% - has an overnight charge REALLY recharged the battery to 100% or will it power off again in a week?

The populace is informed that it's generally frowned upon to 'overcharge,' a device. However in the case of this device and it's false reports, we're left with little choice. We either use it till it dies and recharge it at that point... hoping we've charged it enough. OR place it on the charger when not in use at the risk of overcharging and reducing the overall life-expectancy of the product.

PLEASE CORRECT the BATTERY CHARGE REPORT FEATURE - otherwise, a fantastic product worthy of the HyperX product line. :) Thanks for reading.",positive

I'm not very easily impressed. I usually buy something, receive it, and carry on with my day. However, I've had these for over two years now, and it only just recently dawned on me how much of an anomaly this headset has been compared to others I've had in the past. In the hundreds, if not thousands of hours I've used this headset for, not once has it ever consciously occurred to me that they're being worn while in use. You slap them on out of the box, adjust the earcups to your liking, and then forget they're there. These things are so damn comfortable that I regularly forget I'm wearing them when I leave my apartment to go do other activities. I can't sing its praises enough in terms of comfort, since it feels like wearing nothing at all once properly adjusted.

As for the sound quality, it's pretty damn good. I've never really been much of an audio snob, but this is more than sufficient if you're just looking for something with quality sound. I've used them for everything from games to podcasts, and there has never been an instance where I was underwhelmed in any capacity by the sound quality here. Absolutely zero complaints from me in this department. The noise cancellation is pretty good, too. I mean, it's not gonna completely tune out anything and everything, but background noise is definitely reduced. My apartment's AC is only about ten feet from my desk, and it gets to be decently loud at times. Though the noise from it is still noticeable when wearing them, it still becomes maybe 30% quieter; even at that close a range. Get sucked into a game, movie, podcast, or album wearing these, and you'll soon forget about any white noise going on in your immediate vicinity anyway. You can also buy HyperX's 7.1 surround sound USB adapter to beef up the sound a bit should you so choose, but I mainly use it for additional volume control and ease of use instead of the surround sound. Maybe I'm using it wrong, but it's just never worked for me.

If you're sometimes rough with your peripherals like me, you probably are looking for something that can take a bit more punishment than most. Rest assured you won't be disappointed here, because this thing's rock solid. Just off the top of my head, my Cloud Alpha has survived:

-Being slammed in the heavy wooden door leading to my apartment
-Being slammed in a car door
-Being accidentally rolled over at least two dozen times by sixty pound steel office chair
-Being tossed onto hardwood flooring when I missed my intended target of the couch more times than I can count
-Being dropped six feet onto solid concrete
-Being stepped on at least two hundred different times
-Being vomited on on more than one occasion, though that can probably be attributed to luck more than anything else

Seriously, there are times when throw this guy around and have the headband pretzel in a concerning fashion, only to pick them up again, put them back on, and continue where I left off none the worse for wear. Every time I'd get a little alarmed at the aggressive way that I'd just manhandled my headset, it'd be a completely irrational fear. Barring smashing these things with a hammer or actually trying to bend the headband 180 degrees in the opposite direction, there's no conceivable way to me you could break these in day to day use. I've included a few pictures of the wear and tear they've accumulated over the years, as well as the lengths to which they regularly bend just to give you an idea of the punishment they can take. Believe me when I say the build quality is second to none.

Now, at this point you know the headset itself is durable, but you might still be wondering about the cable used to connect said headset to your preferred device. Wonder no more. The included cable is 48 inches of (what might as well be) braided steel, and in my two years of usage, it's accumulated nary a scratch save for a small, nearly nonexistent kink below the volume control. It's detachable too, so you never have to worry about the annoyance and potential stress point that comes from having a cable permanently anchored to your headset. I've coiled this thing up all sorts of ways, tossed it into my pockets and backpack in a ball, and it's none the worse for wear considering. Even if you DO somehow manage to break the cable or render it otherwise unusable, don't worry; it can be replaced with any other 3.5mm audio cable with zero hit to sound quality. Trust me. I've checked.

My only real gripe about this product is that my microphone has never worked; even brand new out of the box. I've since bought a replacement mic that also hasn't worked either, so my guess is that it's a manufacturing defect rather than something that broke during use over the years. This is really only something that you should think about if you don't already have a mic and/or will be using this mainly for games. Even if yours also turns out to be broken, I'm sure the folks in customer support would be more than willing to exchange your defective set for a functioning unit.

But yeah. This has got to be the best headset I've ever purchased in the ten odd years I've been using them. The price is a bit steep compared your standard headset fare, but the price of admission is well worth it. I've used these things so much that the pleather on the earcups is starting to peel off, and I'll continue to use them until I literally can't anymore, for whatever reason that may be. Can't recommend them enough.",positive

I've been using them nonstop for 8-14 hours a day, likely more as I sleep with them on sometimes. Despite my not so careful treatment they have held up really well, they show some signs of use but not as bad as I would've thought given how often I have them on.

The battery life is fantastic, but I have an extra long USB charging cable so I can plug it in if it gives me the low battery boop-boop sound but I'm marathoning games or shows and don't want to stop.

The fact that these are wireless is such a convenience! I've been playing the aforementioned games and had to use the bathroom only to hurry back because I heard footsteps approaching or some other alarming sound haha It's really been a lifesaver. Besides games, being able to go get a drink and still hear my show has been nice too.

I'm sure there are better headsets out there, but these seemed good for the price and after a year and a half of near constant use I'm still very happy with them.

I would buy them again in a heartbeat if something happened to my pair.

So, if you're used to more expensive headsets or like wired headsets you'll probably not like these as much as me.

If you've never had something more than the call center Xbox mic then you'll love them as I do.

The sound quality is relatively good and I can't really complain about it. I wish it was better, but for all the music I listen to and shows I watch they are limited by the audio compression of most formats and streaming services anyway. Using them with my receiver they sound much better, but definitely not high-end. Since they weren't meant for that purpose it's not something that can be held against them.

Things I like:
Love the detachable mic!
Love the adjustable boom on the mic
Love the cable material
Like the detachable cable from the volume/mic/surround control while that stays plugged into the USB port.
The cloth ear pieces are comfortable enough that I can wear them for many hours without much discomfort (I don't wear glasses). Sometimes I actually forget I have them on.
Love their durability. It's been through a couple of moves, lots of pulling, jostling, falling, and general mayhem, but have remained in good condition. I've paid more for 'phones that took less abuse and didn't stay in half as decent of a condition.

Things I don't like

The volume/mic/surround controller is too heavy.
The volume/mic/surround controller clip is cheap and fragile (mine broke on the first use from very little effort)
The non-cloth ear pieces are not comfortable for moderate to long periods and hold heat. You might just sweat with them or feel pain after more than an hour or two of use.
The bass using the cloth ear pieces are woefully inadequate. Even after boosting the bass using other software these are disappointing. I'm not expecting dance club, or cinema level bass. I just want to be able to experience it more. Still, it's not unnoticeable and the overall quality is enough to enjoy my audio choices.

If I had to purchase them again I probably would. The dislikes are not that bad and I had to really think back to when I first used these to remember all the negatives. The only lingering negative is a lack of bass with the cloth ear pieces.",positive

Look for reviews and opinions from other people, and they all said the same thing, the low ones. Using them made me realize this too, and how annoying it can be in some games, though you get used to it over time. I also have several Pros and Cons with these headphones.

Pros:
‚ÄîThey are comfortable, the mats do not bother, they are soft and do not store sweat.
‚ÄîThey're good for games and movies. (Not the use in music, sorry) In the case of FPS games the story is different, but I detail that in the Cons. Now for games like Subnautica, Skyrim, Far Cry, Assassin's Creed and Borderlands are more than great, they wrap you in the game environment in an incredible way.
‚ÄîThe microphone is removable, as is its cable, something that is appreciated.
‚ÄîGood material, they are made of some regulated plastic, in addition to the fact that their mallets are made of aluminum.

Midpoint: This can be something bad or good depending on each person, for me it is something bad. Its cable is very long, for someone like me who has his PC next to him, it means that he has two meters of cable hanging out there.

Cons:
‚ÄîPrice, even if I bought it while it was on sale ($60), I honestly wouldn't pay its original price ($120) for them.
‚ÄîAs I said, and I repeat, the basses. For FPS/Shooter games, like Valorant, Call of Duty or CSGO, this will be a problem. When I started playing with them, the enemy footsteps and the shots could not be differentiated in distance, I could not know if what I heard was happening right next to me, or ten meters from me. After rebooting my PC the sounds were adjusted, but I still have some problems differentiating where exactly the sound is coming from. (Although Valorant doesn't have the best sound system either, let's be honest)
‚ÄîThe volume, I don't know what this is due to (I don't know much about audio), but with my previous headphones, some Hyperx Cloud Stinger, I had them with the volume at 20% of how loud they sounded, instead, with these the I have had to go up to 40% even in some other games I have had to go up to 60%.
‚ÄîAlthough they can be used on consoles, I do not recommend it. Just use them on PC, with its USB extension.

Until now that would be, as time goes by and I continue to use them, I will add something if it is the case. In the meantime, would you recommend them? If they are on sale, yes. Otherwise, I'd say look for other options for the price. They are not bad, because they are not, but there are things that need to be fixed to make them better, and worth their price.",positive

173,Video Games,Nintendo Switch ‚Äì OLED Model w/ White Joy-Con,$349.99,5,"I absolutely love the product. I had a spat when I got it. It didn't have a charger for the dock. However talking to Amazon Support they corrected it for me and I was able to get a charger off the store. With the Switch Oled, you not only are able to have a bit more vibrant colors, but the system itself has great battery life. I had the original switch and this is leagues better. I literally had the switch in my bed for 4 days playing off and on and within those 4 days the battery went as low as 30% and the charging happens fairly quick, not to mention you can dock it and play it while it charges on a big screen tv.

SO IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A SWITCH IS OR HOW IT WORKS LET ME EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES

1. theres 3 versions
- Switch (original one with a dock and can be played on a tv w/ a smaller screen than Oled)
- Switch lite (the hand held version with no dock and can't be played on a tv)
- Switch Oled (newest one, vibrant colors on screen, Larger screen, and has a tv dock)

2. Games
- The switch is one of the better nintendo systems that have more 3rd party games on it, although the selections are smaller than the Playstation and Xbox, the switch gives you versatility to not only bring it with you on the go to play games, it gives you the action to play with multiple people by separating the joy cons (controllers) and with that you can use each one sideways as a controller allowing two people to play and with multiple joy cons you can have a session of multiple people.

-It has both digital and cartridge games. the cartridge games are very small, and they also have a fast install time. The games are very fun to play and have lots of multiplayer options. No full VoIP on the system but they have an app for cellphones to use.

- the store usually has great deals on titles as most of the cartridge games cost full price or barely have anything discounted at places like Target, Walmart or Gamestop.

3. How they work (docked versions)
- a docked Switch connects to the TV, it allows the device to charge and you can play games as it charges on the dock.
- it has a tabletop mode where you can play games on the screen as a tv. In other words you can still use a controller but have the tablet part standing upwards as you use a full controller to play on it.
- Handheld is where the Joy cons are attached to the tablet and you use it like a handheld or similar to a gameboy or something in that way.

Personally it's worth the money and Nintendo has usually very good systems that last a long time. Although they might not be the best graphically they have some fun family friendly first party games.",positive
174,Video Games,Nintendo Switch ‚Äì OLED Model w/ White Joy-Con,$349.99,5,"First, to be clear, I play exclusively in handheld mode. (No proper technophile allows a video game system to be connected to their 4k tv if it does not output 4k. LOL!) I am also a console (Xbox) gamer and have been playing video games since the mid 1980s.

With that being said, this device is shockingly awesome. Why? You can basically play games with the graphically fidelity of almost (but not quite) the Xbox One/PS 4 in your hands. This blows me away. The fact that I can play NBA 2k, FIFA, Need for Speed, Grid, Mortal Kombat, Puzzle Quest and so many other games on the go is truly a joy to behold. As a result, much to my surprise, this has been the console I have ended up playing the most. It's easy to see why - I can take it with me wherever I go. I travel for work and personal reasons. This is with me and I can continue playing my games on it. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy my Xbox experience and still play PC games as well. They are awesome. However, I notice I play this more because it can be on an airplane with me, in the bed, during lunch at work, when I travel, etc. Then, sometimes when I get home, I may want to continue my gaming. So it is racking up more hours than my Xbox and PC (which I certainly still enjoy).

Then, the OLED screen is gorgeous. I had an original Switch. I absolutely love this screen, the brightness, sharpness and clarity. Some games look totally different. If you already have an original Switch, if you can, sell it (or give it away) and get this one. I absolutely love it. I even bought a 512GB micro SD card. I am in a form of gaming Nirvana. You will really enjoy this model.

Finally, I do think that Nintendo is in a truly awesome position with the Switch. I am not sure if Nintendo even realizes how close they are to dominating the video game market for decades. Why? Think about it. As of January 2022 the Switch is the leading console with over 100 million units sold. It really, at this point, needs one thing to finish off the competition for decades. What is it they need? Just a little more power. If Nintendo creates a device that has the graphical and processing power of an Xbox One/PS4, can do 1080p in handheld mode, with a 7 inch OLED screen, (and 4k when docked) Nintendo will rule gaming for at least a decade. Why? 1080p on OLED, at the handheld distance from the eye, appears almost as detailed as 4k at a tv watching distance. With the processing power of the Xbox One/PS4, developers can bring tons of more of their best games (triple A titles) to the Switch. So, a Switch that powerful, with a large number of triple A games on it and with a screen that good in handheld mode, the Switch's market share would crush the competition.

At any rate, I digress. If you are considering this device. Get it! Period. The build is so awesome on this variant. You will love it.

I have to go now. I have to play my OLED Switch - LOL!

Also, the delivery from this seller was also good. It came ahead of time.",positive
175,Video Games,Nintendo Switch ‚Äì OLED Model w/ White Joy-Con,$349.99,4,"The multiple play methods, on screen or hand-held, makes this a versatile platform. Controller design to be used as individual controllers or use two controllers, one in each hand is a brilliant idea....just poorly executed. Docking the individual controllers onto the dual controller or installing the tether straps is awkward. I accidently installed backwards and had to nearly break the controller to back the tether straps off. Also sliding the controller onto a charging dock is not smooth have to line up just perfectly. All the familiar games are available and even the old school games can be accessed online. All-in-all a great console but can be tweaked to make it even better.",positive
176,Video Games,Nintendo Switch ‚Äì OLED Model w/ White Joy-Con,$349.99,5,"my original switch was collecting some dust in docked mode and I figured I'd give this one a shot with some rewards points i had saved up.

I picked it up, transferred my save data to it and played some games that i was familiar with and the handheld experience absolutely shocked me. I heard that the display wasn't that much of an upgrade over the original, but I strongly disagree.

The display is about a half inch larger all around, with almost no bezel at all. The colors that the OLED display can produce are absolutely phenomenal. the colors in every game are crisp and bright. dark shadows in game are deep and rich and everything intended to glow in a game looks incredibly lively.

Another subtle but superb upgrade is the console's kickstand. with the OLED version, it spans the length of the console (minus joycons) and it's more akin the the weird ""fluid hinge"" used in the Microsoft surface line of computer tablets. it feels super sturdy and very refined compared to the original dinky kickstand.

unironically, this upgrade was the tipping point that made me go from a ""docked mode only"" preference to almost entirely handheld mode. it totally sold me with the superior handheld gaming experience over the original. 500% recommend it, especially if you haven't gotten a switch yet or you're looking to brush the dust off your docked original switch, you'll never look back.",positive
177,Video Games,Nintendo Switch ‚Äì OLED Model w/ White Joy-Con,$349.99,4,"Nintendo Switch ‚Äì OLED Model was purchased as a gift and all in all is not a bad gaming system. I was honestly hoping for a little more value with the system, why it does not come with they joycon control toppers makes no sense to me, but entertainment with this device is really meant for gaming. Pricing of games for the Switch seems pretty high to me, and as you really only have two options for purchasing games (physical card or software download) most options are available through the Nintendo E-store but pricing there is high as well. Nintendo also offers a Switch online service which will allow user to purchase the use of emulated cloud gaming for the NES, SNES, N64, and Sega Genesis (highly recommend the family plan for people who buy their kids this product). Circling back to my one major concern, value, the Switch only offers Hulu as a streaming service. Yikes‚Ä¶.why?!?! Its really beyond me.",positive

182,Video Games,Xbox Core Wireless Controller ‚Äì Electric Volt,$59.99,5,"Okay, let me start by saying that I too was not sure if this wireless controller would work without a USB dongle on windows 10. I did NOT buy the USB dongle version.
If you're wanting a Bluetooth controller please make sure you have Bluetooth in your computer. 99% of the time you have Bluetooth with a wifi card or wifi on a m.2 card. If you don't have either, you probably don't have a Bluetooth connection.
I have a wifi card, so I have bluetooth..
So assuming you have all of these things (bluetooth connection) all you simply have to do is turn on the controller, hold down the sync button and windows will ask if you would like to pair the controller. Click yes and you're done. Don't be fooled by the other reviews. I simply wanted to write this review to help assure others that this controller will work easily on a modern computer",positive

184,Video Games,Xbox Core Wireless Controller ‚Äì Electric Volt,$59.99,5,"Although there's been a lot of buzz (and rightfully so) around the new Dualsense PS5 controller, Microsoft decided to take a very different approach from Sony; meaningful, iterative improvements to an already solid base. The first version I ever used, model 1697, was the best controller I had ever used up to that point. It was the primary reason I switched from my XB360, as I was unable to pair it with the console, but the controller was too good to go back. Clicky, responsive buttons, lighter weight, easily accessible battery door, good battery life, solid accuracy and excellent haptic feedback in the triggers made me fall in love. Jump to the next model, the 1708, and all those things remained, but there was a different finish and now the awesome addition of Bluetooth. This has been the controller I've used on console and PC for the better part of 5 straight years. I've even tried to pair it with a couple Sony systems to experience some of the better games exclusive to that platform (I was unsuccessful BTW). Now, introduce this model, the 1914, and I feel like it's 2 steps forward and a step backwards. The D-Pad is outrageously good and responsive, the trigger texturing gives a more involved feel, the matte finish makes it less vulnerable to oils or greases making it slippery and the battery door redesign is a very slight but meaningful touch. Even the added feature of showing the battery level on PC is a tiny detail that shows the thoughtfulness that went into crafting this. The only reason this is not a 5 is the connectivity. Full disclosure, this is primarily used with a PC in this use case, and as such, you WILL need the XBox accessories app, as I needed to apply an update fresh out the box. The Bluetooth connection on my 1708 literally never dropped out in my entire memory of use. Extremely strong, very dependable and no lag to speak of. The 1914, not so much. There's been no observable lag, and when it works, it's easily better, but the connection is very spotty. As mentioned, an update was necessary right out of the box, and performance marginally improved, but as it stands, during a 3 hr play session last night it lost connection at least 10 times, with the Xbox light blinking a few times and going solid again roughly every 20 mins or so. I tried multiple games, including very tight shooters and it's the same thing; excellent performance when it's working, a temporary drop for no more than 5 seconds, then back to working as if nothing happened. I've already gone the driver route of making sure everything is updated correctly, but this seems to be more a 1914 problem, as the 1708 has never had this problem with a console or 3 different PCs with 3 different Bluetooth adapters. Funny though, a wireless adapter is available, and is touted as the primary way to connect without a USB cable (the USB cable does work flawlessly BTW). Of course, there is a fee for this adapter, which makes me feel like this is the classic create a problem, sell the solution sort of scenario, which has soured my experience greatly here. This is a relatively new device, having only been on the market for a little over a month at the time of this writing, so it's definitely possible for this issue to be resolved, but there's currently no discount for this unit, so you're being asked the complete price for an incomplete experience for the time being. Once (if) this issue is resolved, I will absolutely change this to a 5, but right now, with the drops, it's a mediocre purchase at best, with the 1708 currently being a better option, and at a lesser price. Best of luck.

Edit: In order to have the update applied, you must FIRST connect to the PC with your USB-C and use the Xbox accessories app to update, then, most importantly, you must UNPAIR the controller if it was previously paired. If it's the first time pairing, it won't be an issue, but if you previously were paired before the update, it will not apply. After following these steps, I can confidently report all connection issues have been fixed, and there have been no Bluetooth drops to speak of. This is now a 5 star device.",positive

186,Video Games,Xbox Core Wireless Controller ‚Äì Electric Volt,$59.99,4,"First off, controller's fine. Feels hefty, but not too heavy. Comfortable to hold and the color itself is lovely. I'm overall happy I finally upgraded from my old XBOX 360 controller on my PC.

All that being said:
-It doesn't come with a chargeable battery
-Even if you buy a rechargeable battery there's no way to tell on the normal controller how charged it is unless you're using the PC's XBOX app (some 3rd party batteries do try to negate this)
-Trying to use bluetooth on my PC was really spotty for me (I tried multiple dongles and updated the controller firmware etc, but clearly not everyone is having this problem)
-To actually get wireless connectivity to my PC I also had to buy another freaking device

So, let's tally this up (at the time of my purchase at least):
XBOX Controller: $60
Rechargeable Battery: $22
XBOX Wireless Dongle: $28
Total: $110

It *is* a good controller, but know that depending on what you want, it may be more expensive then you initially think. Wireless thankfully does work fine when using the XBOX Dongle, so if you are having trouble with bluetooth it's a good option to try.",positive
187,Video Games,Xbox Core Wireless Controller ‚Äì Electric Volt,$59.99,5,"Ever find yourself searching for your controller? This one asserts itself from across the room. If you spend more than a few seconds looking for it, it's probably in another room, possibly another building.

However, the colour coding of the buttons is lost so if that's relevant to your accomplishing QTE's, expect an adjustment period. There's a legend between the buttons that shows what colour the buttons usually are, but that's not something you're likely to read with peripheral vision the way you might a classic X-box colourway.

The worst thing about it though, is a flaw I believe is common to this generation of controllers. I find I have to turn off rumble feedback, as well as take extra care when putting the controller down because I'm using it wired to my PC. When any pressure is placed on the USB C port the controller loses connection and the cable has to be unplugged from the controller and reseated to re-establish connection. This loss occurs from setting the controller down on a table, and can happen from rumble feedback. If you're using it wireless you might not experience this issue.",positive

202,Video Games,PlayStation 5 Console,$499.99,5,"I've wanted a PS5 for a while now. Ironically, it has less to do with any PS5-exclusive games (you can count those on one hand, pretty much), but after getting a 4K TV, I wanted to see just how big of a difference there was in my existing PS4 library...plus, I wanted a PS5 anyway. Given the problematic microchip shortage (still aching to get a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, thanks scalpers), I wasn't confident in getting one of these anytime soon, not to mention the rampant scalping that is still ongoing. When I heard about Amazon's invitation approach, I thought ""what the heck?"" and gave it a shot. I got my invite days later, and pulled the trigger.

I got a month of the Premium Plus membership, which I also heartily recommend, especially for those who are just starting too dip their toes into video games. It's a real good deal. Played through all of Dark Pictures: Little Hope and Ys IX, and a few game trials and more. It's at its best on the PS5, BTW. The system is excellent, but I should mention that at this time, it's essentially a ""Super PS4 Pro"". I know that this is consistent with new systems, and it appears that current global events are putting the stranglehold on more innovation, but I am glad to see some really awesome PS5 games coming soon, especially Alan Wake 2, Street Fighter 6, and more.

I've just gotta say it. The system looks weird, and weirder still on its side. It comes with a base that does the job, but like my wife described it, it looks ""melted"". My own opinion, I think it's too much design, but don't judge a book by its cover. The system and interface is exceptional, and gameplay is wonderful. The controller has even more heft to it than the PS4 DualShock, probably thanks to all the little motors in it delivering haptic feedback. This takes a lot of getting used to, but it's so novel that I'm more intrigued by it than anything else.

I'm really glad to get one of these, even if it was at full MSRP. (I usually wait for Black Friday deals, but given the current climate for microprocessors and the demand of these, I wasn't counting on this for at least a couple of years.) For anyone who has struggled to get one, really just request an invite. No obligation, but mine literally shipped and arrived the day I ordered it. No other business is even coming close to as (frankly) elegant way of fighting the scalpers on this front than Amazon.

PS has fixed a lot of bugs and I can't stress how important updating the console is before you play - just update it first and save yourself the frustration.

The console iself is quick, graphics amazing - everything you would expect but the thing I took notice of the most is the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers of the new pad... you'll just have to expeience it yourself. The price is a bit high especially since most consoles are now coming from resellers.

213,Video Games,PlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller ‚Äì Midnight Black,$69.00,4,"Definitely, a leap in gaming technology over the Dual Shocks. Great haptic feedback, adaptive triggers along with the built-in speaker and microphone makes for a great gaming combination that really puts you into the game.

You feel every swing, bullet, raindrop, even the mush of walking in sand. The gamepad gives you a detailed level of force feedback.

I like the trigger feedback that was lacking on the Dual Shocks. It really brings a new sense to the game that you didn‚Äôt know you missed until you experience it on this gamepad.

You can use the mic to chat or in some cases, such as in Astro‚Äôs playroom, use it as part of the game play.

It is slightly thicker and bigger than the Dualshocks, but feels like a sturdy controller. Definitely a big step up over the PS3 controllers that feel flimsy in comparison now. The controller is comfortable to hold and use.

Overall, the gamepad is a little pricy, but is a big step forward in technology, that makes games even more immersive and fun to play. I just hope the next generation of games take advantage of these features.

FOR NON-GAMERS BUYING THESE FOR GAMERS!!!!
These controllers are perfect for PlayStation5 (PS5) and Computer (PC). Does not work on anything else!!! Do not get unless it's for PS5 or PC

This is maybe the best controller I've ever used! The haptic feedback is amazing! The adaptive triggers are really cool! And playing with these is a whole new experience. It's like having genuine 5.1 surround but for rumble!

The raised texture on the bottom of the grips works well to prevent slipping, but might become a bit slick, if like me you tend to get sweaty hands while playing. Buttons and shoulder buttons are appropriately clicky, triggers have a nice pull, with a slight tension towards the end. Joysticks have some nice tension and the nubs have raised edges so your thumbs won't slide off.

For the best features, you need to be playing a game which supports the other functions of the DualSense. The triggers are adaptive and can change resistance on the fly in games like Ratchet and Clank:Rift Apart, Horizon: Forbidden West, or Returnal. This can be really fantastic, and lends different weapons surprisingly different feels, like a shotgun that has a soft stop in the middle of a pull for one or two barrels for Ratchet and Clank. The touch pad is underutilized in most games but its nice big button to have.

Vibration also has a significant upgrade on supported games. You'll be able to ""feel"" different surfaces or even rain ""falling"" as you play. Its difficult to accurately describe without going hands on.

The only negative that I've encountered so far for me, is that the additional features seem to come with a reduced battery life compared to PS4/PS3 controllers. I would recommend having two controllers if you want uninterrupted play without being tethered to the PS5 or PC by a USB-C cable.",positive
216,Video Games,PlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller ‚Äì Midnight Black,$69.00,5,"I've had the controller for my PC for about 5-6 months now. While I can definitely say I love it, there are two drawbacks...

1) game support - game support for the DualSense features are limited. Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War, for example, only supports the adaptive triggers. It does not support the haptic feedback vibrations. Other games have full support, such as Far Cry 6 (amazing game btw, definitely recommend!). But, not every new game supports it. Games such as Destiny 2 have support for only the control scheme of a PlayStation controller in general, but no support for Haptic Feedback or the Adaptive Triggers.

2) cable vs. wireless support - on PC, you're limited to a wired connection, for now. This is especially a blow because there isn't a USB cable included in the box. However, I personally had no issue in terms of obtaining a USB cable, seeing as it used USB type C, of which I have an assortment of in my house (as opposed to micro USB that the previous controller used, which I have little to none of). That being said, it WILL work over wireless, but every game with controller support (including Windows, itself) assumes it as a generic Bluetooth gamepad and forces the Xbox controller layout to be used, which sucks.

That being said, if you can deal with the limited games support and wired connection, it's definitely an amazing controller! I enjoy it more than my Xbox Controller for the ergonomics alone, seeing as it's extremely comfortable for hours on end of gameplay! Not to mention, my hands generally don't feel anywhere near as sweaty as when I use my Xbox Controller. I'm even considering buying the black one to match my other peripherals for my PC instead of another color (I currently have the White one).

Overall rating? I'd say about a 4.7/5! ^_^

Edit (April 22nd, 2022): I have noticed there is signs of slight stick drift, as of last night. While mine didn't happen as soon as most reviews here I've read, I thought I'd mention it is there. Seeing as I didn't order mine when the revised controller batch came along (I believe Sony revamped these in February? Don't quote me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), I knew it was bound to happen soon to be honest. So I've been prepared for it. Good thing I plan to buy the black one now! :D",positive
217,Video Games,PlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller ‚Äì Midnight Black,$69.00,5,"I will preface this by saying I am using this controller for PC use solely, via a wired connection. I have not tested out the battery life so I cannot comment on that aspect.

In the fall of 1995, I accompanied my parents to Sears to purchase for my older brother's birthday a Playstation video game console and a copy of Mortal Kombat 3. While I'd played the NES, SNES, and Sega Genesis before, this era was what truly kicked off my adoration of video games.

Through the years, I had switched back and forth between Xbox and Playstation, finding qualities I appreciated for both, but the library that Sony offered tended to sway me that way. However, I found Xbox's offerings of controllers to be superior. The Dualshock 4 was a great update to the Dualshock, but I had found that the Xbox One controller was, in the end, the best controller I had held in my hands.

Now, enter the Dualsense. A refined shape, with some intriguing new updates, may, over time, render the Xbox One controller a runner-up in my eyes. The update to the triggers is fantastic from what I have experienced thus far, and it just feels so comfortable to hold.

I appreciate the entire contoller (minus the face buttons and D-pad) are all a satin finish, instead of having a shinier appearance. When playing for long sets, the controller stays in your hands better.

As I had mentioned, I cannot offer any stance on the battery life, but with the Dualshock 4, I had a stand I would deposit the controller onto after a session and it would be charging constantly. I also do not play for more than 2-3 hour bursts at a time, so my opinion on this is likely null for lots of gamers.",positive

After 10 games of competitive I've made up my mind and I am in need of writing a review cause this is something else. This controller brings a level of control I've never experienced in the past. I immediately ranked up 2 divisions (currently at grand champion) and feel like I can do things I wasn't able to do before just because of the comfort it brings.
It's not just the ergonomic shape; but more importantly; the feel of the joysticks. It's hard to explain, but it the tension and smoothness feel like something I've never experienced with any other controller; and I have plenty of experience with other controllers.

I have controllers for every generation of PS and Xbox and even Nintendo;
I am from the opinion that the DS4 was a step backwards from DS3 in comfort. I could elaborate but that's not he point of this review. I'll focus on DS5/Dualsense.
My main controller for the past couple years has been the Xbox One controller; I was unsure if this could possibly surpass the comfort of it or possibly provide me an upgrade in any way but I was definitely wrong.

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.",negative

You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me.",positive

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!",positive

Back in 2010 I had purchased the Logitech G500 and LOVED it! Very comfortable, solid build, lots of customization options, and worked forever. After 10 years my cat chewed through the cord and so I had to get a new mouse. It was an easy choice to try the Logitech G502 since I thought it was the next iteration of the mouse I loved so much.

HOWEVER, after opening it I could see the there was a downgrade in build quality. The mouse felt harder yet more fragile than my previous one. Still, for the price it didn't seem too bad. However, after about a year and a half of medium duty use, the primary left click button began to stop working, requiring either a lot of pressure or hard tapping to get it to work. Very frustrating since I've bought Logitech products for over twenty years and been very happy with them previously.

I will say that perhaps my mouse is the exception. The price of the mouse was pretty reasonable, and if I hadn't had such a great experience with the G500 I probably would not have been as disappointed.

232,Video Games,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‚ÄëCon,$299.99,5,"This review is targeted at newcomers so for veterans of Nintendo products, not much new information here! As for everyone else looking at this gaming system wondering if its right for them, I'll do my best to explain what this model in particular brings to the table. In my particular case a: ""Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy‚ÄëCon - HAC-001(-01)""

Introduction to the system/What is a Nintendo Switch?:
The Nintendo Switch is a ""hybrid system"". Lets break it down to its core do understand what people mean by ""hybrid system"", lets start with what is basically a gaming tablet with a plastic screen and a multi-touch-touchscreen. This is the ""Switch itself"" so to speak. For a ""console"", it is EXTREMELY thin in comparison to a PS4 or Xbox One for example. This also means it takes significantly less energy to run. The internal cooling fan is also significantly quieter than either of the prior two other consoles mentioned.

That multi-touch-touchscreen allows for certain mobile games like Muse Dash, VOEZ, Deemo, and many others to be ported to the Switch without compromising their touch screen gimmicks from their mobile phone counterparts. Despite this, many of them do have support for button controls. Many Switch games gives you options on how you want to play and this is a running theme with the Switch.

Now for the controllers which are ""hybrid controllers"" in a way. For those of you who used the Nintendo Wii, these ""Joy Cons"" share and improved upon the motion controls from the Wii days, except in addition to the motion controls, Nintendo also made the actual button layout resemble a regular controller like the button layout found on a Xbox One controller for example. Not that weird button layout on the Wii for example. This means both the Wii crowd can assimilate into this new generation of Nintendo, along side the core gamers who would prefer a more ""traditional"" controller button set up.
Normally a player would use both Joy Cons together as a pair, whether that be attached to the Switch Tablet itself to be played on the go like a 3DS (be it much longer than a 3DS), at home and connected to a plastic grip that gives you those controller ""thighs"" to make it easier to hold and to make it feel more like a more traditional controller even more. You can even use the Joy Cons without them being attached to anything like the Wiimote and Numchuck, but without that annoying wire in between your controllers. This ""detached"" controller style option with the Joy Cons allows you to play in positions otherwise impossible with a more ""static"" controller. For example, you can play with one arm behind your head while the other arm is resting on your stomach as you play from your bed or couch.

These Joy Cons also have two buttons on the plastic rails that connect them to the Switch Tablet piece. These buttons are functional and you can actually use just a single Joy Con per player in certain supported games.
Key word ""supported games"". This is where the main issue with the Nintendo Switch lies, Nintendo laid the foundation for developers to have the best tools at their deposal but not all of them use them. Some developers have games that cost less overall on the Switch than their original releases on other systems, or from mobile with mobile's atrocious micro-transactions , meanwhile there's other developers that neither have the full game on the physical game cartridges while having the audacity to be more expensive on the Switch. But again, its ALL developer based. Research the game developers in question to see if you're getting the best value for buying their ports (or original) releases on the Nintendo Switch.

Oh right, this gaming system uses cartridges. Don't worry, they're not those huge ones from the Nintendo 64 days! They're more Nintendo 3DS sized if anything. If the developer you choose did it properly, a entire game can fit on these cartridges. This means you can play those properly done physical releases immediately without any additional downloads. But again, developer based. Some of them DO only ""partially"" have the game on the Switch Cartridge(s). Do your research.

Now to talk about the Dock that connects the Switch Tablet to a TV.
If you open up the back side of the Dock, there should be two slits near the bottom of the Dock. The Switch Tablet has two air vents that when ""docked"" should be right up against those vents. Please try not to block off those vents so the Switch Tablet as a easier time cooling itself off while you (and others) play in ""TV Mode"". The Switch Tablet also has a air-vent on the top. So keep that area of the Switch Tablet clear as well.

This particular model of the Nintendo Switch, model number ""HAC-001(-01)"", is different from day one Nintendo Switch systems in the sense that Switches with the model number ""HAC-001(-01)"" have better battery life. For example, day one Switches would run really graphically/resource intensive games for about 2 hours 30 minutes (or 2.5 hours) minimum. Whereas this new ""HAC-001(-01)"" numbered Switch(es) can run those games for up to 4.5 hours minimum in ""handheld mode"". The way these ""new Switches"" accomplish this is by having a more efficient component in the inside of the Tablet piece. This also means these new Switches are more energy efficient and less prone to overheating than the day one models. So this is even helpful for people who would use this gaming system for TV use.

If you don't have a Switch yet, I recommend this model for its versatility. You never know when you'll change your mind on ""how"" you want to play. I used to use it mostly in TV mode but eventually started using it more and more while outside in general. For example, on the bus, while waiting for something to start whether it be a class, jury duty, meeting, you name it. The Nintendo Switch will make that wait all the less painful. Waiting to be called or dismissed for jury duty especially.

Oh, I almost forgot! You CAN use power banks with the Nintendo Switch! The minimum power requirements for a power bank to work with a Nintendo Switch is 5 Volts, and 2.4 Amps. The cable you use to plug the Switch Tablet with a power bank can be found bundled with the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, or the Nintendo Switch Charging Grip. Both of those products come with the USB cable required to use a Nintendo Switch with a power bank. So even if you manage to drain this new Switch's battery life on a long trip, bring a battery bank and you can extend its battery life even further. But again, this mostly won't be needed unless you're on a air ride for over 7 hours or so. Anything less than that, if you're smart about it, you can get away with just the Switch's battery life.
Speaking of battery life, the Joy Cons each have a estimated battery life of 20 hours each. Let me repeat that, 20 hours. That brings its competition's controllers to shame!
So if you keep your Joy Cons charged overnight (they charge when connected to the Switch Tablet while the Tablet is charging in either the Dock or via battery bank), they ain't going to die unless you deliberately go out of your way not to charge them at least once a week.

When their batteries are completely dead, both the Switch Tablet and one pair of Joy Cons takes about 3 hours to fully charge everything. So if you're able to, put the Switch Tablet with the pair of Joy Cons connected to it, and leave the three of them in the Dock overnight to keep everything nice and charged for tomorrows challenges.
Get creative, once you get used to the options the Nintendo Switch offers, going to anything else, you'll realize that you'd taken for granted with the Nintendo Switch! In my particular case, using the two Joy Cons in each hand unconnected. I can't do that with a keyboard and mouse! So get your Joy Cons, get them in a position that works for you, get cozy on your couch, bed, etc. and have some fun with your game(s) of choice!
Just keep in mind it is a GAMING SYSTEM FIRST, and the ""entertainment media center"" SECOND. So as of January 15th, 2020 don't expect things like Netflix to be on this machine. If you treat it as a DEDICATED gaming system, you're in for one hell of a ride!
Just don't forget your screen protector since the Switch Tablet's screen is made of plastic!

If you don't want to go through all of them, get this one:
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XDWBPMZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
It should serve most peoples' needs. Its durable, cheap, anti-glare, self heals from minor scratches, etc. Its the most value for the price I've found from searching through all of what Amazon has as far as Switch Tablet screen protectors go.

As far as the ""system itself"" goes, this is pretty much all of the information that you'd need. Everything else is developer centered, game wise. Do your research, and think very carefully which developers will give you the best bang for your buck!",positive
233,Video Games,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‚ÄëCon,$299.99,4,"I have an loaded opinion on this console that I want to express. The Switch is flawed. As an avid gamer who usually ends up buying all the consoles (except the xbox one) and loves the hardware behind these machines, the switch was super cool when I first heard about it and saw it. I got one not to long after release once they came back to my area. Though it took awhile to save up for any games as during that point in its life, everything was expensive on it and 3rd party devs hadn't moved to it yet. Also there were no media apps on it besides hulu which somehow is still a thing, surprising. But that isn't what I want to talk about, its more how the switch feels really damn cheap.

I don't mean cheap as with the plastic shell either (but that is an issue, dislike the texture a lot, and it was also damaged by strong adhesives from dbrand before), but you get a wimpy TN panel for its main built in display, in an era where amoled and ips are very obtainable for device of this size (the original psvita was oled, so it could have been possible). As the resolution is at a solid 720p, which can help balance good enough quality on the go with actual game performance, I feel like they should have opted for a nicer quality screen to have better range of colors, would have created more vivid scenes using sharper and brighter colors. Instead they chose washed out TN panels which leave a lot to be desired when comparing it to any handheld screen semi modern hand held screen with exception of DS's which also chose awful screens. (and some might argue TN for faster response time, and to that, I highly disagree with improvements to other display types, and also for the type of audience the switch aims at)

Next I want to talk about the Joycons, as they are lovely little controllers that snap onto the side of the console with a satisfying click. I actually wouldn't have minded them despite being kinda awful when using them on a big screen if they worked correctly, but three years in and these things are still built to fail. There is a major design flaw in them that eventually has the analogue stick wear our and start ""drifting"", making the controller effectively useless. If these were cheap, maybe I wouldn't care as much, but they are 80$ to replace. Sure you can contact nintendo customer support and they sometimes take care of you, but this is a hassle and shouldn't even be a problem. They could have just owned up to the mistake, and redesigned the controllers at this point. ( pro controller is actually a solid design, but its more expensive then both ps4 and xbox one controllers so I dislike recommending it. I believe its the amiibo sensor that does this and that's just bad).

Lastly, I kinda wanna just complain about nintendo being nintendo. But before that I want to praise them for how far they did come up to this point. There is finally 3rd party content being pushed on the Switch and thats awesome. It seems like they did listen a bit and made it much easier to get games on the Switch. Ok now onto the bad. The Switch has no utility, and I get that its a gaming console, but still its surprsing that the most mobile and potentially flexible console lacks basic OS features that things like the ps4, psvita, and even 3DS were capable of doing such as, have a variety of streaming services, a basic web browser, and customizing the layout of your home screen/having fun backgrounds. There is no personality to the switch despite it being one of the most unique consoles I have ever seen, which is quite baffling to me. Despite the console featuring bluetooth for its joycons and pro controller, you cant connect bluetooth headphones to it without a 3rd party adapter, which is a little baffling for an on the go console. The UI looks pretty ugly when put onto a big screen, just a personal gripe of mine, I really don't like it. Lastly, the game cartridges are a letdown. The reason games usually feel more expensive on the switch is because they more often then not are. This is due to the game cartridges costing more to make than blu-ray media for the other consoles. Nintendo also didn't want a disparity of cost between physical media and digital media, so if you launch a game both ways, you need to have the price be the same, which creates higher costing digital games on the switch store vs any other platform. The cost of the cartridge also varies depending on size of the game, so larger games will suffer more to this than smaller ones.

That's my loaded opinion which turned more into a typed rant on the switch. Its still a pretty ok console that provides a ton of unique experiences that you can't get on any other platform. As a sole console I don't think I would recommend this unless you fully know what you are getting into, but as a side device to play exclusives its not bad. Hopefully they will release new hardware and software updates to fix many of the gripes I rambled on about.",positive
234,Video Games,Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‚ÄëCon,$299.99,5,"I used to play Nintendo 64 back in the day and now I have another Nintendo product that I love.

I play my Switch every single day. Mostly Animal Crossing at the moment, but I change it up sometimes. The only thing is the price of the games. They have sales all the time for various games on the shop but a lot of the bigger name games aren't included those. Or if they are the ""sale"" is pretty negligible.

The things I love the most about the Switch is that you can take it pretty much anywhere. To my friend's house when we hang out, on long car trips, outside, you name it. The other thing I love is how durable the system is. I have dropped it at least three times on hardwood floor and tile and it hasn't affected the performance at all.

The only thing I can say is that it's not as ergonomic as an Xbox or even a PS controller, so if you're playing for long stretches of time, your hand will cramp up.
I think that the biggest plus for me is how small this thing is - the entire console isn't much bigger than smartphones nowadays, and the games for it are half the size of DVDs.

242,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch,[],4,"Let me begin by saying Super Smash Bros. has always been a fighting game franchise I've held dear since my childhood. Each new entry seemed to completely raise the bar, thereby raising my expectations for what kind of surprises were in store for us. And as far as the character reveals go, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate boasted a good amount of surprises for the fans. Lots of heavily requested fighters such as King K. Rool, Ridley and Simon Belmont finally graced the roster. However, I just don't see how they can call this the ""Ultimate"" version of Smash when so much was taken out in exchange for a larger than normal stage and fighter number. So this brings me to the ultimate question (sorry for the overuse of the word ""ultimate"" btw). Was what we gained better than what we lost? That's a difficult question for me to answer. Instead, I'll just spill my thoughts. Let's continue with the review.

Part 1: Presentation. The formula of Super Smash Bros has remained relatively the same since its debut in 1999. Its control scheme is pretty unique for a fighting game. But, it works excellently. There are no 15-button combos, but a series of standard, special, and aerial attacks that can be used in whichever sequence you see fit. The objective of the game is to rack up damage on your opponents by beating them to a pulp using your wide variety of moves, items, assists etc. and then launching them off the stage. I simply adore the chaotic gameplay of Smash bros. and so do millions of people, hence the large fanbase. However, there are some people in this world who have never played a Smash game before (shocking, right?). I just feel the game could do a better job in presenting itself to newcomers. The ""how to play"" video doesn't show up until after the game's opening. How will people know to wait after the logo comes on the screen? Other than that, the menu is very clean and straightforward this time around. It only takes 3 button presses to get into a match with you and your buds. I also want to take this time and applaud the beautiful design of the menus. There is a nice mix between simplistic graphics and in-game images. It honestly deserves an award. Not only that, its easier than ever to add up to 8 players to a match, set up custom match rules and edit controller configurations. So much care went into making the experience pleasurable.

Part 2: Gameplay. Like I mentioned above, the gameplay of Smash Bros. remained the same. But, this time around, the overall speed has been upped a bit, making the gameplay a tad faster than Smash 4, but a tad slower than Melee. And I gotta say, it really feels great. Since the speed of the game changed, so did some of the animations of the fighters. Taunts, for instance, are quicker and don't leave you vulnerable for as long. And when you launch a fighter, they propel a lot faster and a lot farther. This makes it a bit harder to execute combos, sadly. Despite the faster gameplay, I am AMAZED at how fluid the movements of the fighters still are, as well as how nicely animated some of their new moves are. This game runs at a buttery-smooth 60 fps, despite all the chaos happening on the screen. I'd give this game an A+ in this department. It's not hard to understand why the gameplay of Smash hasn't changed. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Part 3: Content. This is where things get dicey. One could argue that having 70+ characters and 100+ stage options qualifies as a hefty amount of content. However,a lot-and I mean ALOT of the features/modes from the prior smash bros. games have been cut. I'm going to start by telling you what you get with this game. There is your standard ""Smash"" mode, which houses local multiplayer matches. Standard Smash is for 2-8 players. If you have an even larger group of people wanting to play, you'll be glad to know there's a tournament mode. A new multiplayer mode called ""squad strike"" makes its debut in this game. In this mode, you can challenge a buddy and both of you use a ""squad"" of 3 or 5 characters to participate in elimination-style matches. Other than that, you can also mess around with the rules in the multiplayer matches. The mode ""special"" smash makes a return. Playing this mode, will allow you to fight with a variety of battle parameters (make your fighter faint after taking a certain amount of damage, make your fighters large, make them metallic, etc). Next, we have ""Spirits mode"", which houses this game's campaign mode, ""World of Light"". This could take a while to wrap up, so i'll try to be brief. Those of you who are familiar with Smash Bros may remember collecting ""trophies"" which are in-game collectible 3D models of characters who are both in and not in the game. In prior games, there were tons of ways you could unlock trophies, which added hours upon hours of more content. In this game, trophies are gone, but their spirits are carried through...well, spirits. The whole gimmick of ""Spirits mode"" is fighting,collecting and leveling up spirits, which are obtained by completing matches with a plethora of wacky parameters. So, what are spirits? They're basically the souls of characters who appeared in various games. In this game, they're represented by flat 2D images, rather than 3D models like the trophies were. When you ""equip"" a spirit, you attain its powers, which in some way, are related to the spirit itself. In super smash bros. brawl for wii, you may remember ""stickers"", which are almost the exact same thing, but you can't level them up. The whole mechanic of ""spirits"" is fully brought into play in the ""World of Light"" campaign mode. This time around, a new foe named ""Galeem"" has reared his ugly head and claimed the bodies of all the fighters (except Kirby) and is making clones of them. To make these clones fight, he uses the spirits he claimed from non-important characters and embeds them into the clones so that they become animate. Your job is to rescue all of your fallen comrades and restore light to the world. In this mode, you traverse a large, and I mean LARGE map, taking on the clones (with spirits inside them) in a variety of silly matches. Should you beat the clone at their own game, you free the spirit within and you can use their powers to help you free more spirits. Spirits are leveled up naturally by fighting. The better you do in a fight, the more EXP your spirit gets. Playing a good match can also net you ""skill points"" which can be used to unlock extra stats on top of the ones you get with spirits. When you travel across the map, you will run into your comrades being held captive. If you defeat them in a regular match, you will free them and that means you not only get to use then in World of Light, but in every other mode in the game as well. Each section of World of Light's map has a boss. Defeat that boss and you're one step closer to confronting Galeem. Anyway, you keep going through the cycle of fighting,rescuing spirits,rescuing fighters and taking down bosses for the whole campaign mode. I have yet to complete this mode, but it goes on for a while. My gripe with ""World of Light"" is that it becomes repetitive after a while. These matches with the crazy battle parameters make up about 90% of the campaign and are, in theory, just matches that you can replicate by messing around with the rules in ""Smash mode"". This honestly feels like event matches with an unnecessary rpg mechanic slapped on it. Also, the difficulty is all over the place. Some matches are fairly easy and in others, you'll get your can kicked to and fro. Anyhoo, let's keep going. Next, we have ""Classic Mode"", which is no stranger to us Smash fans. In this mode, you select a character, take on a series of matches and fight a boss at the end. However, this classic mode is a bit different than the ""classic"" modes we're used to. And by ""different"", I mean worse. First off, classic mode has been shortened by like 5 matches. Second, there is only one bonus game that you play between matches, and its the same for every fighter and every difficulty you choose. It's a little obstacle course where you collect yellow orbs and race to the end before a black hole swallows you. I just don't understand why they couldn't have at least added different layouts for the obstacle course. In prior games, there were ""break the targets"" bonus stages that had multiple layouts. Lastly, classic mode ends with a boss. **SPOILER ALERT IN 3...2....1...(SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED)There are only 6 bosses in the game. And in a game with over 70 characters, this means you'll be fighting the same ones over and over. And lo and behold, these are the EXACT six bosses you'll fight in the campaign mode.

**SPOILERS OVER**Alright, next I want to cover the online mode. I knew from when it was first unveiled, it would be a mess and I was right. There is no longer the ""For fun"" and ""For Glory"" options that were in Smash Bros. for Wii U. There is only the Quickplay option in which you set your match preferences and HOPE you and another player have the same idea of a good match. More often than not, you will be forced to play in 4-player matches if you don't want to play 4-player matches and 1-on-1 matches when you don't feel like playing a 1-on-1. Also, there is noticeable lag (Oh boy, what a surprise) when playing online. Apparently, the game does its best to set you up against players close to you, but if one player has bad internet, everyone suffers.

Part 4(UPDATED AS OF AUGUST 2019):The Cutting Board. This is where I want to talk about features than many considered to be standard for Smash games, but for some reason, don't show up in Ultimate. My main problem with this game is that I feel Nintendo stripped the extra content and modes that made Smash Bros. a truly enjoyable experience, leaving behind what the game is at its core: a party fighting game. Nintendo seems to be on this trend lately with games like Mario Tennis Aces, ARMS, Star Fox Zero and Mario Kart 8, where modes that offered a great subsidiary to the main gameplay formula (multiplayer modes, mini game modes, battle modes etc) that were present in PAST TITLES are nowhere to be seen. And I absolutely HATE that Smash had to be a part of this trend. And this most disappointing part of this is that the Switch is Nintendo's 2nd HD game console. We should be getting games that absolutely push the boundaries of what past games were restricted to. Other developers are making their sequels bigger and better, but for some reason, Nintendo is holding back content from their games. It just doesn't make sense. It's as if whenever they take 1 step forward, they have to take 2 steps back. Sorry for the small rant, here are the features that Smash Ultimate lacks. First, mini-games like ""Break the Targets"", ""board the platforms"" and ""Home run contest"" are absent. I feel these games would have been PERFECT for an online leader board functionality. Second, Single player modes like ""All-star"" and ""event match"" are absent.
UPDATE: Stage Builder mode, which was a feature of the last 2 Smash games, was added via an update and it's amazing how much care went into designing the new components and objects you can play around with. This stage builder easily trumps the other two. Not only that, Tournament mode was added. I' ve decided to bump up my rating by one star to accommodate these additions. Thanks for listening to the fans, Mr. Sakurai.

Lastly, I want to talk about unlocking methods. You start the game with the original 8 characters that you started with in the Nintendo 64 game, yet all of the stages are unlocked. This baffling to me. In prior smash games, you would have to unlock stages and characters by completing certain requirements. Some of which were very unique and creative, making unlocking the character/stage a truly rewarding experience. With Ultimate, all of that is gone. You simply unlock characters by playing multiplayer matches, classic mode matches or via the ""World of Light"" campaign. If you want to bring back the nostalgic feel of putting effort towards unlocking something, you need to do it with the stages as well.

Part 5: The verdict: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a truly great game at its core. Its gameplay has even been tweaked and refined, further enhancing the experience. However, most of what you'll be doing in this game is playing standard matches, whether it be against a CPU or a few buddies. Many of us were looking forward to a fully fleshed-out adventure mode, but its basically a series of event matches-something we've seen before. And all of the great passtimes like home-run batting, trophy collecting,""break the targets"" or stage building are nowhere to be seen. And the one mode we do have that was present in past games, ""Classic"" mode has been watered down. By no means am I saying this is a terrible game. It's just that I was expected what added to the charm of Smash Bros. to be included in this installment. And I'm very well sure the developers know that we sometimes can't get everything we want. I don't feel ripped off, because there is very well $60 worth of content in this game. And with the addition of fan favorite characters like Banjo-Kazooie coming soon, I am very grateful to the dedication of the development team. Thanks for reading and happy gaming.",positive

252,Video Games,[4 Pack] iVoler Tempered Glass Screen Protector Designed for Nintendo Switch OLED Model 2021 with [Alignment Frame]Transparent HD Clear[Updated Version]Screen Protector for Nintendo Switch OLED 7'',$8.44,5,"Recently purchased a new Nintendo Switch OLED and a tempered glass screen protector was the very thing I had on my list to order. Gravitated to this kit because of the very handy alignment tool that‚Äôs included. Very easy to install and the alignment tool will aide me in future screen protector installs if and when needed. No issues with the touch screen functions at all. The 3rd - 5th pictures are with the screen protector already installed.

*Something to note for those who may be wondering. You will have to remove the Joy Cons to install the screen protector when using the alignment tool. It will only fit over the screen display. I‚Äôve included a picture (3rd) to show this as a reference.",positive

That said, the process for this was pretty much seamless. The application tray really took a lot of the stress out of ensuring that the screen protector lined up with the original OLED screen. Like anyone else, my fear was the no matter how many times I wiped down the screen, dust would inevitably collect rapidly. But in a semi-controlled environment and if timed properly, the process can be quick and painless. I used only one screen protector and the finished product turned out to be as good as anyone else who‚Äôs done it for me in the past. Truthfully, there are two tiny spots where the adhesive didn‚Äôt completely apply properly but since they‚Äôre off-screen, it doesn‚Äôt bother me enough to try again. üòÇü§£

All in all, the previous reviews and product description were accurate and I‚Äôm happy that I have three more screen protectors if need be.",positive

The multi pack gives me confidence against accidents or surprise dust particles- I can try again if I need to. Luckily I am satisfied the first time with extras for the future!

It does have actual corners, so no rounded missed sections. However it is not edge to edge. There is a gap on the sides but not part of the touch area.

Product defects happen and I wasn't going to install another one over this because it's on the outer boarder but I have a spot where something is embedded in the adhesive from the factory. Not something from me. I got all the dust off and any specks removed before leaving it affixed. Tried multiple times removing the spot but whatever it is it wouldn't come off.

To end on a positive note, the alignment tool made the install a breeze. For the price, getting 4 protectors and an alignment tool makes this a good value and recommendation to others.",positive

Those four times I struggled and had to reapply multiple times that a bunch of dust and bubbles would end up on the screen protector and I would just give up. There was one Instance where the protector cracked before I could even apply it on my Nintendo switch screen. Recently I upgraded to the OLED and I was worried I would struggle like before when I bought this product but it wasn‚Äôt the case,the packaging included extra screen protectors,wipes,dust remover,and the yellow plastic to use as a guide for application. It was so easy to apply the protector on my OLED and no dust or bubbles were left on my first try so I didn‚Äôt have to use any of the extra screen protectors included and I‚Äôm so happy.

262,Video Games,Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch,$54.47,5,"I been avid Kirby fan since SNES, called Super Family Computer back in my country. I have played almost every release of HAL Laboratory's pink creation, almost with passion. Kirby Superstar always was one of my favorite Nintendo 1st party title. But as I got older and I moved onto PS2 and GBA, fact Kirby stayed 2D even when Mario was getting 2.5 and 3D treatment was slowly baffling me.

Then, one day, for GameCube, a E3 demo surfaced. One that featured my favorite pink cute creature, running around saving Dream Land! I was awed! I loved it! I really wanted it! It would have given me reasons to buy GameCube, which I held off on, because I was getting distant from Zelda titles (which I still care 0 for), and only game I grew interest in became MGS Twin Snakes, which I highly recommend.

I waited forever for the title to release.

From 2005, we fast-forward, now we're here.

Now, I'm fully aware this game has been built from the scratch, not related to this beautiful game at all. And it's long been confirmed that the GCN and possible Wii edition that it may have existed all went in dumpster only after being in development hell for 11 years. BUT. YOU HAVE NO FREAKING IDEA HOW MUCH THE WORLD NEEDED THIS GAME. Every platformer copy steal ability game lands itself beautifully to our wonderful pinkball here.

And Kirby is here to rightfully take that back from you. Or suck it out of you.

Right out of the box, game plays short cutscene and there's 0 punch holding. You're taken straight into the tutorial, reminded of the familiar controls.

And then WHAT?! I CAN BE A CAR KIRBY NOW?!

And the area can beautifully demolishable just as how previous Kirby games have been, has platform area that you can fall and oof into, just as previous Kirby games have been, but this formula finally got re-perfected in the name of our Holy Pinkness finally fit for the generation that only knows Kirby as that Super Smash Bros. character that is annoying to fight against.

Now I will add back that I have only been playing for about 1h, but this new game almost plays like a journey. You're finding out conspiracy on how you ended up in this Forgotten Land, accompanied by beautiful Japanese song (that probably is definitely the first one!), great orchestra-based OST, and did I mention that Car Kirby is freaking adorable? I heard he has few or form and I'm very eager to find out rest of them.

If you're long fan of older Kirby titles, I am wondering why you're reading my reviews instead of already snagging this title. It feels like nothing new for first few minutes, but that's some of the beauty of the Kirby series. The gameplay feels like something you can jump back into almost any time, even if you haven't played Kirby game since Kirby Superstar. But there's enough new tricks introduced to keep you busy and wondering around the new Forgotten Land for good few hours. Considering last Kirby title was fairly short and took me only about 3 days of casual play to get near 100% completion, I'm hoping this one has far more to offer, which it already has. If you played a lot of platformer, this new Kirby title will keep you busy some time, it got some easy puzzles and here and there moment of ""wait why is that there?!"" moments.

I think I mentioned Car Kirby is freaking cute already? Lol.

So far, 100/100. I haven't had so much fun with games lately, and this one definitely hits the spot. I love you Kirby. And please don't let my spouse find out I'm cheating on them over Kirby.",positive
263,Video Games,Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch,$54.47,5,"I am a huge Kirby fan and have been with the series since 2002. I was left somewhat disappointed with Kirby Star Allies as I felt it was lacking in some key areas. It felt like a decent game however one that played things overly safe. With Kirby and the Forgotten Land HAL Labs have finally made the leap into 3d and it's better than I could have ever imagined.

Kirby controls excellently in 3d. Everything has been adapted into 3d in a way that feels natural. The camera is mostly fixed with some minor angling that can be done by the player. The levels themselves are consistently creative and enjoyable to play. There's a load of additional content ranging from mini games to the bonus treasure road stages in each world. The music is also fantastic! These are some of my favorite level and boss themes in the series thus far.

In terms of complaints I only have a few and they're minor at best. The game runs at 30fps. It's a stable framerate however it is disappointing when compared to other games on the switch that are more technically demanding and run at higher framerates. In addition objects that are not immediately in your vicinity are rendered at half the framerate which wouldn't be an issue if the game ran at 60fps. It's just jarring to see enemies and items rotating at a choppy 15fps and on the whole it's a tad disappointing given how good the rest of the game looks.

Secondly the number of powers is fairly small. There are only 12 which is less than the typical Kirby game which has around 20-25. The saving grace is that abilities can be upgraded which makes a lot of them feel unique. There's also some surprising omissions in terms of copy abilities such as no Wheel, Parasoul, Spark, Beam or Fighter.

Lastly I wish that the worlds had just a few more stages. Most worlds have on average 4 stages with a few containing 5 excluding the boss stages. The levels themselves are fantastic but I guess I'm being a little greedy because I wish there were a few more.

Overall this is an easy recommendation. I think those looking for a relaxing platforming adventure will enjoy this a lot. Anyone on the fence can always try out the free demo for this game located on the Nintendo Switch E-Shop. I love Kirby as a series and I can't wait to see what HAL Labs does next!",positive
264,Video Games,Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch,$54.47,5,"After several decades Kirby has finally gotten his first true 3D Platformer and I am glad to say it is amazing. The level design and gameplay are top notch, rivaling even Mario Odyssey in quality. It feels like a natural succession for Kirby as the game is broken up into several small levels with plenty of collectables. Add in some vibrantly colorful level, adorable enemy designs, the wackiness of mouthful mode and you got a truly memorable game. If I have one suggestion it is to use the dodge roll, it saved more than a few times late into the game.

If you had told me I'd would be cheering at screen over a Kirby game. I would have brushed you off earlier this year. And yet towards the end of the game that's exactly what I found myself doing. It's a moment you have to experience for yourself. If you like 3D Platformers this is a must play. Kirby and the Forgotten Land is easily a contender for game of the year for 2022. -MickManga",positive
