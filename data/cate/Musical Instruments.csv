0,Musical Instruments,Ernie Ball Hybrid Slinky Electric Guitar Strings 3-Pack - 9-46 Gauge (P03222),$4.89 - $50.15,5,"This was my first time using Ernie Ball strings and I can say they are great. I like .09 because of some arthritis in my hands, and these are easier for me to squeeze and play.
I tried some .10s a while back, but they weren’t as comfortable.
These 3 packs are affordable and convenient when you have a few guitars, or when you order from overseas, like in my case, and you don’t find them available near you.",positive
1,Musical Instruments,Ernie Ball Hybrid Slinky Electric Guitar Strings 3-Pack - 9-46 Gauge (P03222),$4.89 - $50.15,5,"I've tried many strings for my electric guitars. I always go back to Ernie Ball Slinky. If you regularly wipe down your strings after playing, they keep their tone for a very looooong time. Plus, they take my continuous stretching abuse without breaking on me.",positive
2,Musical Instruments,Ernie Ball Hybrid Slinky Electric Guitar Strings 3-Pack - 9-46 Gauge (P03222),$4.89 - $50.15,5,"I switched from regular 10-46 strings on my Les Paul and SG to these. The thicker lower strings make chugging a little easier because the string doesn't flop around as much. They're still easy to bend as well. Tuning is pretty stable, but I never had an issue with lighter strings.",positive
3,Musical Instruments,Ernie Ball Hybrid Slinky Electric Guitar Strings 3-Pack - 9-46 Gauge (P03222),$4.89 - $50.15,5,"I’ve been using these strings for I can’t remember. They are reliable, great tone and sound. I highly recommend them for new guitar players for many reasons. One reason would be when looking for strings for your sound, they are great to compare to. They sound good for any style of music.

If you like heavy strings they are not for you",positive

I decided to try this new offering from Ernie Ball to see if I might be able to lessen the pain I experience while playing. They made an incredible difference! I put them on my Telecaster and I must say that in addition to helping my fingers, they have a great sound. I can even do bends and vibratos now! I am going to buy a few more sets to put on my Gretsch and Strat. Highly recommended!",positive

30,Musical Instruments,Amazon Basics Guitar Folding A-Frame Stand for Acoustic and Electric Guitars,$17.95 - $25.95,5,"I bought one of these to keep my inexpensive parlor guitar at hand, and it works well, and the access increases impromptu practice sessions, my goal. Due to the mixed reviews, I looked it over with a critical eye when it arrived. Noticed it has brads, which I'm not fond of, but took another look, and the brads look sturdy and well-seated. It's neither structural nor mechanical, and I think it will stand up fine to the intended use: to sit on the floor and hold a guitar. I jiggled it a bit to see if the guitar would drop off, and even picked it up by the base and leaned it forward, and it has to lean a bit for the guitar to fall, bearing in mind that mine is a bottom-heavy, 12-fret-to-the-body, small guitar. I'm still attentive about where in the room I position it, but so far, I'm happy with it. I also like that it's close to the (carpeted) floor, so a fall is unlikely to be disastrous. Would I trust it with my $45K WWII D-28? No, but not a problem as I don't have one.
Yesterday I had the guitar on my bed and the stand empty, and wanted to set my bodhran down, and without thinking about it, placed it on the at-hand stand, where it sat like the stand was made for the purpose. Since I had been actively seeking options for resting places (leaving in case or under a shelf rejected on the out-of-sight-out-of-mind principle; on top of a book case rejected because cats and gravity), this seemed serendipitous. I picked up the stand, tried the tilt test, and it clung with tenacity. Foam rest at top and on legs protected the wood. I looked up options for purpose-built bodhran stands, and decided to buy another of these, since they can then be used interchangeably for either instrument, and I was already knew what I was getting. This bodhran is a 14.6 x 5.5 inches/6 (38 x 14 cm), and it looks custom-built for the purpose.
In reference to the snarkilicious Q&A's about whether this stand is cat-friendly, I noticed that my stand had tooth marks in the foam supports which hold the body of the guitar at the base. It was me or the cats, and I would remember, so I speculate that a cat or cats and the stand were getting *very* friendly at some point.",positive
31,Musical Instruments,Amazon Basics Guitar Folding A-Frame Stand for Acoustic and Electric Guitars,$17.95 - $25.95,5,"I have no idea who initially invented this style of guitar stand, but this is a great price for a well made copy. The stand opens to three different positions to fit a wide variety of body sizes. The foam arms are designed to work well with body solid body electrics and acoustic guitars. This is replacing a Fender branded folding stand I've used for about 20 years. It's bulkier (will not fit into a gig bag unless it has HUGE pockets) and heavier but is far more sturdy. It folds nicely into a shape that works as a handle for carrying it. I first saw one at a rehearsal space I was at and after seeing the price I ordered one immediately. HIghly recommended if looking for a compact stand for gigging.",positive
32,Musical Instruments,Amazon Basics Guitar Folding A-Frame Stand for Acoustic and Electric Guitars,$17.95 - $25.95,5,Compact stand. Very sturdy. I don't know if it fits all guitar bodies as well as it fits my Telecaster. I still prefer the neck support on a stand but for travel etc. this is perfect. The top rest is right on the neck plate on a Telecaster may be on the body on other shaped guitars. Still a really good product.,positive

34,Musical Instruments,Amazon Basics Guitar Folding A-Frame Stand for Acoustic and Electric Guitars,$17.95 - $25.95,5,"Very impressive stand. Accommodates my simple 6-string Ibanez acoustic guitar. Protective foam on the cradle part of the stand keeps scratches from happening. Not sure about the longevity, but at the price paid replacing the stand would not be break the budget.

UPDATE: So impressed with the first one, I gladly bought a second. They are really well made.",positive

38,Musical Instruments,Amazon Basics Guitar Folding A-Frame Stand for Acoustic and Electric Guitars,$17.95 - $25.95,5,I purchased one of these and liked it so much I bought another one. This is a great guitar stand for the price. It can be adjusted for different size guitars and is very sturdy. The boy thing that would make this better is a rubber latch to keep the guitar a little safer but I have not had any issues without it,positive
39,Musical Instruments,Amazon Basics Guitar Folding A-Frame Stand for Acoustic and Electric Guitars,$17.95 - $25.95,4,"These stands are OK. Build is good. They sit sturdy. They hold a normal sized Acoustic guitar very nicely. MY issue is the way an Electric sits in it... it leans too far back, for Me... taking up the room I ""thought"" I would be saving with such a small guitar stand. My ""hanging"" style guitar stand can be located much closer to a wall or an amp than this little stand, because of the angle an electric guitar sits in it.",positive
40,Musical Instruments,Amazon Basics XLR Male to Female Microphone Cable,$9.95 - $28.23,5,"Purchased these xlr cables to connect my studio monitors. And I must say they look great. Haven't connected them yet but my first impression is they look like high quality cables. I felt confident in buying Amazon Basics brand because not that long ago I purchased a couple of rca cables of that brand and they were perfect, still running them today on my home theater set up. I only wish I had looked into Amazon brand cables before I bought a set of really expensive Monster cables a while back. Spent $70 for the pair and they look identical to these ones which cost a total of $20 shipped. Oh, and these are longer! I got the 15 foot long cables just to insure I'd have enough slack to play with for speaker placement. Will only be buying AB for my cable needs from now on! I feel like such a doof for spending that much money on Monster cables, they all do the same thing, transfer audio.",positive

50,Musical Instruments,OneOdio headphones-Pro-10,$31.99 - $35.99,5,"First off, if you have problems with sound only in one ear, you are using the wrong cord! I was getting frustrated because these would sound great one second, then the cord would move, and it would cut out in one ear. I was using the black cord, with 1/8"" plugs on both ends. This cord is intended for use with the microphone, so it has 3 bands (stereo/mic) on the plug instead of 2 (stereo). It will work sometimes, but it will cut out and be frustrating. For music listening only, use the red cord, and plug the 1/4"" plug into the same size jack on the left headphone. Voila, no more cutting out!

As for sound quality, I was pretty pleased. I am using these plugged into an electronic drumset, and the drums were loud and full. Plugged my phone in and drummed along with music, and the music sounded great along with the e-drums. I'd say there's not a ton of high-end, mainly mids and some decent bass - quality sound but maybe not for a true audiophile (which I'm not).

The cans were comfortable and light enough after wearing for a while. The frame is not exactly form-fitting, you do look a little goofy with these on as the frame extends from your head like a big antenna. But who's looking? I'd say these are pretty good headphones for a decent price.",positive
51,Musical Instruments,OneOdio headphones-Pro-10,$31.99 - $35.99,5,"I have ""0"" knowledge about headphones so I rely on reviews and a visit to the seller's web-site for help with my decision 95% of the time. I've only had this headset for a few days but I watched a movie last night and the voices were crystal clear. Tried watching the same movie last week and gave up after 15 minutes- voices- were so muffled I had no idea what was being said. The background music is not so overwhelming that the viewer just watches the action.... ""hand me a blankie and pillow, please!"".
I think the OneOdie Studio Pro 10 is a quality product and well worth the price. Because it's not in the $200-$300 range doesn't make it a toy. If you spent your money on it, treat it with R-E-S-P-E-C-T.
Based on my limited knowledge, I would highly recommend this headset. Maybe I'm just got lucky!",positive
52,Musical Instruments,OneOdio headphones-Pro-10,$31.99 - $35.99,5,"I have a HP laptop with speakers that are less than desirable. Compound this with a lifetime of audio problems, (hard of hearing), and the speakers are pretty much useless. A set of cheap computer/desktop speakers were purchased with good results as they had a separate volume control plus a jack for headphones/earbuds. Having a small desk, It was getting crowded between the laptop, the speakers and the desk light, compounded by the fact that the whole set up is against a wall that goes out to a common hallway. This restricts my volume as I don't need to have anyone hearing what I'm doing while I am online. Thus the purchase of these headphones.
I chose headphones over earbuds as my ears easily get irritated when something is inserted. My main concern was two fold. The first is I have a large head, (size 7 5/8) and past ear protection devices have been pretty much uncomfortable both against the ears and overall. The second is perspiration as sweat build up occurs after extended wear. Being quite a while since I wore headphones, (2012) I did note an improvement but was still a bit gun shy.
To be honest, these were not my first choice. I initially saw a set of DJ headphones with a 9' cord which appealed to me for freedom of movement. For whatever reason, these were ordered instead.
These headphones came 4 days after ordering through standard, free shipping. Arriving in a soft pack with a bubble lining, the headphones were in a box enclosed within a sleeve. This made unwrapping a bit of a challenge as I wanted to save the box in case of return. Finally gaining entry, the headphones were in a bubble wrapped bag and two sets of wiring were enclosed within another. It was then I realized my error. Throwing caution to the wind, I took them out and read the enclosed the multi language manual. This was helpful as it was discovered that the ear pieces work somewhat like a person's neck. One side rotating 90 degrees counter clockwise and the other 90 degrees clockwise. Both tilted both up and down and both have extenders to adjust to the wearer. Also noted was the padding. Both ear pieces had generous padding as well as the top of the head set. It was nice to note that both sides of the ear pieces had outlets to accomodate the speaker wires. This makes it easier to plug the side in from the source thus avoiding crossover.
Two sets of wires came. The first was a red, stretchable cord with a 6.5mm plug for items like guitars and speakers on one end and a 3mm plug for the head set. The cord is 2m long but can be stretched to 3m. The second cord is a 1.2m standard cord with 3mm plugs on both ends. There is also a ""control"" button should the wearer have the headphones plugged into a phone.
Assembling the pieces, I plugged the 3mm into the cheap speakers and ran a gauntlet of various apps from music to gaming. WOW! WOW! WOW! A full, rich, clear sound was experienced through both earpieces despite the plug being on the right side. Every sound was heard, no matter how subtle. I did note, however, it was a bit ""bassy"" for my preference, but I was completely overwhelmed by the sound quality. Wondering if maybe the speakers may have some influence, I plugged the headset directly into the laptop. NOPE! No change in quality and I gained a little more cord in the process.
After playing for about two to three hours, It was pleasantly noted that the only time it was noted the headset was on was when I reached up to my head to scratch. Very lightweight, snug, yet comfortable even with glasses. No sweat experienced. No discomfort against the ears or atop the head. The cheap speakers were then moved and attached to another device that also had less than desirable speakers. It is unknown about the noise cancellation as the residence is pretty quiet with the exception of others going up and downstairs as well as the upstairs resident. Time will tell.
These are definately a keeper. Even though I have owned these less than a day, I am totally impressed with the looks, feel, and performance of these headphones. Definately a keeper and highly recommended!!!!
04/29/2019 update. These have almost constantly on my head and I have made a couple observations. 1. Despite being ""full"" ear headphones, they are not sound blocking. On a couple of occasions, I have been hearing knocking on my door as well as the phone ringing and someone talking, even though I couldn't understand what was spoken. Both have originated about 20 feet away. 2. the head band has a tendency to slide forward towards the forehead. I haven't figured out why yet and will post when I do. Right now I am testing a couple of theories.",positive
53,Musical Instruments,OneOdio headphones-Pro-10,$31.99 - $35.99,5,"I have these on right now.
They're good headphones. Big and bulky, yes, but good sounding—better sounding than my AirPod Pros, even. These get LOUD. The bass on this isn't jaw shattering, but still pretty good. They're not noise cancelling, but they filter out noise pretty well, so I guess you could say they're noise isolating.
I will say, though, that music bleeds through these headphones pretty bad (if you play your music at too loud a volume, people next to you will hear what you're listening to). I don't mind, though, since I'll mostly be using these at home to thoroughly enjoy my music :)",positive
54,Musical Instruments,OneOdio headphones-Pro-10,$31.99 - $35.99,5,"I wear a size 8+ fitted cap. My head is the reason that single size hats say ""one size fits most"". As such, it's nearly impossible to find over ear headphones that are both comfortable on my ears and durable enoungh that I'm not worried they're going to break anytime I put them on my head. These fit me perfectly, and I can wear them for hours without even realizing I'm wearing them. As an added bonus, the sound quality is great. I've had better sound quality from headphones that were comfortable for my huge cranium, but I paid nearly four times what these cost me. Overall the ratio of quality, cost, and fit for big heads is better than I've found anywhere.",positive
55,Musical Instruments,OneOdio headphones-Pro-10,$31.99 - $35.99,5,"The quality is quite good. But I think it is important to say that my girlfriend's ears are quite small--these are perfectly comfortable on her, but not on me. Personally I need a more oval-shaped ear cup. Fortunately, they were for her! She is using them for editing video that has narration, sometimes music, etc.
But yeah, headphones are high quality, and so are the cords that come with them. I like how the main cord is mostly straight, but has a coiled springy section. That allows it to reach a good ways if necessary, but also the comfort of the springy part...it's hard to explain, but it lets you move around comfortably in your chair without feeling the weight of the full cord pulling your head down. Nice product, great price too.",positive
56,Musical Instruments,OneOdio headphones-Pro-10,$31.99 - $35.99,4,"I'm taking a long trip and I wanted a set of wired headphones so I won't have to wait for my earbuds to charge up. I didn't want to spend a lot of money for this one trip. So, I found these and after some research picked them up. When I first used them, I immediately thought I have to return because the sound was horrible. But I tried them again the next day and I can't say how surprised I was at how good they sounded. I mean the sound was awesome. The highs are not tinny, the mids are clear and the bass is balanced. It comes with a 1/4 and 1/8 inch cords. I'm no audiophile but I am a musician who has recorded with nice professional headphones. For the price, I'm recommending these all day.",positive
57,Musical Instruments,OneOdio headphones-Pro-10,$31.99 - $35.99,5,"So as far as sound, these are best sounding headphones I've owned. In comparison to the MS Surface headphones, these have fuller bass without compromising the treble. The plastic though for holding the speakers in looks incredibly cheap. Nothing has broken on it though and I use them almost every day taking them off and on. I am just very gentle with them in case the cheap look results in an unwanted mishap. All in all an excellent deal if you want affordable great quality sound.",positive
58,Musical Instruments,OneOdio headphones-Pro-10,$31.99 - $35.99,4,"I'm no expert audiophile or anything of that sort, but these sound really good! Pleasant bass, good overall balance, keep a great amount (but not all) sound out, and most importantly they fit REALLY nice. The hinges are actually smooth and durable unlike many budget headphones, and the ear space is spacious yet comfortable. It even fits my slightly-too-big head!

Warning though, the second time I ordered these I got sent a pair of A71s instead. Make sure the pair you get look the same on the box!",positive
59,Musical Instruments,OneOdio headphones-Pro-10,$31.99 - $35.99,4,"I bought these in a pinch because a pair of Shure headphones I had stopped working and I gotta say I'm glad I did. For the price these are amazing. Comfortable and great response. The only reason I'm giving it 4 and not 5 stars is because it's a little bass-y at lower volumes and the cord it comes with (1/8"" headphone to 1/4"") is a little wonky. However, you can replace that cord if you have one you prefer lying around.

70,Musical Instruments,Fender Flash Guitar Tuner (239971000),$8.99 - $29.99,5,"I have had several other tuners over the years.

The Fender tuner is a little bit bigger than some of the other tunes and has a folding hinge rather than a ball joint. I tried another tuner and the Fender tuner at the same time on a Fender Stratocaster and a Squier Telecaster. Both read the same as far as tuning goes. The Fender tuner is brighter and easier to read. Both look clunky and are visually awkward attached to the headstock. The Fender having a rechargeable battery is nice, but once it quits charging, it will have to be tossed in the trash. I prefer replaceable batteries to built-in; however, only time will tell.

I have a pedal tuner on my pedalboard, tuners built into amps, other brand of clip-ons, and apps on my phone. My go-to for convenience is typically a clip-on tuner.",positive

88,Musical Instruments,"Fender 351 Shape Premium Picks (12 Pack) for electric guitar, acoustic guitar, mandolin, and bass",$2.00 - $52.48,5,"This is the old reliable for me. I'd say that a pic is a personal choice, that depends on the size of your hands & fingers, and the kind of tone you get when you play. In other words, there isn't a right or wrong, so much, but it's more a matter of personal preference and taste. I'd also say that, as long as your strings aren't buzzing, and sounding ""bad"", then it's ok to get whatever you want. But please, don't just tear off a piece of cardboard, it sounds terrible, buy a pic, they are super cheap, so no excuses. Then we can hear you play instead of the embarassing cardboard! This Fender Heavy pic is my favorite pic that I use all the time.

I just tried a whole bunch of different types of pics in the last couple months, since I thought I'd see what's out there, and see if there's something new out there for me. I ended going right back to these, my old reliable choice, that I've used since I was in high school, and ordered a new batch, because they really are the most comfortable for my small hands, and I like the sound, it's a clear, crisp, and not too muddy, nor overwhelming sound that these pics produce in my hands. I've used these Fender Heavy pics on my acoustic guitars for the last 40 years.

Pics are easy to lose, and so I got a little Pic holder, which I'm really liking, since it helps to not drop the pics into a black hole. Some accessories truly are worthwhile, while others are unnecessary, the pic holder is a very cheap bargain, like $2-5, you can get them at your favorite music store, retail or online, that is proving to be useful. Instead of dropping the pic I'm using, I put it in the pic holder instead, since when I'm playing, I switch between finger picking without a pic, and strumming with a pic, it's a ripe time for dropping pics into the black holes of the front yard, or under the couch etc. The pic holder is helping me keep track of that pic.

The Fender Heavy pics are nice and sturdy in my fingers, and I don't like the lighter kinds (including the Fender, and other brand's, lights & mediums) that ended up flying out of my hands when I'm playing, and they sounded tinnier, & more like a bad piece of cardboard, instead of a quiet, unnoticeable pic sound, or the professional pic sounds that pop out, now and then, and is perfectly ok to have. I'd say the biggest thing about returning to these pics is the fit feels perfect in my hand and fingers, I don't have any issues holding it. It's solid, and nothing but solid, in my hands. Doesn't slip around while I play, as some other kinds did. And it makes, no cardboard, no plasticky yucky sound, just the strings come through like a clear song. That's it. It feels great, and it sounds good to great. Simple & reliable.

Your choice may be completely different with your hands & fingers. Keep in mind also what you want for your criteria, like a loud or soft sound, and you'll find the best pic brands & styles for you. I do recommend trying a variety, just to see what one likes best. They are cheap, so for $25 you can try a wide variety. Some people do use different pics for different kinds of guitars and different songs. You can read all about that as well, I did too, and found it fascinating to read, and watch, what my favorite stars use, and why. Dave Matthews, Pete Townshend, and other stars I love use a variety of pics for different sonic effects. But in the end, for me, I found out that all I really like, and need, is the old reliable Fender Heavy pics, for my Yamaha Eterna acoustic guitar.",positive

100,Musical Instruments,HyperX QuadCast - USB Condenser Gaming Microphone,$89.99 - $242.60,5,"I have been hesitant on buying a desk mic. I mainly use a headset. One I have is a wired Astro but it was def not worth the money in my book. I had looked over several desk mics and was down to two but after watching a review comparing the two mics i was interested in, this one won.

I did stream at one time and those who would watch me never complained about the sounds quality though I know in my heart I wanted better. This def sounds way better than my Astro and i paid a lot for that overly hyped plastic. Now i just need to rebuy a headset I use to have that had eargasmic sound for far less than most headsets and I will be set.

I have two Pteranodons in my house (kids) or at least thats what my friends call them. They fight with each other or scream from jump scare games on the other end of the house. If I didnt have Nvidia rtx voice running, the would def come through even with settings in discord to try and help eliminate background noise. My friends love it though cause my kids yelling and fighting with each other they think is the funniest thing.

Well today one of my kids was in the same area as my desk and he was yelling loudly tattle telling on his brother, and I thought for sure he was coming through on this mic. I asked my friend if she heard anything or any of the kids and she said no. I was shocked. He was super super loud. Again I have used Nvidia rtx voice with 3 past headsets and my kids somehow would come through at times. If they were close it would be minimum but if they are in their room on the very far end of the house they would faintly come through. With this mic he was right on the the backside of my desk, though its set to Cardioid. But i do have a wall further back behind me and I can hear his voice bouncing off that wall when he is yelling in the room I am in, but he still did not come through. My friend heard nothing. If he was directly next to me then maybe he would come through. I wont know till I get a chance to test it out later. But so far the mic is worth it. Boyfriend liked it so much while he was helping to test listen for me in discord that he bought one for himself the next day.",positive
101,Musical Instruments,HyperX QuadCast - USB Condenser Gaming Microphone,$89.99 - $242.60,5,"The HyperX Quadcast S is a pretty banger mic. Out of the box, it sounds better than the Blue Yeti and is substantially less bulky looking as well. The materials don't seem as up to par as the Blue Yeti either however it's still pretty solid and you aren't going to wind up breaking it anytime soon. The mic works with Hyper X software and you are able to customize the RGB and these customizations have a lot of variety. There isn't however any in-built software for the Hyper X like there is for the Blue Yeti when it comes to things like EQ. However, this doesn't take away from the sound quality and I would say that due to it not relying on EQ software like the Blue Yeti it sounds much more natural and crisper. Though without any EQ software it is really hard to adjust the gain so as to not pick up stuff like keyboard typing and fan noises. Though I managed to mitigate this problem by downloading the Nvidia broadcast software and setting my input as my Razer Kraken V3 Pro mic and the output as the Hyper X microphone. Then whether it be in-game or discord or something just set the mic input as Nvidia broadcast and the output as your headset. It fixes the gain problem completely. Seriously. Nvidia broadcast is amazing. You could probably put a garden fan right beside you and it wouldn't be picked up. The HyperX Quadcast S also comes with a mic stand and a mic arm mount adapter. I personally would recommend getting a mic arm for this as the mic stand that comes with it tends to pick up a lot of vibrations from your desk. Overall this is a really quality mic that holds its own weight and is best comparable to the Blue Yeti but with RGB.",positive
102,Musical Instruments,HyperX QuadCast - USB Condenser Gaming Microphone,$89.99 - $242.60,5,"The Quadcast S is a fully featured USB microphone from HyperX. It could serve in almost any situation with selectable polar patterns. Most likely it will be used as a Condenser style pickup, but has 4 total styles to choose from. I experienced some initial feedback when I first tested the microphone, something of a traditional condenser hiss that a lot of USB microphones tend to have. I initially used Nvidia's Broadcast software to remove this noise, which worked very well. However, I had bought a new USB-C to C cable, and after using that to hook the microphone to my PC, I turned off Broadcast and the hiss was gone!

The HyperX NGENUITY software is easy to use for setting up the microphone. It has some simple volume controls for the main pickup, monitoring and headphone output as you can use it as a soundcard if you so desire. There are also controls for the fully featured RGB lighting. There are several styles of lighting to choose from, each with their own levels of customization. I went with a setup that has random colored ""lighting"" strikes coming down from the top of the mic, and comboed with a VU meter that lights up from the bottom when I talk.

The microphone comes with its own stand for easy use right out of the box, but it easily attached right to my mic arm for suspension use. I also added a wind screen. Overall this microphone is excellent and a definite top choice for streamers that want something that has some vibes going on.",positive
103,Musical Instruments,HyperX QuadCast - USB Condenser Gaming Microphone,$89.99 - $242.60,4,"If you’re an average daily gamer this will be plenty fine for you as long as you know how to work sound settings. The hardware and your own software take a bit if tweaking to get this mic into a good spot, but once you do it because a seamless part of your gaming experience.

I swapped to this over using a high-end headset like I have for the last 6 years, and I can definitely tell there was a drop in mic quality. The background noise isn’t an issue at all which is a sign of a good mic, but the clarity of my voice has definitely gone a bit down.

That being said, the quality is still pretty good and is definitely enough for gaming communications over something like Discord. However if you are trying to be a high-end streamer or Youtuber and you need the best quality audio, well then this is NOT for you.

There are other things I like about this mic, like the aux port directly on the mic, the gain control knob on the bottom of the mic, the easy mute button on the top of the mic, etc. Plenty of good features to love with this product. Just know that this is a consumer-grade mid-tier microphone, so don’t go in with unrealistic expectations and you’ll be satisfied.",positive

First off, you will not have some functionality on the level above this in the HyperX on a MAC. That is exactly why I chose this model. Second, you will really have to pay attention to the GAIN and your system intake. It REALLY matters here. That being said, once you get all the settings right, this mic IS TOTALLY AWESOME.

MAJOR WARNING - This microphone kept disconnecting and dying the DAY I bought it. After some online research (not tech support) It seems that the RGB was drawing too much power and disconnecting (as well as my keyboard which is new). Reddit tells me it is drawing too much power from the motherboard, maybe some of you know what this means.

I had to turn down the brightness in the HyperX software but now it works perfectly fine. I'm happy with the product I own but a little confused as a basic consumer why I had this issue. Also consider whether you really need the RGB.",positive

So depending on which way you're turning it, the screw will start to loosen and the thing will wobble and fall off! (I certainly wouldn't call it a ""Pro"" winder -- more of an amateur's tool.)

150,Musical Instruments,Elixir Strings Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings w NANOWEB Coating,$16.99 - $56.01,5,"I had a buddy tell me that I had to try these. He said that they easily last twice as long as normal strings, and they sound better the longer you play them.

Turns out, he was right. The reason why is because the coating used to protect the strings does dull the sound a little bit. and you don't truly get a true feel for what they can sound like until they're really broken in. I'm not sure if that's a good thing. Just don't change your strings right before a show. They do last twice as long, though, and even out-of-the-package, they sound better than most other strings I've tried.

I typically used Martin strings before mostly because I felt that if Martin makes such awesome guitars, they must make Martin strings to go with them. The strings I usually purchased where the Martin Authentic Lifespan 2.0.

I personally own two Taylors and a Takamine acoustic, and most folks know that Taylors come stock with Elixir strings. Personally, I think that's because it helps Taylor sell guitars.

When I was playing the Martin next to the Taylor at the music store, I preferred the sound of the Taylor. It was strong in the mids, subdued but still bright in the highs, and they had a wonderfully subdued bass sound that you could feel more than you could hear. The Martin seemed more well rounded, but the Taylor stood out because it rang out much longer.

I think it was the strings, and I didn't realize this until knowingly changing from my normal Martin strings to the Elixers on my guitars at home. Three guitars all produced superior results for different reasons. On my old Takamine workhorse, the Elixir strings produced a lot more sustain from a fairly weak sounding guitar. I was used to having to plug it in if I wanted people to be able to hear the guitar over my singing, and that became no longer necessary. On my Taylor Mini, the Elixirs greatly reduced the clinky sound strumming made, which was overwhelming with the Martin strings. This was the most noticeable difference. The Mini sounded really bad with the Martin strings by comparison.

On my baby, though, that punch from the bass that you can feel more than you can hear has returned.

It doesn't sound like it produces a very loud sound, but that sound carries a long way. I love singing with it. It's the only guitar of the three where I can actually hear the strings ring out loud enough to harmonize my voice with them, and I am truly in love with that feeling.

I wasn't able to attain that nearly to the same degree with the Martin strings.

The other thing that I want to point out is that these seem to be easier to tune, and they stay in tune. usually, when I first string a guitar, I like to strum around a little bit and then retune. I've been finding that with these strings, I don't have to. Plus, it's actually kind of strange if I pick it up and it's out of tune. I truly believe the strings have something to do with that.",positive

They sounded great and I was impressed, but my guitar (Garrison G40) still just sounded ""thin"" is the only way I can think to describe it. I was starting to think that maybe that's just the way it sounds, until I started looking into the differences between 80/20 and PB strings. I decided to give these a try now that I know more about the difference, and WOW. They gave me the richer, warmer and ""deeper"" sound I was chasing.

163,Musical Instruments,Vandoren larinet Traditional Reeds Strength,$23.99 - $60.99,5,"As any clarinet player would agree, the most important aspect of producing a quality sound is the combination of a player’s mouthpiece, embouchure, and reed. The central anchor to any combination is the reed, without a quality reed the other two factors are heavily affected and your sound suffers. This leads to the search for the best reed possible, a task made difficult by the numerous options between brands, strengths, and styles. The enormous variety of options can leave beginners unsure of where to begin. Vandoren reeds end that search by providing a reed that gives you a superior tone, and ability to control your volume, without taking away your control and detracting from your range.
Vandoren is a large company with plenty of experience in this field, so you can trust that the product you receive will be of a quality make and produce a quality sound. I have ordered reeds from them for several years now, and I have never experienced a problem with the packaging. Each box always arrives sealed, along with the individual reeds inside being sealed as well. While every reed manufacturer seals their reeds in a unique way, I believe Vandoren has the best technique. The package is easy to open and remove the reed from, yet still durable enough that you can store the reeds in the plastic covers they come in if you do not use a reed case.
Not only is the packaging Vandoren uses great, but the reeds themselves are manufactured well. All of Vandoren’s reeds are made from quality cane, with precise and flawless cuts. I have not seen a Vandoren reed come out of the package chipped, nor have I seen them cracked. All of Vandoren’s reeds are cut using a “French file cut” as opposed to a regular cut that their competitors use. While this cut may cause the price to rise a few dollars, it allows the reed to produce a faster response time a darker, fuller tone. Each reed that comes out of the box has a clean “U” shaped cut that you can clearly see. When held up to the light any reed, no matter the brand, should possess certain qualities. When held up to light you should clearly see a “V” shape going from the tip of the reed to the edge of the cut. Most Vandoren reeds have this “V” centered, exactly where it should be. Every Vandoren reed is also guaranteed to be cut so that the grain of the cane is even, resulting in a steady tone. Unlike other brands all Vandoren reeds possess the golden yellow color which serves as testament to a reeds age. These minor differences in cuts and quality of cane might not make a large impact on newer players sound, but it creates a noticeable difference and eases playing when a more experienced player who knows how to take advantage of these traits plays on them.
Many people may notice the difference in Vandoren reed strengths and other brands. While this does not affect new players who are not yet used to a particular strength, it might come as a surprise to more experienced players who assume the strength is the same as other brands. A good rule of thumb is that Vandoren strengths are usually ½ to a full rating higher than other brands. One problem that novice players should be made aware of is how to return the reed to the plastic cover that it arrives in. Less experienced players should be careful when sliding the tip of the reed into the plastic cover so that the reed does not get chipped or damaged.
Vandoren reeds clearly provide a superior tone and quality of sound when compared to some other brands. They will not let you down in the search for the best reeds, and can make your tone sound vastly improved. The features I have touched on all lead to the Vandoren reeds being a solid choice for both beginner players and experts, making them the perfect option for you.",positive

Enough about me. Great capo.",positive
181,Musical Instruments,WINGO GUITAR CAPO JX-09,$8.49 - $8.98,5,"In the 40+ years I've been playing I haven't ever used a capo on a guitar. I used one in a house band I played upright bass in that covered some rock songs I needed to change tuning for. I've been playing my acoustics a lot lately and really don't like retuning them (superstition maybe? Idk for sure but I prefer to tune acoustics and leave them there) thinking if I change tuning too often they'll never stay in. I use a lot of different tunings.

I have a jasmine, a Martin, and an Ibanez all full sized 21 fret except the Jasmine is a mid-sized body and has a tapered neck. It fits the martin and the ibanez everywhere but just barely. If you have a wide neck guitar like a big Les Paul it might not cover the high E well enough (?) so if you have a wide neck it might be a good idea to check measurements and be sure the one you get fits. This one might not.

I love the look of this capo I'm not sure what the wood grain on it is. It may be paint? Or some sort of laminent or sticker but it seems to be on there really well.

As I said I don't use capo's much. Now that I have one I'll be using them more. Only one of my 3 acoustics is anywhere near standard E. They're all dropped pretty low. Open C for the martin and standard D in ""drop D"" on the Ibanez. The Jasmine is a half step down.

Now that I have a capo I can finally figure standard tuning songs out I always wanted to learn and love playing. I'll update and let you know if it does at some point.

So far I used it to figure out Madona - Don't Tell Me, Lynard Skynard - Simple Man, and some classical songs I always played dropped from memory and ear to be sure I have them right.

Gotta reposition it if there's a buzz. That's how I think all capo's are. If there's a buzz it means you don't have it positioned right, you may have to move it up or down or have it on a slight angle sometimes. Buzzing doesn't mean the capo is broken. It's more likely from a fret wire not being set right or the action being too low.

If you have a buzz constantly you can't get rid of next time you change the strings put a piece of wood on the fret that's doing it, grab a hammer and give it a whack to set it better or file the fret wire down with a file or sand paper.

Guitar's are hand made, ya know? I've run my necks on almost all my electric guitars on a belt sander and sanded the fret wires almost completely flat. I like a really low, light-touch-required action and it prevents any chance of fret buzz. It doesn't effect the sound or hurt the guitar at all. The frets aren't what creates the note you're playing they're markers. Where you put your finger on the string creates the note.
Violins, Cello's and uprights are fretless. There's also fretless guitars....
Any buz noise you have is that darn wire marker. Shave'r down and get rid of the noise.",positive

200,Musical Instruments,Cable Matters Male to Female XLR Microphone Cable,$15.99 - $49.99,5,"TL;DR: These cables are extremely nice quality and are free of interference and defects for a fairly low price.

I ordered these because the last few cables I bought from CableMatters were pretty good quality and arrived very quickly. These were also the right length and price for what I was looking for, except I was going to end up with *2* cables for the price I was expecting to pay for a single cable.

They came in a padded Amazon envelope and inside a single plastic bag within this envelope; the bag also had a large label on it saying it should contain 2 cables and warning the distributor that they are to stay packaged together in a pair. I guess they've had issues with separation, kind of made me laugh a tiny bit because this warning label is so prominent.

I disassembled the connector on the female end just enough to check the assembly and material quality, since I just assembled one of these recently and I knew it would be easy to take apart and put back together. I wanted to make sure I got what CableMatters claims to sell, and I'm happy to say it looks like it's all exactly what they said it is on their site.

WIRE/CABLE:

Anyway, these cables are very thickly insulated with copper braid shielding. Supposedly there's foil in their under the copper braiding, but I couldn't see it in there and I don't want to damage anything digging for it. (Braided shielding is more effective, more expensive, and usually provides lower resistance path to ground than foil, but adding a layer of foil provides complete coverage against interference.)

Inside of the shielding, there are two conductors (separately insulated wires--hot and ground) that are very thin gauge. I'm not sure what gauge, but I'm guessing it's like 24 or 26 AWG.

The jacket of the cable (outermost layer) is soft, thick, and should be made of PVC but I don't know how to tell what the material actually is. Scratching it with my nail doesn't seem to hurt it. Text is printed at regular intervals on it in a very clear font; it contains their logo and reads, ""Cable Matters (THEIR WEBSITE URL)HIGH QUALITY MICROPHONE CABLE"" and does not otherwise describe the ratings or properties of the cable; I would have liked to know the ratings and maybe who manufactures the cable material (I don't think CM makes the wire in-house, I think they just modify and assemble it), but that's me.

CONNECTORS:

You can disassemble these connectors by gently unscrewing the black plastic strain relief cones from the metal connector housings.

The connectors seem to be some Neutrik XLR gold-plated connectors, which have been repainted in semi-gloss black, do not have the stamped NEUTRIK labels on the strain relief or housing, and have a silkscreened small CableMatters logo opposite of the latching mechanism. I'm not sure which model line (eg XX, EMC) the connectors are, and I can't be completely sure if they are actually NEUTRIK or just look the same. The springy plastic ring around the strain relief can probably be swapped for Neutrik's XXR-n (swap n for numbers 0 through 9) color coding rings. These are currently $0.25 or so each if you order them from electrical supply companies, such as Mouser or Allied, but if you really want them from an Amazon vendor, I saw a listing selling them for $6 *each* with an additional ~$7 in shipping, or another listing that sells them for about $8 shipped. :)

The paint looks like the polyester powdercoating that I've seen on Hoffman industrial enclosures at work, except thinner, so I believe it's the same stuff. It's not a very tough paint, in my experience; it will probably scuff somewhat easily if you drag or hit it against metal, but I also think that since it's thin, it probably is at least not going to have poor adhesion or just flake off, and it shouldn't get damaged by fingernails, wood, or plastic.

The wires and shielding are soldered to the connector pins and tab; the solder is shiny, I was not able to pry off any connections with my fingernail (I'd rather know if they are cold-soldered sooner rather than in the middle of a gaming session), and the insulation of the wires and connector isolator material are not deformed or melted. These cables are probably assembled by hand and the workmanship is absolutely fantastic.

SOUND QUALITY:

Using the direct monitor setting, even with my pre-amp's mic gain setting turned all the way to +60 dB, the sound through this cable is crystal-clear and no detectable hiss. I can clearly hear sparrows chirping and wind blowing through my open window with how high I have the gain set; when I swap to my old cobbled-together coax abomination cable, there is a lot of popping, there is a low hum, and everything going through my mic sounds horribly distorted. I wish I had a ""real"" XLR cable that I could compare it to.

NOTE: My pre-amp has noise filtering, so it's possible that some interference may still be getting picked up in this cable and the amp is managing to filter it all out enough that I can't detect it at full gain. The pre-amp definitely doesn't filter much noise from my other cable, though, so I think this cable from CM blocks interference extremely well.",positive

We had been putting these two mics on different PCs participating in the zoom session, but it caused issues if we didn’t be careful to only have one mic on, and neither mic with the speaker.

Using this interface, zoom sees the two mic channels as a stereo inputs, and by default mixes it down to mono, so no extra software needed. Our first meeting using this solution ran much easier, had great feedback from the virtual attendees, and allowed much better participation from the virtual participants. So this was a win.

225,Musical Instruments,"Focusrite Scarlett Solo 3rd Gen USB Audio Interface, for the Guitarist,",$119.49 - $412.74,4,"I would give the 2i2 product all 5 stars, but 4i4 has a couple of deficiencies that really affect its usability. The only reason for me to get a 4i4 (over 2i2) was having the two line inputs 3 and 4 in the back. I have guitar pedals and other instruments with standard stereo line outputs and I wanted to be able to sing or play along with a stereo instrument. So I use inputs 3/4 as stereo line input and one of the front inputs for mic or another instrument.

The front inputs and pre-amps are great, but the back inputs 3/4 sensitivity is too low, so even if I bump the output level on my guitar box all the way, the sound is still too soft compared to the other inputs and music track on the computer. Having to re-adjust my gear to use with this device and then back to use with other devices is pretty annoying - not sure why they wouldn't make the inputs 3/4 normal standard line inputs...

Another annoying thing with 4i4 is not having buttons for INST/AIR on the front panel, which 2i2 has. It means that I have to always open the Focusrite Control to make any changes. So my recommendation would be - if you do not really need inputs 3/4, which do not work well anyway, then get 2i2 - it is cheaper and much more usable.

Oh, and when I contacted support, they got back to me within a couple of days and explained that it is OK to have fixed line inputs much lower than front inputs. Although my question was different - why the fixed line inputs are not the standard line level inputs, and if there was any way to increase their level with a firmware update of other means, they would not answer these questions and suggested that I add another amp.

Update: after further research, I think that inputs 3-4 are the +4 dBu (pro audio gear) type, while I was expecting the consumer-grade -10 dbV level standard - would be nice to have a switch. I could not find this specified anywhere in the docs, nor was this explained by support. I compared this product with a competing solution Volt 476 - their inputs 3-4 are even lower sensitivity and have no controls whatsoever. So I stick with Focusrite - at least the levels 3-4 can be bumped in Focusrite Control software, making them more or less usable.

Update 2: To completely solve the problem with inputs 3-4 levels I bought a Morley Line Level Shifter
(https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NQ1SMTJ). It's a passive device that uses transformers to bump the voltage level - another $100, but now I am completely happy.",positive
226,Musical Instruments,"Focusrite Scarlett Solo 3rd Gen USB Audio Interface, for the Guitarist,",$119.49 - $412.74,4,"REVISED REVIEW:

I'm an easy customer. The thing works, I'm happy. Thing doesn't work, I'm unhappy. The Focusrite worked out of the box (YAY!). Then it has issues (BOO!). Then I resolved said issues (YAY!). Now it works as expected.

Has this device been a walk in the park? No, not really. There are some tweaks you need to make to your computer (See Update 7/7/2020 & 8/21/2020).

With that said, I have been using my Focusrite LITERALLY every day. I have a Rode NT1 attached and I use that for video conferencing, recording vocals for my band GreyHalo, for podcasts, and for playing only D&D with family and friends. It's been a huge asset in this online life, and I have to say .. I'm happy I got this.

While I originally said I would hard pass in the future, I've decided I LIKE my Focusrite 2i2. It's nor perfect, but from what I've read on other audio interfaces, nothing is. My son has a PreSonus AudioBox USB 96 2x2 USB Audio Interface and we've had to do some tweaking to his laptop to get it to work as expected. I realize that it's impossible for any company to know how everyone's computer will work with their hardware.

So would I recommend this again? Yes, yes I would. And in fact, I have. And with that, I've also told them the tweaks I've made and how to do it so they can get faster results.

I still have latency in my DAW of choice (Reaper), but that's something I'll have to resolve in the DAW. Not Focusrite's fault. But I've used some pretty hoity-toity VST/VSTi with this Focusrite 2i2 and it's handled everything like a champ. I'm not disappointed one bit in my purchase. And in the future, when I need something beefer, you can be sure I'll look to Focusrite once more.

UPDATE 8/21/202:

OK! After scouring the interwebs, I think I found out the issue with crackling in certain software (Discord, Facebook video, Steam chats). It turns out most of those software requires a higher sample rate. I had my Focusrite set at 44100, which was the default that the audio interface started at. HOWEVER, if you put it at 48000 with a buffer size of 192 then the crackling is gone and you can use any software as excepted.

UPDATE 7/7/2020:
After finally getting through to customer support (took some time) I have finally fixed the issue. It's actually a USB issue. Windows has a feature that puts USB devices to sleep, and for some reason does not see the audio interface as an active device even if it's being used. Which is weird and frustrating. Once I disabled the option it's not had any issues. The lack of star is because it took so blooming long for them to get back to me I almost abandoned all hope.

However, since I had it fixed I recorded several songs with no issues. Lord willing my music career will finally see some fruition.

Is it worth the purchase? For the price, yeah it's a decide device. I do wish I would have gotten the Presonus as it has midi in, but I think if you don't have a need for midi this is a solid device that should last a while.

ONE last issue. Latency. If I can use Guitar Rig with my guitar in real time that would be great. But I haven't figured out if that's because of my DAW (Reaper) or the device.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I'm going to start this off by saying I work in IT. I'm also not new to the recording world as I've used other products in the past. So I know my way around buffer sizes and sample.

With that said, I'm going to flat out say that this has been nothing but a pain in my neck. I bought the Scarlet 2i2 with the intention of recording voices for games and animation, as well as podcasts. Since the quarantine order, I've used it for video conferencing with work. And, it works. I have a Rode NT1 and everything sounds amazing.

HOWEVER, the driver will crash constantly. I'll be watching a video, and it will just stop working. I'll be in the middle of a conference call, and it will crash. It's crashed while recording a podcast. It's crashed while recording a video. It just .. crashes.

And the only thing I can do is force it to restart by changing the buffer size. Then it kicks back in and I'm good for a while.

It's beyond infuriating. There are no errors in the event log. All the drivers are up to date, as far as I know. Except the Focusrite website is always seems to be down. My computer is more than powerful enough to run this relatively simple device.

I really want to like this, and I really want to recommend these to my friends who also are looking for hardware for recording their own podcasts and videos and so on. In this time of isolation, people are looking for professional solutions to record good audio. This interface ... I'd do a hard pass.",positive

I have a bunch of nail files in different size and grit that I use on my actual fingernails, and they're literally a dime a dozen, but I like a nice, soft, fine grit for reeds, preferably one that's just big enough for youi to hold the reed between your finger and thumb while you GENTLY run the file over the facing of the reed. You don't want to take off a lot (Unless it's literally tree bark and you're already sure it's a dud anyway). Just a little at a time can go a long way, no special tools or training required.",positive

Natural reeds generally seem to be better for intermediate and advanced players, and I am at the low-intermediate level.

240,Musical Instruments,Vandoren SR2115 Alto Saxophone Reed,$28.95 - $83.84,5,"Whether a serious musician or a beginner, you've probably heard of Vandoren reeds. As always, it remains the standard and the best reed-maker in the business. I apologize if this review might seem basic, but I'm targeting this review to the latter audience because I feel that experienced musicians are probably already familiar with Vandorens. Additionally, while I have tackled a variety of musical styles, performed well in solo and group festivals/competitions, and played in collegiate bands, I am by no means a professional and only play as a hobby now. This rating is based on my personal experience and the collective opinion of people whom I have played with and who use Vandorens. To be fair, I have given these reeds 5 STARS IN COMPARISON TO ALL OTHER REEDS ON THE MARKET THAT I HAVE USED, not based exclusively on the product individually. I have tried a wide variety of reeds including, Vandoren original (this product), Vandoren V16, Rico, Rico Royal, Legere synthetic (plastic), etc. Also, remember that in order to get the best out of your reeds, you should be using a good mouthpiece and ligature. From the very beginning I have been using a C-star s-80 mouthpiece and rovner ligature. In terms of instruments, I started off with a Selmer Bundy II but for the past 8 years I have been played on yamahas (marching band) and a silver-plated Selmer series iii alto saxophone for personal/symphonic/concert use (the instrument was WAY cheaper than current Selmer models when it was purchased in 2003). Knowing what I know now, if you are considering purchasing a higher-end saxophone, I would highly recommend a laquered instrument; the silver plating has been sssooooo annoying/time-consuming to upkeep and both produce the same quality of sound. Also, if you do find a series ii and a series iii (although I don't know if either are in production anymore), go with a series ii super action 80. I wish I had; there are some pitch issues on the iii. But if you are still in the market for an instrument, talk with professionals in the area; I am no longer familiar with which instruments are the best on the market for beginners, upper level, etc.

Cons: If I was not comparing these reeds to other manufacturers, I would give this product 4 stars because I feel the quality of Vandoren reeds has slightly decreased over the years. I mean this by saying that while there used to be only a few ""duds"" per box, the percentage has increased (I know of multiple professional musicians who share my opinion in this regard) over the 12-ish years I have been using them (I've been playing for 13, but started out on Rico Royals--I will never go back to those again). Now, I find that only a few reeds per box of 10 are of the exceptional quality that I am looking for. For the beginners, by ""duds"", I mean reeds that won't consistently give you high quality tone and control over an extended period of time. With these, I find that it takes me an especially long time to break them in (keep in mind all reeds to take some time to break in, no matter how good the quality). And if they ever do reach the clean tone I am looking for, it is rare, and very short-lived (a week or so max with a couple hours of play-time every day). With these ""duds"", you will see a higher incidence of ""squeaks"" and a larger difficulty controlling your dynamics (volume), especially at extremes such as pianissimo, fortissimo, etc (very quiet, very loud) or particularly low/high notes, especially above upper D (above the staff) and below lower D (below the staff). The poorer quality the reed, additionally the more difficulty you will have controlling your tone; you may find that your tone is too brassy or that it is difficult to change your tone to suit different styles of music, even with changing your embouchure (mouth positioning) and/or air flow.

Now onto the pros: Even with their setbacks, Vandoren remains the best reed manufacturer. When you do find those good reeds, you will find unmatched quality and amazing flexibility in your capabilities and won't have to work as hard to achieve your desired results. Additionally (in my experience), when you first start playing and don't have strong control over your embouchure and tone, you really won't notice a difference in quality from reed to reed, especially at lower strengths like 2, 2.5. The quality difference I mentioned is something that you likely won't realize or annoy you until you start playing at an upper level and have strengthened your air tone and air control (for me, it took about 4-5 years with private lessons once a week and band practice for an hour 5x/week; keep in mind I started using Vandorens and taking lessons in 6th grade--if you are starting as an adult and/or have already mastered another wind instrument, this likely will greatly reduce that time). And even once you reach an upper level, most of the ""duds"" can still be used for everyday practice, just not concert performance. In fact, I find that forcing myself to play on these reeds has helped me develop the control I had over my tone, instead of relying solely on the quality of the reed. SOMETHING NEW I LOVE: All of the reeds are now individually sealed air-tight like little candies. In the past, all of the reeds used to only be in their own plastic holders but still loose so if for some reason there was excess moisture in your case (e.g. you forgot to leave your case open to let a wet instrument dry out from playing in marching band) over only one night you could end up with an entire box of ruined moldy reeds (this has happened to me on more than one occasion). Now, I am never faced with that issue. That being said, if your instrument/case is at all damp/wet, it is crucial to let things dry out or it could do some serious damage to your instrument over time (accelerated rusting, stiff/cracked leather on the pads, loosened pads from deteriorated glue, etc.)

Choosing the strength of your reeds: When I was first chair my senior year of high school, I was playing on 3's and switched to 3.5s when I started playing in a collegiate marching band (if you need to frequently play extremely loud like I had to for marching, then you will need stronger reeds; you'll have less tone control on softer reeds at louder volumes and burn through them more quickly). But after needing such a strong embouchure for so long, I had to stick with 3.5s to maintain the tone quality I desired, even in a symphonic concert setting. If I go for months without playing, I have to start off using 3s until my embouchure is strong enough again. Some of my peers were playing on 4.0s. When I was a freshman the first chair was a 4.5. Remember that being able to play on stronger reeds does not equate to greater ability--it is reflected by the natural strength of your embouchure and air flow. Working your way up in strength takes time and should not be rushed; at one point you might reach a strength and never increase again. As a casual player, I hover around a 3.0-3.5. As long as you are getting a good smooth tone out of your reeds, stay at that strength. If you are a beginner, I would recommend starting out on a 2.0 or 2.5 for these Vandoren reeds. If you are younger, completely new to wind playing/have a weak embouchure, have undeveloped diaphragm muscles (i.e. you can't push air very strongly), or any combination of the above, start out with a weaker strength. For adults I would probably recommend a 2.5, for children I would recommend a 2.0, but that is by no means the rule. It is better to start off with a weaker strength than a stronger one. If you receive your reeds and are able to put out a sound immediately, easily (without pushing air very hard), and your tone sounds more like a buzz, then the reed strength is too low and you should move up (e.g. move from 2.0 to 2.5). If you really struggle to put out a sound and can only manage to squawk or play loudly but not quietly, try to play on the reed for a few days if you can get out a sound. But if you are still facing the same issues, you should consider moving down a strength.
***I have been referring only to the original Vandoren reeds in terms of strength. I would strongly advise you to use Vandoren over any other manufacturer. But if they are just too expensive, consider Rico Royal (NOT RICO). If that is the case, then add 0.5 to everything (e.g. a Vandoren 2.5=Rico Royal 3.0). Also, the Vandoren reeds are optimal for classical playing but can also be used for a broad range of styles--I've used them for marching band, symphony band, jazz band, etc. But if you positively know that you will only be playing jazz music, consider using the Vandoren V16s and purchasing a jazz mouthpiece and ligature.

248,Musical Instruments,Vandoren SR2115 Alto Saxophone Reed,$28.95 - $83.84,5,"These were good for some classical symphony rep I played on closed tip mouthpieces. As usual for Vandoren, these were very polished, consistent reeds. They give a bit more support and focus for classical playing in general.

All reeds are made of cane, known as Arundo Donax. It is not wood or bamboo, but more closely related to tall grasses. It grows around river banks and lakes with moving water. It absorbs the water for growth and nutrients. It MUST be properly collected when the stalk is drained of water in the winter (dry season) and it must be drained and dried to avoid including biological and chemical impurities. The climate also affects its density, which limits where good reed stock can grow. Cane will absorb whatever is in the water where it grows.

Good reeds should have a smooth vamp (shaped upper part) and have a golden- yellow or light yellow color without much variation. The bark can be of varied tone (glossy-looking bottom part). That's OK. It should not have fibrous longitudinal protrusions on the vamp (part that goes inside the mouth). Green looking reeds have not been properly dried and drained. Throw them away. Grey looking reeds or ones with dark spots or streaks may have mold. Throw them away also. (This is highly unlikely in Vandoren or Daddario reeds).

Good reeds are expensive. However, with proper care, you CAN make them last months.. or longer. Just teach your kids proper care skills. It's a wonderful way to teach being responsible.

Always take the reed off after playing. Always put them back into the holder (or get a special case). NEVER touch the tip of the reed (I see kids do it all the time.. and they break the reeds). Practice securing the reed to the mouthpiece with the ligature without tripping the tip. Carefully wash the reeds with water once a week, wiping with clean fingers, bottom to top. And lastly, don't play one reed all the time. Have a few ready to go and rotate them. If you do this, or teach your kids, a box of quality reeds will last you a very long time... and you won't have to buy cheap non-reeds made in china..",positive

255,Musical Instruments,ChromaCast Pro Series Folding Music Stand,$12.48 - $38.99,4,"I ordered the ChromaCast Pro Series Music Stand w/ Accessories. The first shipment arrived within 2 weeks, and was noticeably damaged due to a lack of proper shipment packing including the use of a flimsy thin cardboard box. This resulted in damage to the rather thin metal of the music stand's ""desk"" and the attachment plate on the tripod. The order was also missing the listed travel bag to carry the music stand in. I contacted Amazon immediately to describe the damage and the missing item, and I requested a replacement shipment. They immediately provided me with a free return shipping label for the defective order and they initiated a replacement shipment. I simply had to repack and seal the items in the same flimsy box, attach the provided shipping label and take it to a UPS Store.

The second shipment arrived 1 week later (free of charge) and was well packed in a sturdy box and bubble wrap. There was no damage and it included the items as listed for the Pro Series order (including the travel bag - hurrah!). Sadly the 2 headed LED Stand Light has an electric short in 1 head. However, I'm quite satisfied with the rest of the order and ChromaCast's efforts to improve their quality control of the replacement order.

Generally the stand is well made and is light weight - though the metal for the ""desk"" portion is a bit thin and the ""desk"" shelf is only 1.75 inches deep. (The shelf depth of a typical wire stand is 1.6 inches, and a Manhassat stand is 2.25 inches.) I'm not sure that it will be able to handle the weight of a folder full of sheet music AND a good quality stand light. However, it should hold up to general light use for my rehearsal and concert needs and I think it will be much better than using a wire stand.",positive

Depending on where you mount it, you can have full 360 degrees if you manage your cable correctly.

Materials are sturdy enough to hold tightly in place, but give a hint that if you push it too far, it will bend or break at the pivot points. Just take care of it and pay attention and you won’t have any worries.

Comes with the adapters you need, so don’t worry these. Also comes with cable ties, which are very good quality.

Cons- Previously mentioned possibilities of damaging the metal if you’re not paying attention.

Conducts noise to the microphone easily if mounted on the same desk or table you’re using. Little bumps travel the hollow arm pieces and smack the mic real hard. Mount somewhere that you’re not smacking your hands or other items on.

Solid purchase.",positive

Honestly, It does everything my buddie's microphone arm does at 1/5th the price. Its not rated to hold as heavy and bulky a microphone as his is, and I haven't attempted to test as we both don't have a massive microphone to test out on it.

I was able to easily setup my snowball (I just had to screw on the female metal lug-nut to the male end and then I was able to screw on my snowball for a snug fit) and clamp it to my desk.

My only downside is that moving the mic around requires a little more effort then higher-end call mic stands; but that's completely understandable for the price. But if you want something that moves seamlessly you may want to invest in a higher-priced movable mic ( like the ones you'll see on high-end podcasts). And if you are a musician who is not using their microphone for gaming, streaming, YouTube or podcasting you may want to invest in a higher-end movable mic stand as you will most likely have higher and microphones. If you have a $1,000 microphone a $15 mic stand might not be ideal. But even with those small critiques it has all of the components to set up most microphones. Now all that matters is if it will continue to have durability and I will make sure to update this review if there are any faults or issues with it.",positive

280,Musical Instruments,"Snark SN5X Clip-On Tuner for Guitar, Bass & Violin (Current Model)",$14.99,4,"This is a super handy gadget and I have several in my studio so I can just have them ready to go on whatever instruments I'm cycling through for a project. It's really handy that I don't have to plug anything in or mess about with pedals. Just make sure to have some extra batteries on hand. These take CR-2032 batteries (the ones that look like coins) and the tuner doesn't give much indication that the battery is starting to go. Once the display starts dimming, it's a pretty rapid decline from there.

The only caveat is that, while they're good for spot checking, the resolution on the tuner isn't high enough to get tuning dead on. I've noticed that this clip on tuner will show a guitar is in tune, but sometimes when I check it on my boss TU-3 chromatic tuner, the notes will be just slightly sharp or flat. It's usually pretty good, but it has happened on occasion that the tuner will tell me everything is good to go, but the guitar will be slightly out of tune.
That said, you should always check tuning by ear after using a tuner anyway. I'll use them to double check tuning before recording (and they'd be great for on stage) but if I'm setting the intonation of the bridge or just starting work for the day, I'll use a higher resolution tuner.
In this case, it's a convenient gadget and I'll probably buy a few more to have clipped to various instruments.",positive

283,Musical Instruments,"Snark SN5X Clip-On Tuner for Guitar, Bass & Violin (Current Model)",$14.99,5,"I loved my old Snark tuner, but it was covered in a grippy rubberized coating that in hot, humid Taiwan became sticky after several years. I had to replace it a couple years ago, and got a smooth plastic one that didn't have the same problem. Excellent tuner, easy to clip onto my guitar's head; the Snark head swivels conveniently, it's easy to use, accurate, and runs forever on just one battery. Neither tuner ever stopped functioning (the first lasted at least 11 years, with only one battery change, and was still functioning at around 12 years when I tossed it due to the stickiness). CON: the upper rubber foot OFTEN fell off the 2nd one (contact cement failed to solve it, but cyanoacrylate (SuperGlue) seems to be working now, having held for six weeks so far.) The rubber foot (part of the lining of the clip so it doesn't damage the guitar's finish) was heat and humidity resistant, and never turned sticky on either of them despite the very high humidity and heat here. I've just bought a 3rd for my sons and will report back on whether the rubber foot now stays on better, after using it for a while. LOVE these Snarks!!!",positive

287,Musical Instruments,"Snark SN5X Clip-On Tuner for Guitar, Bass & Violin (Current Model)",$14.99,3,"The blurb on this tuner says it is calibrated to work with bass, but it does this poorly, and my guess is that the very high rating this gets is mostly from guitar players. Particularly if you're doing five or six strings, and need to tune the B, this is going to read wrong at the least half the time. While I was on B, it read it as a D or even a C, at least half the time. I have to stop the string, and try again, and then it reads correctly- about half the time. No change to the tuning, just a bad read on the part of the device.

I'm well aware that it takes a little longer to get the bass note across, since it is a lower frequency, but several seconds is enough to read even the lowest many times, and it still gets it wrong. But when you change from one note to another while tuning, again about half the time it just stays on the original note, getting sharper and sharper, or flatter and flatter, and you have to again stop the sound, and pluck again, and hope this time it reads the right note.

Even at this price, there are many other options. If you're a bass player, at this point I would suggest a tuner actually designed for that instrument. Not one that just claims to be.",fair

So I stopped using it for awhile. I started using it again after that certain amount of time. Maybe a month, it wasn’t plugged in or anything. It was not being used. I started to use it, and the audio from it sounded like a buzzing around so I did some troubleshoots(unplugging it, moving it away from devices, increasing the sensitivity on microphone, using a different USB port, and moving it closer to my mouth, anda software that was built into my computer to help to make microphones sound better) and nothing worked.

I cannot say the quality is any better than the built-in mic on my mac. This mic is much quieter than my compter's mic though. I've been turning the sound up 400% in iMovie (even when adjusting the settings in System Preferences)

370,Musical Instruments,Dunlop Tortex Standard Guitar Picks,$4.99 - $37.50,5,"For me, Tortex picks just feel so smooth crossing the string or strings and they produce a warm, but not overly warm sound, to my ears' discerning anyway. They feel really nice on my fingers too. I use these orange .60mm Tortex picks in a weekly church service band where I at times have to switch back and forth between acoustic, lap steel, electric rhythm, and lead electric parts complete with the church triads and solo lines. I don't want to change picks then, changing instruments can be cumbersome enough, and I find these .60mm gauges to be the ideal compromise, that's just me though. Season to taste. They're just flexible enough to have that little bit of give I like on strummed acoustic parts without being so thin I break them. I do play too hard I'm afraid, a quick and light attack on the strings is so much better for one's tone and sustain, but I get excited, what can I say? Then for the triads and solo lines to cut through, I move down the teardrop with my index finger to stiffen things up and then I kind of get the best of both worlds.

Also, I like these being orange because they're easy to find if I drop one and I have a tendency to leave them lying about on the stage anxious to get out and talk to folks after the service. So everybody knows my picks are orange and when they see I've left some on my monitor box or something, they always fetch 'em my way. And for some strange reason, I generally don't loose these at home like I do other picks either.

Now, I also do recording sessions on various wind and stringed instruments, and when it's guitar, my go to picks are the green .88mm Dunlop Tortex, if I use a pick at all. I do temper my inner animal to the extent needed in those sessions and pick the strings fast and easy for optimum tone. The greenies are just great, but I best not leave any behind because these are in my experience, the most often used picks by session players and studio guitarists, so people that find them are going to think that they are theirs and hey, my bad. I use the greenies recording and playing out electric with my band too. But I still prefer the .60mm Tortex picks for acoustic parts.

I do take a Sucrets box with me to every guitar session filled with all kinds of brands, gauges, and sizes of picks, including my go to thumb and banjo finger picks. It's amazing, in my ears anyway, how much you can change the sound and/or rhythmic feel of your guitar track simply by switching picks. I've also found that you can often get a disengaged recording engineer or producer a lot more engaged in what you're doing and otherwise patient with you exploring what you can do for the track, by offering to try it with a couple of different picks. You'll get better communication when you do and when doing non-written and improvised parts, that very much helps you deliver what they're looking for.

You should know too, just in case you haven't deduced it, these picks are not made out of tortoise shells. They are just smooth and easy to grip, like a tortoise shell, while still intact on the tortoise. These are made of Delvin, which is a plastic polymer. There are guys that actually go out to beaches and riverbeds to find abandoned tortoise shells and fashion them into picks. And I have no idea how those are, but I'd surely give one a whirl if somebody fashioned it for me. But Dunlop Tortex picks are plastic. And I've found Delvin to be not only smooth and grippy, but tough. The picks don't loose the sharpness of their edge over time like many other picks do, which can actually be desirable for some guys.

So hey, give these picks a test ride. It's best to maybe go to a music store and get one of each gauge that they've got, just to see what you like before you order in bulk like I did here. But you might not be able to find the .60mm gauge. And that's another nice thing about the Tortex picks, if you like the .73 mm one you found but it feels just a little stiff, you know to go and order a dozen or so of the .60mm ones, and you'll be in business for a good while.

Happy explorations. Hope this helps.",positive

These picks are thick enough to play quick passages with defined picking but have enough give for a good strum sound. I also find them pretty comfortable (and the orange is nice for the search at the end of the night if one ends up on the floor).

410,Musical Instruments,"D’Addario NYXL0838 Nickel Plated Electric Guitar Strings,Extra Super Ligh",$11.49 - $233.99,5,"TL;DR: These things are some sort of magic steel forged from Dwarven Mithril. The hype is real, D'addario are string wizards.

Like a lot of guitarists, I never really cared that much about strings. Sure I've had packs that I liked more than others, sure I have a gauge that I prefer, but I was never overly picky and never saw the point in buying expensive strings. In fact, I had a bad experience with some premium Elixers years and years ago that probably wasn't indicative of how good Elixer strings actually are, but it pretty much put me off of ever buying strings priced over $5.

After recently having multiple strings break while restringing with more affordable strings, I decided to finally give NYXL strings a try. I've always heard that they are really good but never gave in to the hype.

It's kind of hard to accurately describe these strings. They are phenomenal really. They have a feel that no other string I've tried has. There's like a slightly tighter tension there, but the resistance is still at the level I want for bending. I like 10s because I want easier bends, but still have more push back and resistance than a set of 9s (which feel like spaghetti noodles to me). These things feel almost like the tension of 11s (which I used to use for many years until I realized they were killing my fingers) but are so easy to play. They almost have like a very slightly waxy feel, which honestly feels amazing under your fingers. It probably sounds silly but they honestly do have a premium feel to them. I had zero issues stringing these up, and didn't need to pre-stretch them near as much as other strings I've used. They also just straight up stay in tune. I've only had to retune my LP slightly, and my Tele is rock solid. I can imagine these working really well for trems.

I normally can't tell the difference between how strings sound. Since I've switched from 11s to 10s I can't tell a difference from either gauge besides feel. But these strings are obviously louder with a punchier mid range. Personally I'm not a huge fan of how bright and shrill a brand new set of strings can be, but these don't have that issue. The bright treble is definitely there, but the mid range is so much more pronounced, which is what I like personally. I never thought I'd prefer the sound of one set of strings to another, but these really do make my guitars sound the way I feel they were meant to sound. They really fill out to sound of my Tele as well which was a pleasant surprise.

I've been playing these for hours on end on both my Tele and LP for almost a week now while playing at home and rehearsal in my band. I can't see any real signs of wear. Normally around this time I've worn in a new set of strings pretty thoroughly but this are still pretty close to looking new. More importantly they still sound just as bright as a fresh pack.

The fact that D'addario offers a points reward system as well is pretty awesome. Seems like for every 8 packs I can get a free pack of these, which is more than I can say for any other brand.

Long story short, the hype is real. Yes these are at a premium price, but with how long they last, how great they sound, how long they sound great, and how great they feel, it's really a no brainer. These strings truly are amazing. I won't string any of my electric guitars with anything else now that I've tried these.",positive
411,Musical Instruments,"D’Addario NYXL0838 Nickel Plated Electric Guitar Strings,Extra Super Ligh",$11.49 - $233.99,4,"These maintain their tone and stability pretty well for how I treat them , I'm pretty rough on my electric guitar as I'm mainly a bass player and don't have the proper facilities to store it as well as I should , but these have yet to let me down after so many purchases! I don't play electric as often as I'd like to but every time I come back , it's in tune (mostly, the G string never is but that's a problem with stratocasters) and it's still bright ! The strings do get a little grody but that's not something a little bit of maintenance can't fix. These are great if you're looking to get strings that you can put on and forget about !

Ok, so they cost a few bucks more than your average set but let me tell you; they are worth every penny!!! Tuning and setting intonation is so painless with these strings and once you have tried then you will never again question how much difference a good set of strings can make. I can’t recommend these strings highly enough! Try them. You’ll love them!!!!

The balanced tension really helps make three octave shred runs feel more seamless. Shredding in general on the lower strings feels easier. I hope they always make these.,positive

I was really confused but put them back on anyway since i was going to return them but just wanted to see how they sounded first. But i was AMAZED on how they sounded. It sounded clean and amazing on my AMP and really liked the sound of it. Even though one string was missing, i really enjoyed them for a while!",positive
416,Musical Instruments,"D’Addario NYXL0838 Nickel Plated Electric Guitar Strings,Extra Super Ligh",$11.49 - $233.99,5,"These strings literally redefined my sound, not joking. Ultimately before my humbuckered guitars they made a huge difference in the sound, even with single coils. Then humbuckers was even better. I do recommend you buy this product in the 25 bulk pack, even if you aren't a shop, because you will run out of strings QUICKLY if your a true player and have multiple guitars. My only complaint for this product is strings sometimes get caught in the tube in the box leading to them getting stuck and not coming out or going back in, at that point i have to cut the top of the string off to close it, but that's just a string here or there. These last me about 3 weeks of playing CONSTANTLY, like 3 hours a day. If your someone who practices occasionally and for a short period of time, these will last you much longer than me, but ultimately they are really good. They don't break often, bend much easier than any other 11 gauge, and I just love em'!",positive

442,Musical Instruments,Ernie Ball Polypro Guitar Strap,$4.00 - $22.99,3,"These are a far cry from the same straps of yesterday.

The nylon strap material is cheap feeling and just flimsy. These are not particularly comfortable straps. I mainly use these on my instruments while recording at my desk in a seated position, to prevent accidental drops. I would not trust these on stage for any type of dynamic performances. Not to mention a guitar of any substance will cause this strap to dig into your shoulder. You don't need that.

If you're sitting on a chair, In a coffee house, and just need some drop protection - they are ok, and cheap. Anything more, and this strap will be a huge disappointment.

The leather ends are really cheap cuts of scrap, too. They used to be so substantial, you would have a hard time getting them onto your strap button when they were new.
They are much easier to put on your strap buttons now, because the leather is so thin and cheap. The opening will stretch quickly on these cheapos, so you may need strap locks of some sort. Consider that and add the extra cost to your investment. Also keep in mind that using this on a nitro finish or even lighter color finish guitars is probably not advisable as I would imagine the cheap leather will allow the dye to rub off over time. No one needs that, little surprise.

Anyway, for what I use them for, when they were on sale for six bucks, that's a reasonable deal. Otherwise, especially if you are a beginner, do not assume, cheap is good, because you are just starting out. It's not, and will only dampen your enjoyment of playing. Get something better, and be happy.",fair

The cable color options are black/gray (the one I bought) and brown/gold. There’s a lot of cable choices out there but I’m glad I bought this one.",positive
461,Musical Instruments,GLS Audio Guitar Cable - Amp Cord for Bass & Electric Guitar - Straight to Right Angle,$8.59 - $19.99,5,"I've had this cable for a couple of years, I think. It's been my main cable pretty much since I bought it. Now I'm into a bit of a rabbit hole with cables. I've been trying out a few other cables, and it's starting to dawn on me why I keep coming back to this cable.

Getting particulars out of the way: This is a reasonably high quality cable for not a lot of money. It's well constructed, with good quality materials. It doesn't make unwanted signal noise when I move it around on the floor. And the metal sleeves are nice and tight, so I don't have to struggle keeping them fastened, like I do with some of my other cables.

In this rabbit hole about cables, my ears are getting a little more attuned to variables in my signal chain. I'm starting to understand how important a good cable can be. Just yesterday I was using one of the new cables, and I was very unhappy with my sound. I wasn't hearing what I wanted to hear. I heard too much bottom end, and not enough sparkle in the top end. It was so frustrating that I stopped playing, and I almost gave up for the day. My ears can hear when something's wrong. I may not be able to articulate it exactly, but I'm getting better at spotting differences.

Thankfully, I didn't give up. I decided to put away the new cable and use this one instead, my main cable. As I expected, it sounded suddenly right. The sound I was chasing was in focus again, and the day was saved. This cable has become a part of that sound.

And truly, this isn't the first time I've realized it--it's just becoming more obvious now. I've used other cables with other guitars, and they don't sound the same after this one.

I know that part of the truth of this is that for two years, I've been dialing sounds with this cable, so my signal chain has become tuned to this cable. So I'm not saying this is a magical cable or anything, but I do know when it sounds right, and I know I get the sounds I'm trying to get when I'm plugged in with this cable. That's enough to convince me it's good.

Yesterday's issue was a eureka moment for me, and all was right in my small world again. Now I know that the right cable can be a significant contributing factor to a good guitar tone.

I may have to get another.",positive
