0,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clogs (Best Sellers),$20.17 - $104.99,5,"These are my first pair of Crocs and it was love at first try-on! I bought the basic Classic ones which I read are supposed to fit pretty loosly. The toe box is perfect for my wide feet and allows my toes to spread. There is just the right amount of space in front of my toes. The instep is maybe tighter than I read it is supposed to fit. I have a high instep and what is called a full foot. The shoe is not tight but there is contact with my foot all across the area between the holes on top and the foot opening. It's not uncomfortable or tight at all but I read the fit is supposed to be such that your foot does not touch the shoe here. I also wonder if they would cause blisters. From what I read there is supposed to be space here between your foot and the shoe. If I wore socks they would need to be thin ones.

Second thing is when I received them I tipped them out of the bag onto my hard floor. (I am still cautious about packaging due to Covid concerns so this is just the way I do things.) I noticed the next day that the spot where they landed on the floor is now really slick. From some kind of powder? Can anyone tell me what is used to dust new shoes with? i am not concerned about toxicity or anything like that i am just curious because it is so darned slick! I contacted Crocs but the representative told me he did not know the answer.",positive

However, I have high blood pressure and feet sometimes sweat a lot; so I needed something that breathed well. Normal shoes don't. I first tried generic brands of the rubber clogs and I don't hate those brands, they are ok and decent deal. However, these have a better toe fit, sole, and arch support; those things are a lot. I use my other generics as house slippers and reserve true crocs for town or light work. Great for feet health; but could still use slip resistant soles and better arch support. Still a 5 star item; get two pairs and switch them out each day and feet will be so much healthier. Its more like going without shoes and feet like that.",positive
2,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clogs (Best Sellers),$20.17 - $104.99,5,"These shoes run large. I wear an 8 and half but I bought these in a 7, and they fit great. I cheated a little and went to a shoe store and tried them on. When I found the size I needed, I ordered them from Amazon and saved 20 dollars. I got blue but I am thinking about ordering more in different colors. Love these shoes and an added benfit is stability. I am prone to falling and for some reason these shoes keep me stable. This may not help some people but it helps me.",positive
3,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clogs (Best Sellers),$20.17 - $104.99,5,"I was a self-professed Crocs hater. I thought they were some of the ugliest shoes on the planet. Up there with Birkenstocks. But sometimes some of the ugliest things can then turn into the cutest things, sort of like an ugly doll. I also love the ability to bling them out (the set seen in the photo: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3F9SMX1). They are of course extremely comfortable. I don't wear them just in the house either - I wear them to work, to casual functions, to dinner, lunch, etc.... The fit is true to size. I got them in the basic black and I also went ahead and bought the black with fur lining too. Highly recommend to give them a shot.",positive
4,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clogs (Best Sellers),$20.17 - $104.99,5,"I don’t know about y’all, but I’m not the biggest fan of flip-flops/slippers cause I don’t like wearing things that I feel will fall off. So, I bought some these crocs (I’m 7 1/2 in women’s; bought size 7 women’s for these) and they are PERFECT. Very comfortable, and I can run around in the house without them falling off thanks to the band.

Even if the design -in terms of aesthetics- isn’t something you like, it’s definitely a good buy because of how comfortable it is (which is why they’re my house shoes now).",positive
5,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clogs (Best Sellers),$20.17 - $104.99,5,"I've said for years that I would never wear these. I think they look terrible. But, sigh, my current pair of house shoes are dying after years of faithful service. I bought a set of these on a whim. I've worn them for about 25 hours now and I have to say they are great. The spiny ridges on the inside felt weird at first, but they disappeared from my notice in 10-15 minutes. The toe box is pleasantly roomy and they stay on my feet exceptionally well - I started with the strap on my heel but folded it forward an hour later and haven't looked back. They really are beyond comfortable and don't make my feel either too warm or too cold.

I like them enough that I've already purchased a second pair. If you've considered these, I highly recommend you give them a shot.",positive
6,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clogs (Best Sellers),$20.17 - $104.99,5,"Scenario: The $180 hiking boots that you bought (and in all honesty failed to break in) gave you a nice big blister on the hike in the day before. Now, faced with a 7+ mile hike back out the next morning, you begrudgingly slip your feet back into said boots, telling yourself “it’s only 7 miles, I’ll live.” Then, 1.5 miles in you just can’t take it anymore. What do you do? Well, you could try to apply some more Leukotape and/or moleskin and pray that that works, knowing full well it won’t. OR you could entertain busting out the trusty camp footwear that you brought along…your always stylish Crocs.

Now I know what you fellow hikers are thinking: “get outta here, there’s no way you can hike in Crocs!”

Well, I’m here to to you - Yes. You you can. And, while they certainly don’t offer the same level of support, grip, or sex appeal, they can certainly help in avoiding causing further pain in a situation like I found myself in.

So, if you’re a hiker/backpacker searching for the right camp shoe, forgo those flimsy flip flops and grab yourself a pair of these bad boys!

Oh, also, they fit and work just like any other Croc would be expected to.",positive
7,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clogs (Best Sellers),$20.17 - $104.99,5,"ive recently bought 3 pairs of crocs, red, white, and black. they are produced in three different countries. Red in mexico, black in vietnam, and white in china. i dont know if all white crocs are made in china, but what from what ive gathered, crocs made in china always fit small. all my crocs are sz 12 men, but my white pair which is the china pair fit like a 10 or 11 and narrow. again i dont know if all white crocs are made in china but if they are size up, especially if you have wider feet. im going to return these and size up, hopefully the white are all made in china so i dont get boats in the mail lol.",positive
8,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clogs (Best Sellers),$20.17 - $104.99,5,"My husband is usually a 14 1/2 or 15 wide in shoe, so you can imagine the difficulty we have in finding him shoes. I really wanted to get something easy to slip on for around the house or when we are camping and I decided to take my chances with these. They fit him perfectly. His wide (and flat) feet fit in them nicely, he said they're very comfortable and aren't too heavy but are slippery on the inside when his feet sweat. Otherwise loves them!",positive
9,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clogs (Best Sellers),$20.17 - $104.99,5,"I was always hesitant to try Crocs, mainly bc I felt they were overpriced. I got these on sale for $28 and I love them! They are super comfy and fit well. They are also very light feeling. When I first wore them and lifted my feet, it was awesome that they were so light. I am a size 8.5 and got a 9, which fit fine, but also feel like the 8 may have been better for a tighter fit. The 9s are slightly loose.",positive
10,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Under Armour Men's Tech 2.0 Short-Sleeve T-Shirt,$12.50 - $101.44,5,"Just purchased 2 of these UA Tech 2.0 shirts in XL. They are a both a smooth, light weight polyester material but it seems different colors are made in different locations so there are some variances. One was made in El Salvador (dark grey) and feels just a bit heavier and fits more loosely than the other, which was made in Jordan (dark blue/white speckled look), and is a bit tighter but has a smoother feel to the material. That said, happy with both. Both fit more loosely than a compression style shirt but tighter than a standard T shirt and both come well below my waist and sit at the hips.",positive
11,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Under Armour Men's Tech 2.0 Short-Sleeve T-Shirt,$12.50 - $101.44,5,"UA kind of sets the standard in this type of shirt, I have some Nike, Adidas, Champion, and others, but this is the one I keep coming back to. Available in all sorts of colors, reasonably priced, holds up. The sleeve and drape over the shoulder area seems to be better than most of its competition. Handles sweat and stays cold quite well.",positive
12,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Under Armour Men's Tech 2.0 Short-Sleeve T-Shirt,$12.50 - $101.44,5,"Bought 2 at Dick's then had to order another color here on Amazon. With the SPF and breathability, these shirts are perfect for summers in Miami. I ordered the Rise/Black (782) and the shirt is actually Orange (with hints of Yellow). For some reason the color on the model for this looks black - but I included a photo so you could see it's Orange (which is what I wanted). I'm very happy that Amazon has so many colors to chose from - am going to order another color now - my new #1 overall workout shirt!",positive
13,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Under Armour Men's Tech 2.0 Short-Sleeve T-Shirt,$12.50 - $101.44,5,"My wife was searching for lightweight short sleeve shirts for me online and found this one. It's lightweight, and she washes it by hand in the sink, hangs it up to to drip dry in the shower then hangs it up over a hook on the bedroom door. She has a table fan so she turns it on high setting and points it close to the shirt. It not only drys quickly, but adds needed moisture in the air in our apartment. This shirt requires no ironing. We're both in our senior years and can't physically do as much as we used to so ironing is a chore. I've worn this shirt many times and love this shirt. Feels good against my skin! Highly recommend it!",positive
14,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Under Armour Men's Tech 2.0 Short-Sleeve T-Shirt,$12.50 - $101.44,4,"Pros: This product is on of the best fitting shirts for the chest area. The shirt shows off the arms really well.

Cons: the fabric is thin. Seems like a shirt that you would only wear it to the gym and not on a hike to prevent it from getting caught on something causing it to rip. The shirt just barely goes over the belt line. Lifting arms may cause stomach to show.",positive
15,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Under Armour Men's Tech 2.0 Short-Sleeve T-Shirt,$12.50 - $101.44,5,"Light and moisture wicking. Athletic fit, but allows some room in abdomen for those lacking a six pack. I have not had any chafing problems even on long runs (10-13 miles).",positive

Opening them up I thought I'd be disappointed. I was way wrong. I ordered a 3X Tall. I like the tall sizes for the extra length. It's almost like it's cooler to wear these than it is to wear nothing. Air blows right through these shirts and really help to cool you down. I ordered 2, and ordered 2 more minutes later! They're really hard to describe. Heavier fabric, but very lightweight. I'll be wearing these in a rotation all summer.",positive

20,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",ReoRia Women's Sexy Sleeveless Racer Back Halter Neck Bodysuit Tank Tops,$19.99 - $25.99,4,"This is a quality product with good stretch and a flattering cut. The bottom of the suit is “cheeky” not a thong or full coverage. For reference I am 5’2” and 200 lbs. My chest size is a 40DD.

I bought this bodysuit to wear with a skirt I bought and overall I really like it. It has good coverage, good stretch and support and it is comfortable. The cons for me include…too much side boob exposure and overall just a bit big so I don’t feel supported enough. I bought a 2X based on the size chart but I believe the XL would have been a better fit for me. I have a short torso but a wide mid-section, I think my waist measures around 48inches. I am not sure the length from shoulders to crotch, but the crotch of the bodysuit was hanging, not snug against my body. The other con of the bodysuit is the “lining” only goes half way down and is not secure so the fabric tends to get bunched up. I will be returning the product because of the fit. I am considering buying a smaller side but I may opt for a different style that has better side coverage since my boobs are so large. If I re-purchase I will give an updated review.

***UPDATE***

I repurchased this in an XL and it fits great! Very supportive, flattering, good stretch, comfortable, no side boob exposure, no issues with the lining “bunching” up. I am sorry I do not have pics to share at this time but I will add later. I’m getting ready to purchase another one as soon as I finish this update.",positive
21,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",ReoRia Women's Sexy Sleeveless Racer Back Halter Neck Bodysuit Tank Tops,$19.99 - $25.99,5,"First, I have to start off by saying I never write reviews, simply because I am too lazy lolll. But this, this top needs one! This top is so comfortable and it fits amazing! I saw the other reviews about how you don’t need to wear a bra, and I was a little skeptical because my boobs don’t sit up nicely by themselves. To my surprise with this bodysuit they looked amazing and I felt so confident not wearing a bra. I did have the tiniest amount of side boob showing, but it wasn’t anything crazy! I got this in a size L and just for reference, I’m 5’3 and around 210 lbs. In my opinion, it is true to size and the material is so soft and stretchy! Everyone should have one of these in their closet. You’ll be happy you purchased this, I know I am!",positive
22,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",ReoRia Women's Sexy Sleeveless Racer Back Halter Neck Bodysuit Tank Tops,$19.99 - $25.99,5,"So, I’ve only ever worn shape wear meant to NOT be seen. And have very limited experience with that even. I’ve wanted a bodysuit forever but haven’t done it bc my mom tummy is ALWAYS frustrating in everything. Finally said “it’s cheaper than most but highly rated so just try it!” I AM FLOORED. This thing is amazing. I know there are higher quality out there, but for this price the quality is great. Soft, stretchy, but substantial fabric. I ordered a L (my normal top size) and it fits nicely and looks good. But it was super long in the torso for me. I’ve never had this issue elsewhere with shapewear or bathing suits. I ordered a M in another color and that one is even better. Fits in the torso and even makes my mom tummy look snatched. I’m ordering one in all the colors! Haha. I’m 5’4”, 175lbs, 36D bust for reference. I carry most of my weight in that dang mommy midsection. Just get it! It’s phenomenal!",positive
23,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",ReoRia Women's Sexy Sleeveless Racer Back Halter Neck Bodysuit Tank Tops,$19.99 - $25.99,5,"Um, I'm OBSESSED with this. I definitely can't wear it without a bra though. Maybe if I'd ordered black but not in light purple.
By the size chart I thought I should be an XXL - I'm just shy of 5'6 and somewhere around 175+ ish lbs and a 34/36B, waist around 33-35 in hips around around 42-43 in . But looking at reviews I got an XL and I'm going to keep it, but I think an L will be a better fit. There's a little bit of awkward gapping around the arm/breast line but I like it too much to return and wait for a new one. It's perfect for the heatwave we're having right now - feels light but supportive and super cute. I'm super happy with it- I just might order others, especially darker colors, in a smaller size next time.
AND it has snaps at the bottom so you don't need to take the whole thing off to use the bathroom. Such a win.",positive
24,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",ReoRia Women's Sexy Sleeveless Racer Back Halter Neck Bodysuit Tank Tops,$19.99 - $25.99,5,"The material is thick and very soft. Has a shelf bra built in. I’m short but busty (5’4, 36DD) so while the M top fit great in the body, it was a tad snug around my chest. I did wear it with a strapless bra for extra support but maybe I’ll try it with just the shelf bra next time.

I think the L would be to big in the waist for me so I would definitely order the medium again (36DD, 32, 43 168lbs)",positive
25,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",ReoRia Women's Sexy Sleeveless Racer Back Halter Neck Bodysuit Tank Tops,$19.99 - $25.99,5,I was pleasantly surprised when unboxing this bodysuit. It’s made of a great material that feels like good quality and it’s double lined. It’s stretchy and is a staple for the closest. The only downside I had it that the extra lining around the bra area can make the top of the bodysuit lay weird on the body and show the lines where the extra fabric is if not adjusted to lay more flat on the body. But for the price I would say it’s very much worth it to have in your closet!,positive
26,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",ReoRia Women's Sexy Sleeveless Racer Back Halter Neck Bodysuit Tank Tops,$19.99 - $25.99,4,"Very (happily) surprised by this item - the first clothing item I've ever kept from Amazon! I got a lot of compliments. Might have it buy it again in more colors as a staple to my summer wardrobe...

First, it's SO comfortable (or as comfortable as a bodysuit can be) I wore it all day long and felt amazing because the material is buttery soft. The front is double-layered so not see-through and helps keep it smooth. I didn't wear a bra with this, and my nips still showed a little bit and I wasn't fully lifted, but it had a more natural-yet-supported look that I was down for.

I'm normally closer to an XL, but I bought the white in a L and I highly suggest doing so. This kept my chest supported vs. the XL I bought in another color and that one let my chest sink and the torso was way TOO long. It does gape a little at the armpits as some others have noted in reviews, but sizing down should help with this / I just pulled down on the sides and it was fixed.

Also bought in ""20-brown"" and it's definitely more rust colored than tan as I had thought it could possibly be (hard to tell colors online).",positive

This bodysuit is very flattering, comfortable, not see through, stretchy, and cute! The ONLY complaint I have is that it's a little loose near the armpit with a bit extra fabric. Love that I don't feel like I have to wear a bra with this top, but I think it's still maybe smart to wear it with pasties. Very soft material and at least on me it kind of feels like it has some form of body control? love it!",positive

This one however, has such a long crotch(?) area lol I know TMI. But these are the best, they don’t rid up, and give just the right amount of support.",positive

These Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts did just that. They are true to size according to the the size chart, and they did not shrink after the first three washings. I'm please with the purchase and I do plan to buy more. I should also add that I've purchase Gildan crew t-shirts in the past and they were a bit heavier and thicker than these. That's neither good nor bad, I just want to point this new characteristic out just in-case you also have some in your closet and are expecting the same shirts.

I tried getting a couple of shirts from Kohl’s but he did not like those and again the material was a bit too heavy. These fit perfect and the material is lightweight enough that my husband does not feel waited down by heavy material when he sweats or gets rained on. On that note, he is extremely happy with the material because it is not see-through and when it gets wet it dries out super fast! He wears these every day and I know I will be purchasing more! Oh yeah, the sizing is spot on as my husband is 5 foot 10 and about 155 pounds and usually wears a medium, that’s what I purchased and it is exactly what he needed!",positive

I normally wear a medium or large depending on the shirts designs/brand. I bought a pack of medium on my first purchase and they fit comfortable and filled in nicely while still being breathable and a little bit body shaping, not like a skin tight suit, just fitted. I then was curious and decided to purchase a large and the large was only slightly bigger a little bit more loose form fitting but not as body form fitting kept both of them.

I try to get away from the overly loose fitting shirts or undershirts because they look sloppy or overly baggy. A jump from medium to large are now being designed over big. Gildan shirts are fitted properly in the correct size. If you have the Amazon prime, I would recommend try before you buy and buy a pack of medium and large or if you're in the middle of small and medium. A medium in my body 6 inch height, 185 pounds average thinner frame, with average built, no belly. The medium was fitted closely resembling the model in the Amazon image. And the large was slightly looser in the waist and the arm.

Had both for over 2 months and have zero complaints and waiting to buy a set of black shirts. I'm only using these shorts for sleeping at night time or lounging around the house. If you need to go buy some food or maybe to a corner store they're passable. I don't really see any reason not to use these shirts in combination with a nice pair of shorts or jeans and use them for a bar or maybe even a restaurant. The only thing I could recommend is to measure or use the correct sizes and buy based off how you wanted it to fit. For me, the medium size was slightly loose but body shaping. large was looser, but not overly baggy.",positive

40,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Women's Floral Print Puff Sleeve Kimono Cardigan Loose Cover Up Casual Blouse Tops,$9.99 - $19.98,5,"I got two of these tops. The white one was more of a pebbled “peached” type of polyester. Could not wash out the harsh set-in wrinkles (MANY). So I ironed the top, while still damp, over and over again to really get rid of them. Finally did, and the top looked great when I wore it the first time yesterday. Will go with so many summer clothes.

My favorite was the patterned topper that had many colors in it, and had the look of a Monet painting. Its material was different from the solid white. More a typical chiffon. It arrived with very few wrinkles, in a nice plastic pouch. After washing this one, I also ironed it while still damp. Wrinkles came out right away. Though the material appears sheer, the pattern hides what’s under it a bit. Instead of wearing a sleeveless top under it, I wore a tee shirt. I thought the short sleeves might make it look stupid, but the voluminous sleeves of the top hid them, and you could just see the main blue body of my tee. So you can layer an amazing amount of colors and top styles underneath.

Fit: I am between a L and XL; I recommend you order a size up. The XL works right for me.",positive

I've tried it on with a beige, navy and white tees and looks nice with all three. I'm 100% happy with this piece and it elevates a plain tee or tank to a more polished look.

Well, I was very pleased with every aspect of this wispy, pretty garment. I examined the seams carefully and they were all neat and well sewn, nothing was falling apart, everything was fine. One thing I don't understand is why they advertise it as ""puff sleeve"". A puffed sleeve is a set in sleeve with gathers at the top of the sleeve where is sewn into the rest of the garment. I just put it down to foreign language misunderstanding. Anyway, I am pleased with the look and received compliments when I wore it to meet friends for lunch.

50,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Hey Dude Men's Wally Sox Onyx Multiple Colors | Men’s Shoes | Men's Lace Up Loafers | Comfortable & Light-Weight,$35.96 - $109.82,5,"So I definitely read the reviews for these. Not sure I wanted to have something saying ‘Hey Dude’ on my feet. Just went to Disney and had to wear tennis shoes bc I couldn’t find anything good to slip on and use. Tried the Snunks and although they aren’t too bad, not good for walking in any length of time, at least for me. I did wear my Birkenstocks (the plastic ones) a couple days but the walking was a bit too much and was worried they would fly off in a ride. So…shoes.
One of the people we were with had a pair of these and they looked pretty good. So I asked his about them and after he said they were legit, I did my research.
Ok, here’s what I like (Pros)
- they do look good
- they are definitely comfy
- super easy and convenient
- I can wear with van shoe socks
- I can wear without socks
- they are extremely light
- they pass my daughters cool te
List I sort of have an issue (Cons)
- I have to adjust to keep on feet
- the colors I want seem to be more expensive
- can’t wear with jeans, at least I can’t.

I figured out the adjustment. Just tie the knot a little further up. Makes the string stick out more but I’m ok with that.
I no longer wear wide leg pants so these don’t allow my pant leg to cover the shoe so I feel like my pants bunch up. So I won’t wear with pants…bummer but it’s just me.
I wear 11 in 99% of all shoes. When there’s no half size in shoes, 11s are usually a smidge too big and of course 10s are WAY too small. The 11s fit perfect. I’d say if you’re a .5, just round up.
Anyway, I know there’s like 49,000 reviews, hope this helps. I wear them all the time. I’ll be buying more (3 pairs already).",positive

They are about that lightweight, if I'm being honest. They are crazy comfy as well, like an extra squishy memory foam.

They don't do much in terms of heavy support, they're more... Hammocky? I have high arches and they don't suck to walk in, and I go all over in them, with or without socks. I don't like to run in them or bike in them as much, you really start to feel the lack of any skank in them at that point.

Lastly I'll touch on fit.

They run wide, but A very slight bit short in length.

I have a size 11 in most shoes and boots and tend to prefer wide cuts as well, and these fit me nearly perfectly, i did take up the entire footbed in the shoe and found them a touch smaller than most shoes I wear in length, maybe an eighth inch, or maybe a quarter inch less but it was noticable.",positive

Over the years that has slowly descended into a 1/2 Keg. But I was still buying the same ole brand and size of Briefs I'd been wearing since the 6 pack was around. They would fit, Kind of. Maybe I was just in denial I grew a bit. Ummm. Things got tight. HAHA.

But what REALLY forced me to look for a change was the ""H"" brand I was using changed the actual construction of the style I'd worn for years. Side-by-side, they even looked smaller. The seams in the back which use to be comfortable now gave me wedgies. I HATE wedgies. I received enough of those in the football locker room, don't need anymore.

So, I searched, read the reviews and decided to try these out. OHMYGAWD!!! It's like going from a Studio apartment to a Mansion. SO comfortable that I'm mad I tortured myself for so long.

1. Get a tape measure.
2. Measure your CURRENT waist.
3. See Chart.
4. BUY THESE!!!

I am a 39"" waist, so I could have gone either Large or XL. I chose XL. They are just barely a little loose, but I think I made the right choice. Even though they are loose, but not baggy, the elastic waste band fits perfect. I HATE tight waist bands ALMOST as much as wedgies!

I do love the way it fits elsewhere, very flattering, comfortable and breathable. It doesn't ride up and the length is perfect to wear with high waisted leggings. It's functional AND sexy!

Some under arm/chest spillage, and it rides up in the back. It has a built in shelf bra with elastic in the front and back so the back isn’t smooth.

Enter these stickies. I honestly didn’t have high hopes, but imagine my surprise when these suckers made my bathing suit look *FLAWLESS*. I swear they not only are capable of giving these old girls a little lift, but they make absolutely no lines under my bathing suit too!

I mean, frankly they also hang on on rivers, in lakes, and in the ocean. They stick when wet.

And not just water wet… Texas was over here breaking record head all summer. Which is a lot when you grew up in Houston anyway. These held up under so many cute outfits! I wound up buying a second pair because they became my favorite summer bra. I would forget I was wearing them, and no struggle with a wet bra from sweat, or shimmying up a strapless that fell down to my waist.

Also the edges of the cover are peeling away, so there is silicone missing from the sides. I will probably try a different brand next time. For the amount of time that these last, I'd like them to be about $15 rather than $30+.

Based on all of the stellar reviews, I decided to take a chance on these and I am so glad I did. I’ve never liked bras, switched about 4 years ago to wearing sports bras/bralettes only. But I hate the feeling of straps digging into me. Now that I have these, it’s unlikely I’ll ever wear a bra again. I’m hoping they last forever because I want to use them forever. Firstly, it’s very fun/funny to see yourself with ‘Barbie boobs’ as I call them. Secondly, the adhesive works great and has taken many washes and still is holding up great. It’s not sticky enough to hurt badly when you remove them. You cannot see the edges through a shirt. They work so well and honestly help with chafing a lot, I hate going braless in certain shirts because of the shirt texture. I am 5ft10 and weight around 165 and my ladies are C-D, so I chose the larger size and it was perfect. I do wish the container was a bit larger, I can never seem to get them perfect on the plastic thingy so they don’t fit well into the case. They have held up very well through sweat, but there will be peeling after you’ve sweat. Even sweating profusely, they still hang on a bit.

Nobody should feel shame or be shamed for their body, even their visible nips! That said, sometimes, for me, there are times I’m more comfortable with good nip shields. THESE are the BEST. The ones I’ve had on the past didn’t offer the coverage I needed, even in a structured/moulded bra. Ladies, I’m wearing an unlined, lace bra right now, at work, in a cold office and nobody would know. I feel better about my body wearing this bra. I feel happier wearing this bra. My life has changed since wearing this bra and the ONLY REASON I can do this and feel great is because of these sticky beauties. Get them, throw on the thinnest bra, or NO BRA at all, and go out into the world (where woman’s bodies are over sexualized and judged) feeling like a bad ass.",positive

I live in a humid southern state and even when swearing these do not move! Wash them after wearing with mild soap and let them air dry. I haven’t had them lose their adhesion and just let them air dry! It’s way too hot to wear a bra sometimes so these are definitely it under backless shirts, dresses, and thin tank tops. I love being able to wear shirts with confidence especially if wearing white tops! I have never felt so confident. I am a DD and these are my go too especially having larger aureolas. Also a plus…no back fat from wearing a dang bra! They cover awesome.
Don’t wear lotion on your breasts to avoid the issues people tend to have or self tanners..it could stain the out side or also cause the adhesion to break down. I have had them since May 2022 and use them a lot! These do not disappoint if you take care of them.",positive

They stay on all day and aren’t noticeable (you won’t feel them and other people won’t see them). Love them for backless things or deep cut sides or just spaghetti straps or strapless. I have noticed that they kinda start to come off if you’re getting really sweaty but you can just take them off for a sec and wipe off your skin and the pasty and then put it back on. At the end of the day/night, especially if I did sweat a lot, I just wash it gently with plain soap and water and let it air-dry. I also always store it in the container it came in, with the sticky part covered by the little plastic sheet and then put in the plastic cups, stacked, and inside the black magnetic box. I’ve had them for over a year now and still have no issues! If you have larger breasts, these will most likely not offer any support.

I’m living where it’s very humid and was concerned it would come off after an hour. It stayed over 6 hours! It’s never came off on their own. I wonder if some of the people that left reviews are having problems with adhesion are not re sticking it back to the plastic bag thing it originally came with. I’ve had 0 problems reusing this!

07/25/22 Wear #1: I was very surprised how well these worked, were comfortable, removed, blended with my skin - ALL THE THINGS. hey are sheer/translucent, not opaque - my areola are ""visible"" through these, but the Nippies ""soften"" the contrast of skin and areola.
I wore them under a thin, knit (1 layer) summer sundress. I couldn't tell where the Nippies ended and I began. I rinsed & rubbed them under cool water, dried, and put them on the little half-spheres to rest until there next trip out.
The A-C size is perfect for me. The larger size would work well also.
These were amazing and absolutely worth the cost.

90,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",BRONAX Cloud Slides for Women and Men | Shower Slippers Bathroom Sandals | Extremely Comfy | Cushioned Thick Sole,$23.99 - $24.99,5,"I am a regular size 9 so naturally I ordered the 9-10s. When I got them, something was kinda off. These were just a tad too short so my heel was right on top of the lip on the back. Later on that day I ordered the 10.5-11.5s so I could try those instead. I got them yesterday and holy hell it took me all day to decide which ones to keep. The bigger pair is BIG but my feet fit perfectly into the insole and they’re a lot more comfortable. The strap is a little more loose, naturally but not too much of an issue for me. I’d walk around in one pair then switch off, each time I’d think ok these feel a lot better, no THESE feel a lot better. The strap on the smaller pair fits nicely, not too snug but the fact that my heel hangs off the back just a teensy bit makes all the difference. It’s definitely uncomfortable. I’m going with the 10.5-11.5s.

I did read a lot of other reviews to get more info as I am worried that the larger pair will stretch out. From what I’ve gathered, it sounds like none of these sandals are actually all made the same, all sizes are not the same exact size, there’s deformities in each sandal. I guess we just need to deal with the trial and error if we receive a wonky pair.

All in all I’m happy with the bigger pair. They’re extremely comfortable and I love the color. I work from home, I’m in a new house and my resolution is to keep the floors more clean, everyone must take their shoes off at the door so these are a great option for inside house slippers. I definitely won’t be wearing them out in public or even the backyard.",positive

I’m going to start with the negative. The leopard print slippers don’t look quite like the ad photo. The ones I got were more of a yellowish color instead beige and it’s just not very cute. Had I known, I would have chosen a different color/pattern. I usually wear 7.5 shoes, so I ordered the 7.5-8.5. If my feet were any bigger, my foot would be overlapping the edge of the shoe. So the size was perfect for me, but if you are an 8 or 8.5, you might want to go up a size.
They’re also kind of awkward to walk in. They feel a bit…weird. Hard to explain, but it takes a bit more effort to walk in them than my other slippers.
Now the positive…
When you stand up in them, it feels like you’re standing on a squishy full cloud! They’re going to be great for cooking and doing dishes, when I am standing for long periods of time.

Although there are more Cons than Pros for me, overall I am ok with my purchase. I won’t walk around in them much, I won’t show them off in public, but for the price, I will be happy to take some pressure off my feet and ankles while I’m in the kitchen!",positive

I got these to wear in the house and I just ordered another pair to wear around outside. Very comfortable I also got another brand in same size but sending them back because they do not fit or feel as comfortable as these. Right now my feet are not as swollen but I know when they do swell these are still gonna fit cause they are not tight fitting. I'm really satisfied and the price was not bad.

I’m a size 7.5 in most shoes and was torn between getting the women’s 6-7 or 7.5-8.5. I eventually decided to get the 7.5-8.5 size to account for the raised edge and for any shrinkage that might happen because it’s so hot and humid in NY lately. They’re very roomy around the band but otherwise they fit perfectly. They do however look very big when I’m not wearing them but once they’re on your feet, they look normal-ish. I don’t mind since I plan to only wear them indoors. They’re also very supportive and comfortable to walk in.

So very odd that the perimeter of the show has to grow with the length, but I bought to walk around in my kitchen so they serve the purpose. The second pair didn't come in a box.

All I can say is that they are brilliant. They fit perfectly, feel very comfortable and have reinforced heels. They were comfortable to wear on a 9+ hour flight. I was very pleasantly surprised.

I’m 5’6” and 220lbs. Yeah I know I need to lose weight but I mention this because the heavier you are the more your feet have to carry. In that regard they are way better than other socks I have which will now be headed to the bin.

They are stretchable but not tightly ""elastic,"" so can come off easily in mud (think feet sinking into lake bottom a half inch or an inch) or if jump off watercraft and do a little swimming with something like a scissors kick. They seem to protect my soles from small sunken tree branches on the lake bottom while launching/landing kayak. If I decide to cool my heels by dumping my feet overboard for a moment, if I leave my feet on the hull just outside the kayak so water runs back into the lake rather than the kayak, the shoes ""drain"" back into the lake in a matter of a few seconds, and I get almost no water inside the kayak bringing my feet/shoes back inside after that few seconds.

When I look for my next pair, will try to get something that comes higher on the foot toward the ankle, so less worry about them slipping off in muck (have had some close calls) or while swimming (have come almost completely off).

The insoles are removable, which is fine, but they're hard to get back in and aligned correctly. And every time I take the shoes off, the insoles start to come out as well.

Otherwise, though, they're basically socks with soles, and if you like to go barefoot but want some protection from things that could harm you, these are great.

I'd be interested to know if one could wear them through TSA lines, since they do look like socks.

They won't last as long as I'd hope. Wish the manufacturer could extend the rubber material up to the toe area to stop that from happening. Another issue I started to have was that the top of the liner on the insert is separating from itself on one of the shoes so while I'm swimming I can feel it bunching up under my feet. I'll probably rip it off since its pretty much separated anyway so hopefully that won't make it super uncomfortable. These are form fitting and super comfortable considering they are very light. I'd actually wear these around the house to have grip on my hardwood floor! I normally wear a 9.5 in women's shoes and I purchased the 9-10 Womens size and they fit perfectly! These are essentially socks with rubber bottoms that stay on your feet quite snug. I wouldn't wear these for major outdoor activities.

However, the insole in one of the pair in the opened package was much too large and caused a fold right at the center of the bottom of my foot. This may have been why they were returned.

My initial reaction is it's smaller than I expected, (it wasn't much bigger than my iPhone 13) but it will definitely hold a phone, small wallet, lip gloss, and a few other essentials. I like that it's really minimalistic and simple. I have probably 10-20 fanny packs, in various colors/prints/sizes. This is a great option for someone wanting a simple, small waist pack.

The material is somewhat water resistant and feels durable. The strap is nice and thick and feels very sturdy. It also adjusted well and holds in place. There's a zippered pocket on the body facing size, and a main zipper on the outside. The main zip is metal and hefty. The inside has two mesh pockets to help organize. All in all this is a great quality bag for the price.

151,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",ODODOS Unisex Mini Belt Bag with Adjustable Strap Small Waist Pouch for Workout Running Travelling Hiking,$18.98,4,"I’m SOO impressed with the quality of this bag! The straps are so comfortable and soft, and the bag material is outstanding. I love that it’s not super stiff material and is easy to access your stuff. This would be ideal for the airport or a hike. The color looks pretty much the same that I ordered.

There’s a ton of room on the inside surprisingly. I love that when you open up the main pocket, there’s three pouches on the inside for smaller things like headphones, chapstick, keys, medicine, etc. It helps so much to keep organized. There’s also an outside zipped pocket for more stuff.

I’ve worn the lululemon belt bag and I gotta say, this is pretty similar. Even the quality is pretty close. Almost identical besides the the lululemon is a tiny bit smaller size, and the zipper. The lululemon one has a plastic zipper but this Amazon one is metal. I prefer the plastic but this one is okay.

3 CONS:
1. Something that can be improved is there being a plus size option. I know this bag is meant for your “hip”, but no one wears it like that now days haha. I’m a size L/XL for tops and the bag is at the full length it can go. I wouldn’t want it any smaller.

2. As I mentioned earlier, I would personally really like a plastic zipper instead of a metal zipper. That might just be a me thing though.

3. This isn’t necessarily a con as it is me just being spoiled buuuut the shipping was longer than I’m used to with prime. It said it would take about a month but got delivered at about 2 1/2 weeks. Well worth the wait but it was strange for being prime.

Other than that, I’m so so happy with the bag and would suggest it to my friends. It might be better than lululemon JUST for the fact that they have so many color options!",positive

However, online the price of those bags put me off. I read this is a pretty good knockoff. It did take basically a month to get here and at the time I ordered many colors were out of stock. I ordered black because it's hard to go wrong with that color. I love the material. I wish the large zipper pocket was divided. I have another bag of similar size with one large zipper pocket and one large snap button pocket for easy to grab items like sunglasses and I like that better than cramming everything in one area. The smaller zipper slot on the outside is not very helpful because once the main compartment is full this side pocket becomes tight and very difficult to use. I slide my phone in there and it is very small, yet I still have to leave it unzipped. I am able to squeeze in keys with very large fob, small minimalist wallet, square medication container, and small pocket knife. That's it. Phone and sunglasses quite honestly don't really fit.",positive
153,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",ODODOS Unisex Mini Belt Bag with Adjustable Strap Small Waist Pouch for Workout Running Travelling Hiking,$18.98,5,"Absolutely loving it! Saw a friend with the coveted lululemon bag and it was sold out. Found this one and purchased for summer festivals and fairs. Now I've found I'm using it daily. Purchased a larger, more expensive sling bag from North Face (that could fit a diaper/wipes for park/zoo trips) and the zipper sticks often. This bag has never had an issue with zippers.

For reference, I store all of these items in it and use it as a daily purse.
- samsung galaxy phone
- makeup: concealer, sunscreen, moisturizer, mascara, Blush stick, eyeshadow stick, lipstick, chapstick
- little first aid kit: 2-3 single pack of meds, bandaids, antibacterial wipes
- essentials: sunglasses, keys with fob, ear plugs
- zipper pocket holds about 8 cards with ample room for cash and coins

Even with all that I could probably put in more items, as all my makeup is tall/thin stick form so they stack nicely in the longer mesh pocket.

I needed it for a trip on 8/17 and the original estimated delivery was mid-end of August so I panicked a little but read from other reviews that delivery is actually much quicker than anticipated.

For those wondering, I ordered on 7/16 and got it on 7/29 to NY so just about 2 weeks total. Between that time, they kept updating the delivery date to a shorter time period. They shipped on 7/27 for me. So don't let the far delivery date scare you.

For the product itself, it's cute, functional, and I can hold a decent amount of items in it without looking bulky (card holder, extra mask, hand sanitizer, lotion, eye drops, chapstick, some makeup,etc). I agree with another reviewer that it would be better with two zippers so you can open it on either ends especially when you wear it as a cross-shoulder and want to switch up which shoulder you want to wear it. Not a big deal though!

156,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",ODODOS Unisex Mini Belt Bag with Adjustable Strap Small Waist Pouch for Workout Running Travelling Hiking,$18.98,4,"Detailed Review:

ARRIVAL: I bought this bag just before Lulu released their True Navy color for the upcoming fall season. Ordered 7/30 and arrived 8/11 much earlier than the expected Sept arrival.

COLOR: It is definitely a navy, but more of a “faded” navy (medium navy with gray undertones) than a rich dark navy as we expect. Still beautiful to be neutral friendly and universal with any outfit keeping this specific color tone in mind.

FIT (see photos): I am 5’2”/195 lbs/US12/36D bust. With it fully extended, I still had room for a fist (5-6 inches) in the front. I’d say that it could fit up to a 14/16, but depends on your bust size.

Outfit 1 Photo: you can see the gray undertone when compared with with “true (dark) navy” sweatpants.
Outfit 2: it’s a perfect match with my “faded navy” sweatshirt.
Accessory Comparison Photo: compared to my navy nails and watch wrist band, you can see that it shifts to the gray undertone.",positive

1. You can wear this around your hips like a traditional fanny pack OR wear it crossbody like a bougie millennial mom (*raises hand*)
2. I like that there's an interior pocket as well as an exterior pocket to keep things either super secure or easily accessible
3. It's just big enough to fit essentials: small wallet, phone, lip balm, keys, etc.

I went with her true street shoe size and they are a smidge too big. If they had half sizes, I think a half size down would’ve been perfect. But, one full size down would be too tight most likely. So, for the sizes available, I think they were the best choice. They aren’t huge, but she has some room if her feet grow a bit which is a plus I guess.

Now I've got wide feet that sort of look like a box, but not quite, kinda like Fred Flintstone. I usually wear a 9 to accommodate my wide feel, but if they're wide I can wear an 8.5. After reading the reviews I ordered my regular size 9s, so imagine my surprise when these puppies were not only too big in length, but too wide!

Pros:
Cute shoes!
Lots of styles and color choices.
May be comfortable......?

Cons:
Expensive.
Sizing is off.
No real support for your arch.

I'm gonna bypass those cons because I can get them cheap, I'll exchange for a smaller size, and I'll put my orthotics in there and be comfortable!

The sizing and fit seem off on this sports bra. The cups were too large on the sides – lots of extra room – so it would not provide the amount of support I would need.

The bottom band was too loose. There is no way I could workout in this sports bra.

It is a comfortable bra, I love that there are different prints and colors. I honestly have no complaints. I ran this evening and I do not have any black eyes and my back does not hurt. I will call that a win.

No cons. I would say that as advertised it is medium impact, there are removable pads, it is comfortable, it was not cutting into my back and the fabric is soft.

220,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Amazon Essentials Men's Regular-Fit Cotton Pique Polo Shirt,$8.87 - $16.30,5,"In my day polos used to be soft thick 100 % cotton with generous sleeves covering the upper arm till above the elbows and collars standing high and grand and covering the back of the neck till below the hairline. They had substantial structure/body (shape that held) and ultra comfortable soft cotton. This was my go to piece of clothing to step out in (as opposed to round neck collarless T-Shirts that I wore only at home or for sporting activities).

However, this simple good thing was not to be taken for granted. As time went by, I watched in horror this simple evergreen staple slowly vanish - being replaced by plastic, toxic, carcinogenic trash (synthetic, polyester, 'performance', 'hi-tech') being passed as clothing riding solely on deceptive/misleading/convincing marketing and rapidly transient 'fast fashion trends'. These pieces of junk being passed as 'performance polos'/'hi-tech' had no 'body', clung to your skin like plastic, caused my sensitive skin to itch, with arms so short as if there was shortage of clothing material in the world and were of such thin cheap uncomfortable material that I would wonder how in the world do people put these on their bodies.

The 'trend' continued ...

Fast forward to the present day, finding the 'cotton polo of my youth' is like finding a dinosaur. The polo I grew up with is practically extinct - replaced by trash made with ever cheaper feeling and more toxic materials. Its a win win for the corporates/brands - cheap synthetic lab created materials astronomically marked up (riding on advertisement) - filling the corporate pockets unlike never before and successfully 're-programming' the minds and purchasing behavior of the new generation to accept, get used to, and even get addicted to such toxic 'hi-tech' trash. As for the manufacturing ? No problem - hire some MBA's (with zero knowledge/passion for good quality textile/garment manufacturing) - their sole purpose to be 'maximizing profits' for the next 'earnings report' and they would find the 'cheapest' offshore factory to outsource the manufacturing to. This being a continuous process - if you get a cheaper bid from another factory, just switch to it. No wonder you can never get consistent material, sizing, quality for the exact same product purchased even months apart.

Not just that - even brands that sold fantastic quality 100 % cotton polos at a very reasonable price like Tommy Hilfiger etc went STEEP DOWNHILL. A Tommy Hilfiger polo being sold today is NOWHERE NEAR anything like the quality they had even a few years ago (even though still being theoritically 100 % cotton, the quality (material, cut) now is absolutely junk - in fact they went from being my favorite Polo Shirts (thick, soft, cloud like cotton with generous neck and sleeves and amazing body, texture and shape and in high quality colors and finish) to absolutely shockingly unwearable pieces of garbage (thin, rough, itchy cotton with skimpy sleeves and flat collars and dull cheap finsih and colors with NO lusture, body whatsoever).

I always wish I had seen this day come. I would have stocked up on a lifetim's supply of 'real' clothing when they were still available.

Given the above, I am extremely surprised (pleasantly) by this Amazon Essentials Cotton Polo. This is 100 % cotton, has generous non-skimpy sleeves and has decent material and shape reminiscent of the 100 % cotton polo I am habituated to from my time. Quality of material wise - it is about 65% - 70% of the cotton polos of yesteryears - BUT - even THAT - is like finding diamond (or a dinosaur) in these abhorrent-clothing-times for the 100 % cotton polo lover.

Get this before the 'real cotton polo' is gone for good. I think I may be getting a few.",positive
221,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Amazon Essentials Men's Regular-Fit Cotton Pique Polo Shirt,$8.87 - $16.30,5,"I have about fifteen of these shirts. I wear polo shirts with jeans for work everyday in the Spring and Summer and I really like 100% cotton. I won't wear anything with a polyester blend in a polo. It's getting harder and harder to find affordably priced all cotton polos and these Amazon polos have been great. I tend to like the pinks, yellows and coral colors but the colors are diverse and they hold up well. Like any cotton product, they definitely will shrink in the dryer to a point but then they don't shrink. I'm 5'9, 180 pounds and the medium is perfect for me after it shrinks. Occasionally, I will stretch out the shirt just a little after it comes out of the dryer so its looser in the arms but that's similar with all polos with the stretch band in the bicep area. At any rate, the shirts are tailored nicely and wear very well. I continue to buy them and use them for work and weekends. Excellent shirts.....",positive

In the extremely hot, humid weather we have had recently, pique sems to let air pass through well, giving the feeling of being cooler. Colours are true. I am an ""ice cream"" colour person, so deep colours are not for me, but I bought a heathered red and the colour did not run onto other clothes when I washed it with other polo shirts.

You will have to hang them up when you get them, they need some rack time for the folded lines to naturally go away. I question how durable and long lasting they will be also.

Cute, easy to clean, non-fabric material, simple and at first VERY comfortable. I was pleased, and I wore them the entire first day as I cleaned. The only potential problem I noticed at first was that my big toes would rub on the insides a bit so I tried to fix that with socks (I have flat feet), and that made it more comfortable. I then noticed my heels would sink further down than the rest of my feet, and when I walked it was almost as if my feet were fighting the straps that lay over my feet. None of this, however, was bothersome enough to keep me from wearing them as I went about my day.
The next morning I woke up and the tops of my feet specifically, were throbbing. I could hardly move my feet in an upward position, or move my toes and when I did, my feet were in a lot of pain. I went shopping with my family that day where I had to do a lot of walking and I had to sit in the car and take my walking shoes off several times to massage my feet from the pain.

231,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Joomra Pillow Slippers for Women and Men Non Slip Quick Drying Shower Slides Bathroom Sandals | Ultra Cushion | Thick Sole,$19.99 - $24.99,5,"Final Update:
Wait until these mold to your feet before judging. They are great for me, and I see them as a perfect slipper because they slide on, there is enough room for socks in winter, they are zero drop yet cushioned, and they mold to your feet after a few days of wear, which increases stability and stops the feeling of them shuffling around. I am actually able to lift weights on my concrete patio in these without laying down a mat because they cushion some well. That said, I do not think a size ten foot would fit these. I’m always a size 9 and these are exactly perfect in terms of fit.

Update:
I’m leaving the other entries so you can see my process, which was essentially that I didn’t “get” them at first. Now, just a day later, and I am LOVING these. I couldn’t wait to get my feet into them at the end of the day. They make me happy :).

Update:
This is a next-day update. So far, I do love the soles of these for standing at the sink and standing desk and at the bathroom mirror. I removed the foam inserts because they weren’t doing the trick. These are not good for walking because they are loose and slide around. The sole does fit my foot just right: I’m always always a size 9 women’s medium, no matter the shoe, so I don’t think this would be big enough for a size 10. It would be too big for a size 8. Someone should invent these with a comfy, wide *stretchy* neoprene strap that is adjustable with Velcro or something to make these work better, but they are what they are.

Original:
Yes, the sole is very comfy. I would say these are worth $15; I just spent over an hour using an old mat to create customized shims in order to wear these without the strap being useless. I have an average size 9 female foot. I have included pics to show you what the customized foam looks like in case it is helpful to anytime. If these work with the foam, great🤞!
(BTW, the foam does not require adhesive as it is thick and stiff enough to simply stay there bc of the slight tension of the arch).",positive

Hate returning so I’m keeping both sizes for me and ordering another smaller size for her (as we don’t want her to trip with them being too big). Shipping was super fast; handled directly from Amazon.

PS: They do respond fast when you have questions but Amazon handles the shipping of product and if there are any returns.

235,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Joomra Pillow Slippers for Women and Men Non Slip Quick Drying Shower Slides Bathroom Sandals | Ultra Cushion | Thick Sole,$19.99 - $24.99,4,"I purchased three of these type of sandals all from different brands to see which we liked. Ended up keeping all three but here’s the rundown:
Purchased- Bronax, Joomra, and Cushionaire

All three are great. All are soft and cushy enough to be very comfortable. Personally I’d go with Bronax but may depend on what you’re using them for.

Cushionair was the most “sturdy” and I kept these as I’ll be using the slides out of the house going to and from work where I keep “work” shoes. If you want to wear them around town I suggest cushionair or Bronax. Cushionair being the most sturdy (while still comfy and smooshy). Bronax are more cushy than Cushionair but still sturdy enough to wear out and about and forced to choose I would choose Bronax sized up. The Joomra are verrrrry cushy and the least sturdy. Great for walking around the house or run to take out the garbage but maybe too smooshy to go out and about in them consistently.

Bronax and Joomra ran slightly small. I usually wear a womens 8, sometimes 7.5 and ordered what would be an 8 in all brands. Bronax and Joomra did technically fit but with no room for error. They fit my kid perfectly who wears a 7 womens.

As I said, we actually liked all of them and I ended up keeping one and 2 of my kids ended up taking the other pairs as they liked them that much.",positive

Second, I rarely write reviews because there is no reason, usually. But this time there is a reason.

Now on to the review.
I purchased these to replace my Jesus sandals. I was skeptical because of some of the reviews, but opted to try them out. Well let me tell you I’m glad I did.

Let’s talk about the look. Not impressed by the looks of them but they are for around the house. Sometimes you have to wear ugly inside your house because beauty is pain. So I’ll happily wear the ugly in my home.

And to the comfort we go. HOLY CRAP! These are probably the most comfortable pair of slides I have. The cushion is amazing. I slipped out of my Jesus slippers and into these and was elevated in comfort. I love them. You’ll love them. If you do t love them it’s because you don’t know what true comfort is. Slide back up to the top and hit buy now or place them in your cart. You need some comfort in your life cause it’s hard being a bad b all day every day and sometimes you just gotta let it loose at home so you can relax. I’m fixed to buy a few more pairs to match the house clothes. Color coordination is important.

Happy shopping",positive
240,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Brooks Ghost 14 Women's Neutral Running Shoe,$94.17 - $318.72,4,"These are truly great shoes, especially for the treadmill, which was my goal when ordering them. However, no matter how tightly I tie the laces, they don't hold. Either they loosen, or untie completely. This means I have to pause my workout and re-tie the laces, which breaks my rhythm. This is why I give them 4 stars instead of 5.

I'm purchasing those elastic Lace Locks (just like on Keen sandals) and hope they do better. But I really do like the shoe otherwise. I went up half a size to 8 to make sure the toe box was roomy, and they fit very well.

UPDATE: Yesterday I tied them tightly before I left the house. Made one stop, then went to the gym, had to tighten and tie them again before 10 minutes of stretching, then a third time before getting on the treadmill. So I don't know whether I got a bad set of shoelaces, or they are just poor in general. Waiting now for my Lock Laces to arrive.",positive

I also have neuropathy in both feet. These shoes are extremely comfortable & though I'm still unable to walk for long on hard surfaces, they definitely help relieve the plantar. What surprised me the most though was how much it helped the neuropathy considering no other shoe I've tried has helped in the least, even ones advertised to do so. I'm planning to buy another pair as a spare in case these wear out. I love the cushioning, arch & ankle support and imagine runners would greatly benefit from these shoes. So why did I only give 4 stars instead of 5? Because of the shoelaces! Flat shoelaces are extremely difficult for me to work with as I have arthritis in my fingers. Why anyone would choose flat shoelaces over the rounded type is beyond me, but I've ordered some locklaces to replace them so it's all good. (Still, that's an extra $10 expense). Another thing to note: I tried size 8.5 med & 9 also but I found 8.5 wide gives ample room in the toe box and fits my foot perfectly. I always have a little heel slippage as I have narrow heels, so that's why it's important to me to have laces I can truly secure. Very happy with these, would recommend & buy again.",positive

260,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Niidor Adhesive Bra Strapless Sticky Invisible Push up Silicone Bra for Backless Dress with Nipple Covers Nude,$19.99 - $25.99,5,"First off, I really tested the heck out of this thing: The first time I wore it I kept in on for 24 hours, even sleeping in it. I washed it as per instructions, wore it again for a regular amount of time, washed and wore again. It's only slightly less sticky than it started and I feel like this will last for quite awhile. Absolutely no residue whatsoever on my skin, ever. I live in Florida...and it's summer. I'm really impressed by this thing.

I would say the fit is similar to a tee shirt bra.

I'm nearing 50 and D. While the bra doesn't lift me to great heights (because it can't defy gravity) it definitely keeps me neat and tucked where I should be without swinging around. There is nothing at all digging around my ribs like a vice grip, and nothing at all digging into my shoulders. It's total freedom for me! Under a fitting (dark) tank top it looks no different than any other bra. It never felt hot (and I'm a little heavy and going through menopause). After I've put it on, I've never had to give it another thought again. It never feels like it's slipping, or becoming unstuck -- and taking it off is a breeze. I thought it may hurt a little but not even in the slightest, and my skin there is like crepe paper.

I feel that for a smaller breasted person you could get some lift but mine are just too heavy. That being said, it doesn't NOT lift me up. Completely appropriate anywhere. Perhaps if I'd gone with a size smaller -- which I'll have to anyway as I'm losing weight -- I'd have more lift. If you're young, even if you're not perky you'll have better lift than me. Wanting more lift is the only thing that keeps this bra from performing miracles. But honestly, it's good enough considering all the problems it takes away. If you're on the larger side, this may not work for you at the office but at home or in a casual setting but I still see it doing all the same things for you as it does for me. You don't have to worry about any swing or jiggle unless you really try and yet there's no uni-boob either.

I haven't used the free shields that came with it because like I said, I'm 50 soon. That's like putting a band-aid on a bullet wound. However they feel to be of equal quality and would definitely do the job. I recommend the crap out of these things. If they last only half as long as I believe they will, it's well worth the money. Just get the bra -- and prepare to throw out all your archaic, traditionally structured boob cages . You won't wear them again any more than a corset or a chastity belt.

Friendly tip: do not go the extra mile; do NOT dry inside-out. What happens is because of the way they're molded, the outside of the cups and the (minimal) foamy stuff underneath will develop creases after awhile. With casual clothes you can't see it but if you were to wear something like silk or satin, the wrinkles would definitely show. However dry them the way they're meant to be worn and you won't have that problem.",positive

I really like this bra. I'm wearing it today. I happy with the way is looks underneath clothes. Update: I ordered a set of A cups.

I was very pleasantly surprised to find this sticky bra actually works very well! I was wearing a dress for a wedding and needed something to hold my chest together without showing straps. It fit my bust very well, covered me just enough but didn't peek out through the dress which had a low cleavage line. The clips are a nice touch too as they do add extra cleavage which is fun if you have a smaller chest like me.

I was also dancing a lot that night... this sticky bra performed very well and I had no worries about it slipping off even though I was sweating. When I came home, I did make sure to wash the bra as instructed to increase the life of the product.

I was a little sore after my night, there was a part that was rubbing against me a little too much throughout the evening but that also could be due to user error as I may not have put it on in an optimal area. Otherwise, very comfortable!

Box comes with a set of instructions (keep this) including on how to clean the bra after use, and how to put it on which was nice. I highly reccomend this product, I will definitely buy this again once my current on reaches the end of its rope.",positive
263,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Niidor Adhesive Bra Strapless Sticky Invisible Push up Silicone Bra for Backless Dress with Nipple Covers Nude,$19.99 - $25.99,5," At first I was skeptical. I have tried so many push up bras, strapless bras, even other weird “magical” sticky bras. I even tried that metal deep V shape bra that was supposed to work with big breast…. None ever worked.
I wasn’t going to try this one until I saw a woman with breast like mine wearing them. I was still skeptical because her breast looked a tad firmer than mine. I read her comments and she said to size up, so I did. I never realized my breast were bigger than I thought so my boobs popped out the top just a little bit it wasn’t too noticeable. So I’m ordering another one right now but a size bigger. If u have smaller, firmer breast go down a size to get them extra pulled together. If you are bigger, have bigger breast, or have “older” boobs (🤣🤣 children ruined mine) you probably want more coverage so again go up a size.
Also, I follow the instructions and clean them every time and I place the plastic wrap back on it to keep the longevity. Honestly I’m a E now I thought I was a DD and I can wear these all day if they were cleaned and stored properly. I chose to wrote the review because today is the first day in my entire adult life that I went outside in a spaghetti strap tank top BRALESS!!!! I felt sexy, I felt hot, men were starring at me again. I always cover up NOT ANYMORE 😁 My husband said “Damn, those look really good. Go put on another shirt.” My neighbor asked my name and we have been neighbors for 3 years 🤪😜😏 listen I’m happily married but it felt nice to have the confidence to go outside, to have people look at me again, n my husband turn red because he got jealous. Which in a way was good for us, we are together now for 15 years and it was cute to see him get flustered at my body again. I’m not saying my husband doesn’t love my body but he never gets to see it because I’m always hiding it. This bra has been a life changer and I hope my review helps someone else purchase one of these adhesive bra because you will NOT be disappointed at all.
Pros: easy to use, adhesive last a long time, they give my girls a lift, I feel confident and sexy, they are extremely comfortable, I feel secure and safe wearing it for hours outside.
Con’s: my boobs underneath get sweaty from being pushed together, sometimes my boobs feel like they poke out on top of the bra if not put on perfectly the first time.

My biggest con is that I didn’t buy this bra sooner!!

The video is from the first time I actually wore it out, you can see it took me time to figure out how to place it perfectly on my breast. Which was the hardest part for me but once I found my sweet spot it’s easy to stick them on and go. They are super comfortable.

P.s- if you are having a problem with support it could be because you aren’t putting it on right. When I first put it on I thought the same thing. I had to go on YouTube and watch some videos. I find it works best at a 45 degree angle with the clasp pointing more downward. Then I have to push and lift my breast to snap it in place then they stay perfectly 😍",positive

I will compare the Gilden T-shirt with the Fruit of the Loom Platinum that you will see at Wal-Mart.

Pro - The Gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two T-shirts that came in the package. The neck was smaller, without being tight. I am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up, unlike many Fruit of the Looms. There were no loose threads, unlike many Fruit of the Loom. Gilden has heavier fabric, which is better most of the year where I live (east Tennessee). I do not want a see-through T-shirt. Also, no one who sees me would want me wearing a see-through T-shirt.

Con - The Fruit of the Loom is much softer after a first washing. I washed the Gildan T-shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on Energy-Saving. Gilden has a tag which is not as good as Fruit of the Loom (no tag). I cut the tag out without any problem and now the Gilden is fine. Gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive.

Neutral - Neither brand bleeds color. I have only washed the Gilden one time so I do not know whether it will fade. My Fruit of the Loom T-shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur.

I hope that this review is helpful to you.

Update - June 2, 2020. The Gildan T-shirts that I bought previously held up reasonably well for the money. They did not shrink. They did not fade. However, they did not get softer. Washing was on warm and drying was three minutes on energy saver.

I purchased some more Gildans to replace the ones that wore out. I have not washed them yet. I bought Galapagos Blue and Orange in Large size. Both are 100% cotton. The necks seem smaller than the Fruit of the Loom Platinums that I own. I like that because I have a small head so I don't need a big neck. I am still 5'8"" and 140 pounds and the Large is comfortable for me. A medium would probably fit me better; however, I like a looser-fitting T-shirt.

I will let you know how well the new Gildans do after washing in warm water and drying for three minutes on energy saving heat.

Notably, I have some old Fruit of the Loom T-shirts (like ten years or more) which are reasonably thick, reasonably soft, and still going strong after all this time. I wish that I had bought more of them.

June 10, 2020 - After one wash in warm water and three minutes in the dryer, the new Gildans did not shrink or fade. Also, the necks did not stretch. However, the T-shirts did not become softer. Therefore, three out of the four results were good and one result was neutral.

September 20, 2020 - After multiple washings in warm water and three minutes in the dryer on ""energy saving"", the verdict is the same. Good - the T-shirts did not shrink or fade and the necks did not stretch. Bad - The T-shirts did not get any softer. One other note - the tags on the T-shirts would be very annoying to wear so I cut the tags out.

November 22, 2020 - The first thing to go bad on these T-shirts has been that the necks have stretched slightly. The stretching was not terrible but it is noticeable (at least to me). Nevertheless, I would give the T-shirts 4.5 stars. They do seem a little but softer or maybe I am getting more used to them. They do not feel scratchy to me. They have not faded or shrunk. I definitely like them much better than the ultra-thin Fruit of the Loom Platinum.

November 28, 2020 - I have purchased only Large-size Gildan T-shirts. I am very happy that the sizing has been very consistent. Gildan has much better quality control than Fruit of the Loom.

March 11, 2021 - I have revised the rating to a five stars. The T-shirts have gotten soft after probably 10 - 12 washings. The necks have stretched slightly but not very much. I am picky about that so I may notice that more than most people would. I dry the T-shirts by putting them in the dryer on energy saving setting for three minutes and then laying them on a bamboo drying rack. I do NOT dry them by putting them on hangers. The T-shirts still look great with no fading. I wear them frequently and enjoy the various colors.

September 16, 2021 - The T-shirts are still doing well. One note, I think that the 6.0 weight fabric is much better than the 5.3 weight fabric. I bought some 5.3 weight lime green T-shirts to try to make myself more visible when walking. The necks have sagged after four washes. They served the purpose for the summer. However, I would not buy the 5.3 ounce again. The 6.0 ounce T-shirts have maintained their shape with minimal neck sagging or crinkling.",positive

I wore shorts underneath to help avoid any flashing situations but I was still self conscious and tugging on the material most of the night.

I was going to wear a tank underneath too but the V-neck didn’t allow for it. It seemed to wash OK, but don’t know what it will be like when it dries (I am using a drying rack to air dry the dress).

I planned on wearing it as part of an elf costume for Ren Fen and was going to use a PU leather corset, elf ears and tall boots to complete the look. The price is great, had tons of good reviews so I ordered it. I mean, it's a super cute dress on it's own and I would totally wear this to go out for lunch with friends or to any casual event, not just Ren Fen.

Based on the Amazon suggested size for me I ordered a large (I'm in between a C cup and a D cup in bra size). It arrived quickly (my PU leather corset did not, sadly) and looked perfect. Well made, tight seems, great length. I ended up wearing it without my corset but the only thing that I had an issue with was the chest size. It was, still is a bit tight the chest. Tight enough that it's obvious that it does not fit and so for that reason it's been put in the costume bin and not a dress I would wear throughout the year. The arms fit great, the length was perfect - just above the knee - not too short, not too long.

I still like the dress and end up wearing it with a super tight sports bra and an infinity scarf to hide the tight chest. I suggest ordering a size up if you have above average size breasts (I'm in between a C and D cup bra size).",positive

The medium cube I fit about I would say 15 shirts(variation of tank tops, crop tops, and oversized shirts). This was only a one week vacation and everything remained organized throughout my trip. Dirty clothes I kept in a hamper and then once washed they were shoved back into the respective cube. I didn't take the laundry bag cause it's pretty small.

But for me, truly, I loved how much I was able to fit but keep my luggage from exploding clothes everywhere. I also love that they have handles and mesh tops to see through. We never spent more than a few days in each location, but I appreciate unpacking my suitcase wherever I go. Since my cubes were organized mostly by item types, it was easy to unpack by simply removing my cube and popping the whole cube into a shelf or a drawer. Also, I fit 3 pairs of shoes in the shoe bag. 2 pairs of flatter-ish shoes (Rothys sneakers and platform sandals) in the main compartment and a pair of flip flops in the mesh lid pocket.

They are exactly like my Lululemon leggings but much cheaper. The compression is just enough that they stay put but don't kill my hips. They are squat proof and sweat proof. They're comfortable as heck. And did I mention they're cheaper?!??! I bought 2 different pairs off Amazon to try as I didn't want to keep paying such high prices.

I prefer a more classic look for every day. However two life events took place that made me change my mind. The first was a 17-pound Pandemic weight gain. If I had a dollar for every bag of tortilla chips I consumed during the last six months, I would be able to afford to move back to NYC! And not have to work! The second event was cataract surgery ( and yes-when you get old it’ll happen to you!). Forgetting about the impact this pandemic has in connection on healthcare, I recently had the first of two cataract surgeries. Dopey me. I wore a little black dress thinking I would have to change in a hospital gown. Instead, I had to wear my lbd during surgery! Not wanting to expose my gorgeous panties or worse, a blanket was placed over me.
Needless to say my thoughts were “NFW am I wearing a dress to my next surgery”. And so, I let my fingers do the walking over to Amazon! And I found these leggings/ pants/ activewear thingies. Oh am I thrilled with them!
Regardless of my expanding hips, thighs and gut, I went with the Medium. At 5’6” and 157 lbs, the fit is fabulous! My gut is sucked in and the high waist is super Post-menopause friendly! I’ll admit, these could be a tad longer in the leg but it isn’t a deal-breaker!
The fabric is thick and opaque so you can keep transparency for your personality rather than what you’re wearing!
And these have pockets!! Holy Cannoli! Pockets! When I go back for my second cataract surgery, I can slide my insurance cards and IDin one pocket and my cell phone in the other! This is epic as purses aren’t allowed at the surgical center! Who knew that this activewear would come in handy as surgical attire? And I can work out too! Well, I’m lazy so let’s just say I can walk my dog in these pants!
The price is right, the fit is flattering and fabulous Nd I need another pair! These are great! I’m very pleased!

BUT, when you have the leggings on, you don't have that feeling - I know, weird, but they're extremely comfy. They're good for working out and have a tight fit that most workout leggings do, so if you want a looser lounge-like fit, I would suggest sizing up or maybe choosing a different pair of leggings.

I wear them almost every day and spend several hours a day 5-6 days a week at the gym running classes. I go without shoes 80% of the time. I do a lot of the workouts along side the class and these socks do not slip on the foam grappling mats. In 1 year I have worn these socks a 1,000+ times and they never got holes. My gym has concrete, foam grappling mats, and rubber mats. I throw round house kicks, hit bags, hold Thai pads/mitts, and run all over the place on a regular basis. After more than a year, I have had only one pair get a small hole in them and that was only 3 weeks ago. My feet do not slip while planking but still have easy movement when trying to work. I almost never do reviews on products but the team asked me to tell them what brand these socks were so they could also order when I got more. I placed an order again a few weeks ago and sent my team the info. We talk about these socks - because of you get it - you get it! All around they are my favorite sock even outside the gym. They fit well, are soft, and have remained snug even after a year. I honestly only ordered again because after a year I want more than 8 pairs so I don’t have to wear the lower quality socks anymore.

Pros: it has this gel thing inside the sock for grip, fairly comfortable and fits as expected. Id say it’s “no show”, got these because I needed socks to wear with my loafers that wouldn’t show the top of the sock so this does the job. And of course it’s quite cheap for 4 pairs.

These not only came packaged beautifully (I plan to leave them in the box and just put the whole box in my sock drawer as an organizer unit for them) but they are nice and soft and a great thickness. Not too thin but not bulky so you don't feel squished in your shoes. They have rubber grips on the inside of the heels to keep them from sliding off and they work great. I also like that you can't actually feel the grips while wearing the socks so it isn't uncomfortable.

I do have freakishly small feet for my height- on the narrow side and size ~7.5 (this is NOT a plus- your feet are what support your whole body) and I do NOT like socks that don’t fit snuggly. Not tight like your toes are smooshed, but snuggly. I love toe socks and I guess you could say I’m a sock snob…but I’d say I’m just particular/anal haha. So with all this you see my standards.

In the words of William Shakespeare himself, ""Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all,""

However, there is no need to accuse this fine product of neglection for it is guilty of but one crime, perfection.

We begin our story in the horrid year of 1999. While friends and family eagerly awaited the forthcoming ""Y2K"", I had a different task on my hands. I had recently purchased the Motorola Dynatac 8000M and felt all the more in tune with the latest technology for the time. Using my new-found love for the latest ""tech"" I frantically searched the then-novel ""world wide web"" via numerous internet cafes for a very specific product. Cheap, high-quality, plain white t-shirts in large quantities. At this time, the online marketplace was far from a developed industry. It lacked the required knowledge and outreach to accumulate a large enough volume of users and suppliers. As cafes were closing down, so was my hope for acquiring my desired good. ""Who would hoard such an item?"" I asked myself, ""what is the motivation to keep this product so far from my grasp?"", ""what kind of person was capable of displaying such malevolence in causing such chronic adversity?"". The difficulty in obtaining this simple item was immensely discouraging. I could not console myself, nor could others. I had found the swift and terrible end of my trails... or so I had thought. This was only the beginning.

The year is 2020, ""soaping"" (a practice in which the wearer of Soap brand shoes slides on hard objects, similar to aggressive inline skating) is all the rage, and Jif brand peanut butter is the leading name in cutting edge, ground-breaking advancements in peanut butter and jar technology. The future. These days, my old, t-shirt searching days are behind me. Internet cafes have died out due to the general public's lack of interest in the web. However, after upgrading to the 8000X, I felt the rush of a new purchase surging through my 1/10th Sephardi Jew blood. This was a rush I had not felt in a while and it brought back unresolved turmoil. My shirts. A friend of mine had recently told me about Amazon, an online bookstore that occasionally offered additional miscellaneous products for sale and I entertained the idea of continuing to search for my desired product. Upon further inspection, I found that this corporation, Amazon, was secretly in the slavery industry. They publicly advertised a container in which the owner would shout out the name of the slave trapped within (in the example, the slave was named ""Alexa"") and subsequently bark their often simple and trivial commands. Tackling this criminal organization would be an entirely separate but important task. After recovering from my horror, I got back to work. I am a man of great intelligence and finesse, this is why it took me only three days to plug in (and figure out how to operate) my QWERTY keyboard. Now I could search. My exact search was as follows: ""heterosexual slender male looking for simple white garments for my torso"". This search yielded my exact intended results, white t-shirts. The sheer quantity of the results was vast and never-ending. What was this abyss of men's casual wear I had found myself entrenched within? After sifting through all 5636 search results, I had found my holy grail, Hanes Men's 3-Pack Crew Neck T-Shirts in white.

Upon receiving my long-awaited delivery, I felt as though I was Thanos, acquiring the final gem required to bring back the dust people (I didn't watch the whole movie, just the snap part with Thanos and his best friends). I felt the crippling power surge within my skin, at this point, I had evolved into a living God of seemingly infinite quantities of Hanes Men's 3-Pack Crew Neck T-Shirts in white. I had spent my life savings on these treasures believing they would soon become the next gold. Upon removing the delicate clear plastic wrapping (a trivial task for a strong individual like myself) I found myself in a state of euphoria. The quality was that which Rhea, the God of comfort, had dreamt of. True impenetrable beauty in every line of cotton. The value of this product cannot be overstated. The fit was immensely divine and I would recommend this product to the vast majority of the population that is capable of wearing shirts.",positive

I bought them for work as I'm on my feet for 9-10 hours a day Monday thru Friday and 5-6 hours on Saturdays. I needed something comfortable, light weight and durable that I could just slip on and off. My niece suggested these but I was a tad skeptical. They looked nice, had good reviews but I just wasn't sure they would stand up to the long hours I spent on my feet. She convinced me to try a pair by bribing me with a batch of homemade snickerdoodle, lol. I fell in love with the shoes after the first week! I wear a size 9-9.5 depending on the brand. I decided to go against the majority and not round up to a 10 but try the size 9. Length wise they fit perfect. The width did give a challenge. I'm a medium to slightly over medium in width and my feet wiggled and moved around in the shoe along with the heel slipping. I bought an arch support insole and put in the shoes after wearing them for 2 days and that took care of the wiggling and near to nothing arch support in the shoes. The soles of the shoes are showing some wear but nothing like you'd expect. The tops still look great. The sides are holding up great with no signs of stress, fraying or holes. There is no sign of the sole trying to separate from the top of the shoes. However, the greatest part is I spent a fraction of the money on my Hey Dudes ( less than $55) then I would normally spend on work shoes (average spent per pair, over $100) and my Hey Dudes are holding up and showing significantly less wear and tear. I normally have to replace my work shoes every 2 years but not this time as my Hey Dudes are still going strong.",positive

The pattern on the inside feels so good on the bottom of your feet. Also - imagine just hosing off your kids’ shoes every time they get dirty. These babies last FOREVER. I’ve made a point to always buy the next size up in black only. It matches everything and is gender neutral. I have 4 kiddos and just about every size they need up to my 8yr old son so far. As they outgrow I save them for the next. So technically I’m only buying new for my 8yr old as he grows. Even my 2yr old daughter wears them! If I want I let them pick out a shoe charm for just a couple bucks to make it their own. This incredible idea has saved my family so much money and even the ones that have been through 3 of my 4 kids so far are STILL in such great shape!

Super easy to clean and even though I found the right size for me, I do wish they had half sizes as some like me, would love to have a bit of a teeny space between the two heels.

380,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Cushionaire Women's Feather recovery slide sandals with +Comfort,$24.48 - $49.99,4,"All those other reviews talking about how comfortable these shoes are are not an exaggeration! OH MY! I’ve worn Croc sliders for house shoes for over a year now, and these are so much better! I didn’t have high expectations, assuming many of the reviews I had read were exaggerated, but when I put them on, I was amazed!

The one “problem” with them is how tight they are after a while. Sliding them on was a bit difficult, but once on, they become uncomfortable at the top of the foot. I even started getting a blister! I had read a few reviews talking about this and thought that those people must have wide feet. NOPE. I have narrow feet, and they squeezed my feet so tight and left marks. I read one review that talked about heating them up with a blow dryer, so I tried that. I put on thick socks, warmed one up for 3 minutes while stretching it with my hands and put it on. I then did the other. I wore them with the thick socks for around 30 minutes and took the socks off and VOILA! They stretched and no longer squeeze my feet! So 4 stars because someone shouldn’t have to stretch their shoes like that, especially it you have narrow feet.

As far as sizing goes, I wear a size womens 10 in everything! I sized up to an 11/12 in blush, and they barely fit. I’d have to say that they definitely run small.

Aside from them running small (just size up) and needing to stretch them, they are great. I totally recommend them.",positive

They are some of the most sturdy, light, and comfortable shoes that I have ever worn.

I have no complaints, up until recently and I'm only writing this to help out others so it won't happen to you!
I went on my parent's boat this past weekend and I must have left one of them out, not under a seat in the shade. At the end of the day, I went to put them back on to go home - IT HAD SHRUNK! They have always fit my feet perfectly, but after this one day in the sun my right shoe hasn't been the same :( It shrunk at least half a size, so now my heel slips out the back and the over-the-foot part is way too tight.

THE POINT OF THIS REVIEW - absolutely buy these shoes, but don't leave these babies in the sun, or be weary leaving them out in the sun for loooong periods of time! A few hours at the pool has been just fine but a whole day? Be careful :)

I'll be buying another pair for myself so they actually fit me again!",positive

She ordered them in beige.. beige- boring- she says neutral… Hers arrived and we wear the same size shoe, so of course I tried the BEIGE on-super squishy!!! I liked the fit but not the color, so I ordered my own and I finally decided on bright blue. It sure is bright but I’m not a fan of beige. They are squishy and comfy slides and trendy. After a few days of wearing, I noticed my pinky toe was a little sore from rubbing, but no blister and I had worn them a lot. They fit well to size and clean up easily from sand.

I purchased the Tan/Beige color & White color sandals.

I also bought them in the 7/8 size, which is also a good fit but almost too small 😂 but again … still totally wearable. Either way, I’m happy with my purchase.

They’re super lightweight, very cushy to wear and have a nice “finish or pattern” on them, that elevate it to a quality-looking slip on.

I would still recommend the name brand Cloud Slides or Pillow Slides for unmatched comfort, but these are pretty dang close. The yellow is super vibrant in person. I wear a size 8-8.5 typically, and based on reviews, I decided to order an 8 in these slides also.

ONLY con is that if you leave them in the sun or a hot car they SHRINK and become unwearable!! This is a warning so you don’t make the same mistake I did :) but I would rather die than not have these sandals so no matter how many pairs shrink I will always buy another pair.",positive

This time I got the whiteboard. This is slightly softer and has more stretch than the ojai shorts. I think it’s maybe an inch to half an inch longer which I don’t mind. The white isn’t see thru and it’s also not paper white, it’s more cream /white. (Again that’s what I wanted) I loved these shorts because I’m a mom now and want to wear shorts that are not always booty shorts , and these were a good transition lol it’s also very flattering, it really accentuates the backside, if you do or don’t have it . for reference I’m 5’1 126 lbs, got size 26 in both shorts.",positive
391,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Levi's Women's 501 Original Shorts,$20.49 - $59.50,5,"They fit and feel like all my other Levi’s. They’re TTS and just long enough to be decent. I’m a diehard when it comes to 501s and they are consistent with the fit. I know there are some concerns of them being knock offs due to the red tag, but if you go to the Levi’s website they’ll explain why. In a nutshell, 1/10 of their items have intentional blank tabs to signify they own the rights to the actual red tag and placement. So don’t worry, they’re good! Plus, as long as you look and feel good in them, what’s the problem?

For reference, I’m 5’5” 115lbs and ordered a 25 in sansome straggler and Luxor baked. Both are fitted, but not tight and wear nicely with room for comfort. But this is all preference on how I like them to fit and if I wanted a more skin tight fit, sizing down would have worked (:",positive

The color is staying after 4 washes and the rips are not ripping more. The only thing that is strange is the water and button closures, the buttons have a tendency to pooch out for no reason, and the back pooches out quite a bit. I was able to drink them some but it isn’t helping with the buttons. I might die down in my next pair and see it helps. I’m typically a 4 or 6 in women’s (pear shape) and I thought the 28 fit big",positive
393,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Levi's Women's 501 Original Shorts,$20.49 - $59.50,5,This is my second pair of the 501’s and they’re by far my favorite shorts. In the pictures they have been worn and then washed and dried. My first pair was the true blue Jean shorts I purchased from Macy’s size 29. I sized up in those because they had absolutely no stretch to them. I purchased the grey wash thru Amazon thinking it would be the same but this wash does have some stretch to them for sure. I would’ve sized down but i didn’t want them to be too tight because then the stretch makes high waisted shorts cut me right at the hips and it’s not cute or comfortable. And they’re not too big to the point of it being noticeable. I love how these fit and how they look and will definitely be purchasing more. I have tried on the dark black 501’s at the Levi’s store and those have no stretch as well so sizing varies on the wash for sure!,positive

I ordered my true waist size (28) - I'm about 142lb and 39 hips also for reference. I loved the higher rise on them but they did seem really short. After one day of wear, the front rips completely broke and now the shorts look incredibly short in the front. The back still looks nice.

410,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Tronjori Women High Waist Casual Wide Leg Long Palazzo Pants Trousers Regular Size,$23.79 - $39.99,4,"I read through all the reviews and was stuck between ordering XS and SM. I went with XS bc I read a review that says there is a give bc of the elastic in the back and that was a mistake. It was too small. There is no give at all. The elastic is more for the aesthetic. Technically it could have worked bc it ""looked fine"" but it felt too tight for me and was squeezing my fat to spill over. If you enjoy that feeling of constriction, then XS can work for you. I ordered SM after and it fits perfectly. I wear them high waisted and it's still pretty long but was able to wear it with tory burch flip flops without it touching the floor.

Quality is eh but it IS about $35 bucks for trouser style. Pretty heavy despite the thinness. You have to wear a thong or no show, bc your panty definitely shows through. And the clasp to close your pants is sown in an area where it pulls weird and is slightly unflattering.

Only concern now is how they will look after they are washed and dried... Afraid it will be super wrinkly and hard to straighten out. But as for now, I think it's worth it for $35 bucks. Better than spending $250 for decent trousers that you can only dry clean.

Hope my review helped!",positive
411,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Tronjori Women High Waist Casual Wide Leg Long Palazzo Pants Trousers Regular Size,$23.79 - $39.99,4,"I really love these but I do think they're a little pricy. The material is very nice and not really what I expected being 'Amazon pants'. They are VERY wide leg so keep that in mind, they're not just loose, but they're so loose and wide they hardly touch my thighs when I wear them. I'm 193lb, 5ft5 and relatively curvy, and an XL fit me perfectly. I probably could have gone with L but I'm happy with them. I got the shorter length because I didn't want them to drag the floor, and with heels, they hit my ankles. Without, they touch my heels but don't drag too bad. They are SO comfortable and fun! Definitely recommend if you can look past the price, these are something specific I was looking for so I felt it was worth it.",positive
412,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Tronjori Women High Waist Casual Wide Leg Long Palazzo Pants Trousers Regular Size,$23.79 - $39.99,4,"These are flowy and look nice. I got a medium, and they fit well (I'm 5'2"", 130 lbs, and carry my weight in my midsection and thighs). I got the regular length and will have to wear a small heel so I don't trip over them. The fabric is kind of awful, but I only removed one star for that because I have a pair from Abercrombie the fabric is just as bad but in a different way (both are very polyester, but the Abercrombie pants are a rough fabric and these are very smooth) and cost twice as much. So in terms of what's popular and what everyone is wearing, I think these are a solid choice. I'm keeping them and plan to wear them but only to work and not to anything nicer than that (I work in a school).",positive
413,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Tronjori Women High Waist Casual Wide Leg Long Palazzo Pants Trousers Regular Size,$23.79 - $39.99,5,"These pants are AMAZING. I bought them for work or casual outfit. The wrinkles come out easy with a spritz of water, they are very light weight and flowy, has an elastic waiste in the back, so no gapping.....perfect for all of the Houston seasons. I aired on the side of caution with the first pair and bought an XL because I'm 5'8"", 165lbs, and very pear shaped (wide hips, booty, and athletic legs). The XL was a little big in my waist, but still comfortable and doesn't look like the pants were wearing me. The large though fits perfect. There is a difference in length between the L and XL by an inch and half. I have a 32"" inch inseam and the XL a little long, but I still wore them with flats and wasn't stepping on them. The large falls right about an inch from the bottom of my heel. 100% will get a few more pairs. I get compliments everytime I wear them. Well worth the money.",positive
414,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Tronjori Women High Waist Casual Wide Leg Long Palazzo Pants Trousers Regular Size,$23.79 - $39.99,4,"I agree with others to focus on your waist measurement - these are true wide leg pants. They're extremely flattering and comfy - my waist is 30"" and my hips are 42"" but I opted for the L because I typically don't trust anything that says I can wear M bottoms. They're a smidge loose at the waist but the elastic keeps them in place and I like the extra room. They're a little longer than I would have liked - they hit the floor for me and I'm 5'6"". Also, the material is polyester and it does show - if they were a cotton blend it would be 5 stars from me.",positive

Normally I struggle with pants being too tight on my thighs/butt and too loose on my waist. I got a size L and I have a little bit of extra room in my waist but the leg part fits great. I got a light pink and had no problem with sheerness. I was worried they would be very wrinkle prone because of the material but they didn't wrinkle at all! My only complaint is I wish the bottom leg part was a little more tappered. They are pretty long, I'm 5'7 and I have to wear heels with them because they hit right at my heel.

I got a medium and they’re a little too big but I worry that a small would be too small and tight for me.

These XS pants will fit perfectly with a heel! I prefer a snug fit around the waist so I am going to tighten the elastic back a bit. I have a smaller waist (00) so this is not uncommon for me. The elastic waste will accommodate many ways sizes. They have a bit of that polyester sheen to them but I think they are still appropriate for daytime wear and can definitely be worn as a dress pant.,positive
418,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Tronjori Women High Waist Casual Wide Leg Long Palazzo Pants Trousers Regular Size,$23.79 - $39.99,5,"the absolute only reason im giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is the waist is a little tight on me. I usually run in between a large and an extra large, so I tried a large first - and I will absolutely be getting more colors (in XL, of course). These pants are so, so comfortable, even with the bit of tightness in the waist, and the fabric is extremely soft and doesn't feel cheap at all.

If you run in between sizes like me, get the larger size. but ABSOLUTELY get these pants!!",positive
419,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Tronjori Women High Waist Casual Wide Leg Long Palazzo Pants Trousers Regular Size,$23.79 - $39.99,4,"I didn’t know what to expect with these pants but I’m pleased with them. I generally wear a 6-8 in pants but am 5’4 with short legs so I was worried about the length more than the waistband. To my surprise the medium not only fit perfectly, they are a cropped length so I could wear them with platforms or cute heels that I wanted to show off. If you want to wear them with heels but not see the heels, you may have a problem, unless you’re really short. The two cons are 1) you definitely need an iron or steamer on these if you want them to look put-together for work. Wrinkled they look sloppy, ironed they look classy. And 2) the seam in the back is TERRIBLY placed. It runs exactly where your crack is and makes it look like you have a wedgie. I think this is more pronounced with the light colors. Not a dealbreaker and I do plan to order another color or two.",positive
420,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Under Armour Men's Sportstyle Left Chest Short Sleeve T-shirt,$9.20 - $80.00,4,"The shirt is made of thin material. If you scrape against something sharp, it will tear easy. In addition, the fabric does not on much sweat/water before its noticeably drenched and uncomfortable. Finally, the overall shape of the shirt doesn't frame an athletic figure very well; its like straight jeans: the top is the same thickness as the bottom so if you have a broad chest and thinner waist, the bottom half of the shirt flows like a skirt. I think it would fit portly gentlemen better. HUK clothing tends to frame better between chest and waist. Other than that, it is a cool, fairly comfy shirt that is perfectly acceptable for standard outdoor activities.",positive

It really is a great shirt. Its thin but that means it’s breathable. It stays cool and Is super comfortable in hot conditions. I’ve bought several. If you’re looking for the tight stretchy shirts then this isn’t for you either. This is more like your grandfathers old undershirts.

These are great comfort t shirts and of nice quality. BUT I do not wear these for working out and I don't even really like them when it's above 90 degrees. I would describe this as a great t shirt to wear with jeans. I also like that you can't really see the UA logo on the blue shirt and some of the other colors..

460,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Amazon Essentials Women's Belice Ballet Flat,$7.60 - $21.80,4,"Since I stand 5'10"", my feet have been an issue most of my life for being on the big side. As my dad used to say, ""you need a good foundation"" lol I'm getting these flats in a few colors because I finally found my sizing - I had to go a 1/2 or whole size up. Because I recently lost a lot of weight, I don't know my current shoe size but all my own shoes are loose now. I figured I could go down a tad in these, but nope.

Look, they're $20 shoes, so I'm not going to get lathered up about some wrinkles in the pleather. If you loved the flats from Payless, yes, these are very similar. As expected, no arch support. The toebox is not high, so if your toes curl up, you'll be scraping the inner tops. Mine don't curl up but I can see my big toe nail pressing it a little.

These are great for filling in the colors I couldn't snag from Payless before they closed. I don't think they'll take a huge beating, but for shopping and such, they'll be fine. Mine were comfy right out of the bag.

Take note if you're looking at the dark brown - it is *really* dark, and my pair is getting sent back for the dark camel instead. The fake leather is a little unconvincing, while the microfiber/fake suede ones look exceptionally good.

I see Amazon has many sizes and colors coming up ""We don't know if or when this will be back"" - Amazon, this is a great staple, please keep them coming.",positive

I love Amazon for having the guts to stock bigger womens sized shoes!!! Thank you Amazon!! Otherwise I might just always be barefoot. Over the years due to the tearing of all the ligaments in both of my ankles I have a very big problem with swelling in my feet. I have tried other flats but most of the shoes I like are very expensive. I know it’s never good to skimp on quality footwear and for most of my life I did buy good, expensive shoes. But now being older and really only using my shoes for shorter periods of time I didn’t want to spend a small fortune considering my finances can only be pulled in so many directions. I checked on many reasonably priced shoes but it seemed every pair I liked were sold out of my size! I just happened to luck out and find these. I was looking thru boots and there these were!! Kind of like a “You might like these….”. Black. My size. Faux leather. Flats. And $19.50? What did I have to lose? Amazon is great about returns so I ordered them. Tried the left on first because that is the foot that REALLY swells and it was comfortable. Stood up. Walked. We have a winner. The faux leather looks, and feels, like real leather. Great cushioning and great support. These might just be a pair of inexpensive flat shoes but to me they are indicative of why I order most of my stuff from Amazon. Great value, great quality, fast delivery and great customer service. For $19.50 I am trying to figure out what color I want to order next!!",positive

The black pair will be worn at my granddaughters wedding reception for comfort over the heals I will be wearing for the wedding, they are that pretty. I usually wear a 7.5 and that is what I originally ordered but I had to return them as they were too short. I then ordered a size 8 and they are perfect and do not crowd the toe or slip off the heal. All 5 colors I have received fit the same. Sometimes different colors fit differently, I don’t know why, but these are all uniform in size.",positive
463,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry",Amazon Essentials Women's Belice Ballet Flat,$7.60 - $21.80,4,"Nice average ballet flat if you size up one half of a size. I do like the fact that the sole is less prone to slipping or sliding on a wet floor than others I've worn. Heel fits well and doesn't rub. Wish it had more cushion on the footbed, as that would make it much more comfortable (a 5 star rating). If I'd known the need for an insole to augment the cushioning, I would have sized up an additional half size (one whole size total) and added my own insoles. These are not a great outdoor shoe-the manmade uppers are fairly thin and do not give much supportive structure to the shoe, itself, so if you are walking over rough, uneven surfaces, you may want to look at a different shoe. However, if you just want a shoe for around the house, this is a nice shoe at a nice price.",positive

490,"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry","Hanes Men's Hoodie, EcoSmart Fleece Zip-Front Hooded Sweatshirt, Cotton-Blend Fleece Hooded Sweatshirt, Mid-Weight Zip-Up",$13.99 - $44.49,5,"My Quick Review: Overall, I highly suggest buying the sweatshirt. If you require a sweatshirt and are not willing to pay $40, $60, or $100 for one at another source, then this one would be your solution. If you decide to purchase this one, you will not be unhappy or dissatisfied. The quality is exceptional at a cost that is a fraction of the price as the same thing from a name-brand source.

My Extensive Review: If you are a content creator, it’s in your best interests to wear none branded clothing when appearing within the content you create. This unbranded sweatshirt is perfect for this.

The sweatshirt arrived in a strong Amazon box and not a soft plastic bag. When I opened the Amazon box, the sweatshirt was nicely sealed in a plastic bag. The bag also displayed the details of the sweatshirt, such as size and color, and this matched precisely what I ordered.

I unpackaged the sweatshirt and laid it out to inspect for any defects or problems that may have occurred from the manufacturer, but also to get a full view of the overall quality of the sweatshirt. I found no flaws or issues. The drawstrings that go around your neck were in place, the zipper worked perfectly, and the pockets were appropriately positioned. I then checked the size on the tag attached to the sweatshirt, and it matched the label that was on the bag and also what I had ordered.

When I put the sweatshirt on, it felt the same as any other sweatshirt costing upwards of $100 from a name-brand source.

During my initial inspection, I did notice two things.

The first was the drawstrings that tighten the hood's opening and go around your neck are relatively short. I prefer this, but since they were so short, the first thing I did before trying it on was to tie a large double knot at each end of the drawstring to prevent the strings from going up into the little chrome loop. If I hadn’t done this, I am very sure the drawstring would have been lost by working themselves back up into the little chromed loophole located by your neck.

I noticed that this sweatshirt is slightly thinner than sweatshirts from Walmart, Costco, or a name-brand outlet. However, even though lighter, this works out rather lovely because it makes the sweatshirt feel less restrictive and more comfortable to wear, and much easier to put on and take off. Since purchasing this sweatshirt, I have worn it outside in the cold of winter (-0 and below) for quick runs out of the car, and it has kept me just as warm as any other sweatshirt would.

Overall I recommend getting the sweatshirts if you need one and not paying $40, $60, or $100 from other sources.",positive
