0,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",TERRO T2502 Ready-to-Use Indoor Fruit Fly Trap with Built in Window,$5.89 - $66.37,4,"we had a bit of a fruit fly problem, so we got some zap traps that looked like they would work for $20~30 and a pair of these. the zap traps did not catch ONE fly, not fruit flies or any other kind of flying bug. maybe we got crappy zap traps, but the apples (and specifically these, not the raid apples, which kinda work but not as well) have been amazing.

here's how it's gonna go - you only order these when you're frustrated that you can't get rid of the flies, so you'll fill the trap, and then you get frustrated when you see flies land on the trap and crawl in and out of the holes and not fly into the solution. but after just an hour, we had a clump of flies in the solution, and after a day, a large number of them. we can't figure out where they're coming from and this is the most important thing you can do to fix your fruit fly problem, but in the meantime this has made our situation more bearable.

also, there are a few reviews complaining that you have to order more traps because they don't open. they do. it's just not intuitive to open them, but if you squeeze them at the seam you can get them open to clean the flies out (do this outside!) and if you wanted to add your own fluid you could.",positive
1,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",TERRO T2502 Ready-to-Use Indoor Fruit Fly Trap with Built in Window,$5.89 - $66.37,3,"This product does not trap the flies whatsoever. The holes on the top are far too large and the flies can just buzz right out whenever they want. The only flies it actually kills are the ones who drown themselves! As a lure, the chemical (smells like mostly apple cider vinegar) works very well, so here's a breakdown of what you should do:

Step 1: Recon
-Examine the areas the flies congregate in. Generally this will be places like a produce basket, an under-the-microwave light, the garbage, a compost bucket, and the sink or other moist places.

Step 2: Address the congregation areas
-The flies are searching for food and water, especially anything sugary.

-If they are attacking your produce, determine if there's any old or broken produce and dispose of it. Place other produce in the refrigerator or inside enclosed (tupperware) containers. Clean the normal produce container inside and out, preferably with a dishwasher or soak in hot water. Clean the areas near it as well. Don't forget the onions and potatoes you might keep in a different spot! The oven is a great place to store things if you don't have alot of containers, but be careful that you don't bring the flies with you.
-If they are hanging out by the garbage, empty your garbage/recycling more frequently and clean the receptacles.
-If they are in the sink, try to wash the dishes immediately after use instead of leaving them for later.
-If they are in your dishwasher, try the above and hand wash for a week instead or run the dishwasher more frequently instead of letting dirty dishes sit.
- If you compost, leave the bucket outdoors for a while or stop composting while you deal with the infestation.

You get the idea.

Step 3: Lure and Kill
- If you bought these lures, place them in the biggest offending areas in a prominent place, preferably close to lighting (leave the lights on if you can). You will see the little devils sit right on top or slightly inside the lures. They may also hang out nearby. Now is your time to strike!
-Grab a bottle of windex and make sure it sprays a nice mist instead of a jet. Your best bet is to attack while they are grounded, but often the mist will weight their wings down and they will fall to the closest surface. It may take a second squirt but they will die rapidly in a pool of windex.
-Don't go crazy trying to get every single fly as they will settle down and congregate again in a little while.
-Be prepared to spray the windex whenever you approach the offending areas. If you're about to open the dishwasher, rip it open and spray right away! Same for garbage or the fridge.

This is a fool-proof way to commit fruit-fly genocide. They are going after essentially dirt and grime so get cleaning! Now is not the time to be eco-conscious and save that bruised apple. Use it, eat it, compost it, throw it away!

If you follow this guide your infestation should be under control within 72 hours and nearly/completely gone within a week. Be careful not to reoffend by going exactly back to old habits though!

Good luck!",fair
2,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",TERRO T2502 Ready-to-Use Indoor Fruit Fly Trap with Built in Window,$5.89 - $66.37,4,"I live in Texas and had a persistent fruit fly problem after buying a bad batch of strawberries.

I placed the “apples” near their hang out spots where they wouldn’t be disturbed, then added the lure. It was astonishing - flys started swarming over IMMEDIATELY. After 24-48 hours, my problem was solved.

It’s hard to look inside, but there are easily a couple dozen flys in each, and I haven’t seen one since! I was concerned the flies would have trouble finding their way inside and actually get trapped, but it worked out.

I tried pairing it with those flat, yellow, sticky fly catcher’s but those worked horribly. Dry enough that only one that landed on it got caught.

I’d give this 5 stars if it was reusable and they sold the lure, but apparently they don’t. Not eco friendly and I’ll see if I can find a way to do so.",positive
3,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",TERRO T2502 Ready-to-Use Indoor Fruit Fly Trap with Built in Window,$5.89 - $66.37,4,"This is a great product that works really well…however it consistently has been running out of liquid well before the 45 days they advertised. I bought and deployed several of these on Aug. 11 and half have dried up and the others are tracking to be dried up soon (only 14 days after purchase). To make it a little more annoying (and as several other reviewers have already mentioned), the company doesn’t sell the liquid alone “due to sanitary reasons”. The little apples are designed so well and even allows for the top to be removed easily, so it’s seems so wasteful to continue buying more and more of these plastic apples that I don’t need just to get more liquid. The liquid works so well, I’d happily buy it at the same cost for environmental reasons alone. So far, we have 12 of these little apples and are needing more liquid again, so searching for alternative solutions to avoid adding to our stock pile…",positive
4,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",TERRO T2502 Ready-to-Use Indoor Fruit Fly Trap with Built in Window,$5.89 - $66.37,4,"These suckers are really good for use. No DIY-mess that comes with making your own with a cup and saran wrap/rubber band and and toothpicks, no fuss, no clean-up... except two out of two times we've ordered them, the ""bait"" they said to use has failed to lure in any bugs.

Both times I just topped it off myself (first time with a few drips from a strawberry daiquiri wine cooler, second time with a few drops of white wine vinegar) and suddenly there were gobs and gobs of the nasty little bugs inside. Buying it from Amazon is a lot cheaper than any of the local options, but my assumption is the ones I got *may* have been a bit too old for the bait to still catch anything. Still, a few drops of home-chosen bait will (at least for me!) fix that issue.",positive
5,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",TERRO T2502 Ready-to-Use Indoor Fruit Fly Trap with Built in Window,$5.89 - $66.37,5,"I buy this every summer for fruit flies and it works great. I am not a fan of the smell, but that is probably unavoidable as I tend to be very sensitive about all odors. This is asking me to rate the ""adhesion"" but I don't know what adhesion they are referring to. You just squirt the bait into the little apple trap and then put the trap wherever you think the flies are breeding, like near the fruit or the sink. Within a couple of days, all the flies are gone! Hooray! The only downside is that if you need to bait the traps again later, you have to buy more bait and that costs more than buying the initial bait & traps. But it's not that big of a deal. Also, this only works for fruit flies. If you have house flies, pantry moths, or anything else, you have to treat for that insect. There isn't a product that gets rid of all insects and lets people survive.",positive
6,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",TERRO T2502 Ready-to-Use Indoor Fruit Fly Trap with Built in Window,$5.89 - $66.37,4,"Let’s get the good out of the way.

It works, it works fast, and puts a bug zapper to shame in efficiency.
So I’ll say this - if you’ve got a fruit fly problem, this is an EXCELLENT product for getting rid of them.

And for the bad. The refills.
Or really I should say, the non-existent refills.
These are plastic apples, with two plastic windows inside of them, that come with a little bottle of vinegar smelling liquid lure to add to the apples.

When I purchased these, I assumed I would use as needed, clean them out and store them to be used another day.
But nope. They don’t sell the lure. You’re supposed to just throw away these perfectly good, well designed plastic apples, and buy more of the traps so you can have more lure liquid.

I get it, it’s a cheap buy, but that’s not the point. Just a waste of plastic. I mean would you throw out a humming bird feeder once the liquid was gone?
Just seems silly and annoying.

But there it is. It will work incredibly well, but unless you want to make your own lure afterwards, you have to buy completely new traps.",positive
7,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",TERRO T2502 Ready-to-Use Indoor Fruit Fly Trap with Built in Window,$5.89 - $66.37,4,"This product works exactly as intended. However, if you live in a dry region (such as Arizona/southern Nevada/southern Utah) the bait fluid dries out far before the advertised “lasts up to 90 days” time.

The 90 days refer to 45 days for each of the two apples, using the provided lure fluid. Each of ours (southern Utah desert) dried out after 2-3 weeks. This is not the fault of the product, but it is something to take into consideration when making a purchase choice.",positive

As a work from home freelance artist, I need absolute concentration. So it goes without saying that fly's in your face are VERY distracting as well as annoying.

Set one trap in my room and one in the kitchen. Seemed to take care of them quite well over the span of a few days. Granted, they still keep coming it seems, but so long as I have this little red apple of doom, it takes care of the problem... I'd say about 85-90% effective. Give it a try!!",positive
9,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",TERRO T2502 Ready-to-Use Indoor Fruit Fly Trap with Built in Window,$5.89 - $66.37,5,"We recently moved to a new office and noticed gnats and/or fruit flies seemed to like what we've done with the place. Every day, my coworkers and I were swatting at these things. The property management was slow at sending out pest control, so I took a chance on these. I ordered 6 total units and put them all out as soon as they arrived. Within 2 hours, each apple had at least 3 gnats on it. The one in the highest problem area had 7! The next morning, each apple had several dead bugs in it and the tops were still attracting more. There was only 1 that I noticed flying around that day compared to dealing with them all day. By the second morning, they were completely gone. We have not seen any since the first 24 hours and we are now a week fly/gnat free. Highly recommend. We will use these again should the problem return.",positive
10,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",TERRO,$12.28 - $31.97,5,"I had an occasional ant or two showing up in my office and could not track down where they were coming from. Every few minutes i'd feel one crawling up my leg, I'd pick it off me, look everywhere on the floor and find no others. It's like they were coming right up through the floor or something but they never revealed their entryway to me.
Got some tarro liquid gel bait, placed against a wall under my desk, and the next day I had a line of ants coming from somewhere across the room, all the way over to that bait. Suckers! I moved the bait to their entryway and they've been all over it for about 5 days now.
I also placed bait in my bathroom where there were some ants. Put it near where they were scavenging but these ants must not be part of the same group because they ignored it for 2 days until I put it right up in their faces, then they swarmed it. These ones liked to swim in it though and clogged up the entrance to the bait. Had to scrape out the dead body clump there to make it a little more attractive to future ants who may not like the idea of climbing over a pile of their dead family to get to the food.
Looking at the bait over these past few days, it seems many ants just get stuck in the gel and ultimately die. I'm not sure how much of this is actually making it back to the nest. Activity around the bathroom bait is definitely slowing though. Lots of ants hanging around but don't seem to be doing much, almost like they're drunk. They brought in reinforcements too, some at least 2-3 times bigger than what I usually saw there, but they too are stumbling around like drunkards now. The office ants are still pretty active though...they too seem to just get stuck and die but have greater numbers.
Overall, the bait is working! Watching it work is nearly as good as watching a Netflix series.

UPDATE: It's been about 11 days or so and the office ants don't seem to be slowing down. I put 3 baits there initially, and they slowly filled up with dead ants (1 was even completely dry) so, I decided to replace those with 3 fresh baits.
The other 2 ant locations I used this bait on worked really well and only took a few days to see a slowdown and eventual end to their activity there, but these office ants are apparently sturdier and have greater numbers.
Hopefully these 3 fresh baits are enough to finish off the office ants. Again, not sure on how much of this gets back to the nest... They all just seem to get stuck and die inside the bait. Will report back on progress.

UPDATE 2: Been just over 2 weeks now and the office ants are finally slowing down. I'm gonna conclude this room took longer simply because there were a lot more of them there than the other rooms. Eventually, they'll all die but you gotta be persistent and replace the baits when they inevitably turn into graveyards full of bodies. Probably another week and this group will be done for good.",positive
11,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",TERRO,$12.28 - $31.97,5,"I very rarely write reviews which is kind of stupid because I usually read reviews prior to getting certain products. Therefore I guess I will start now, hoping I can help someone decide wether or not this product is for them. Before you read this long review I want to let you know this is the BEST product I have ever used.

Before I tell you about how AMAZING this product was I will tell you what kind of Ant 🐜 problem I had. Maybe someone can relate.
I have a parrot and he is in a room that is near a window. With all the different types of food he eats and with the warmer weather that we started having in my area (NJ) I started seeing ants outside. That’s when I started seeing some ants coming in from the bottom left corner of the frame of our window. I have never had an ant issue with the 17 years I live hear. Even having my parrot and all the amounts of food he eats. For some reason last year during the spring time is when I saw these crazy little annoying bugs come in my house.
These ants seemed to be a different type of ant. One I have never seen before. They were small but the minute you go near them they would run away or scatter away super fast. I have an exterminator on my block and he told us they were sugar ants. What the hell is a sugar ant? Lol. Well I was told that these ants hide out in your shower and in the kitchen because of the sugary foods around. Why are they found in a bathroom is beyond me. But I looked it up after what he said and everything he told us was what I read on line about “sugar ants”. I mentioned that last year I had this problem and they were found behind the faucet in our shower. That’s another story. Anyway, before having an exterminator come into my house, I figured I would try to resolve the problem myself. So before buying this “AMAZING PRODUCT”, I purchased all the “Raid” products that come in the square plastic containers. The ones that come in white or grey containers. I put the Raid traps by the window and where else I thought they might come in. I actually tried the mixture of vinegar, sugar and water concoction that was told on line to use for these ants. But nothing worked. I doubt an ant even went to these traps because near my window they would go around those traps. I was getting frustrated because I skeeve bugs. And I was afraid of an exterminator coming in with my parrot living here. I wasn’t taken that chance of him dying with the chemicals. Anyway after coming to a dead end with the Raid traps I began reading and reading on so many products just to find a worthy product. That’s when I came across this product. It was very different than the normal products that are used to kill ants. So I figured why not, let me give it a try. I received my order really fast and was anxious to use them. After reading all the directions these baits were very easy to use. It comes in a thick clear rectangular container. To open it, it Reccomended to hold it up right and twist off the plastic top until it snaps off. It was a little tough for me to snap off the top like it says on the package. Therefore I used a pair of scissors to open the trap. Word of advise, if you need a pair of scissors to open your product, just make sure to keep the trap upright so the liquid doesn’t pour out. After opening the trap, I then placed this trap about 3-4 inches away from the bottom corner of the window. Right where I saw the ants coming in. They scurried away from me at first, but the minute I put this trap down it was shocking!! No joke. I was shocked to see all these ants go running toward the opening of this trap. The trap actually attracted more ants to come out of hiding to eat this food (crazy). I actually spilt a little bit on my windowsill and some ran to that and got stuck. But what was amazing to me was after I put the trap down and watching these ants go to it, it was shocking to see them run right back out of the corner of the windowsill. It was crazy. I just watched for a few minutes and to see them either get trapped inside the trap or grab some of the food in the trap and run back outside or wherever they came from. And by the end of the day they were gone. It’s about 2 weeks now since I only used one trap and I have yet to see another NASTY ANT!! Wahooo!!!! They are gone.

This product is BY FAR THE BEST ANT PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED IN MY LIFE!! This is noooo joke. Therefore you can count on me to continue to purchase and use this product for any ant problem that might arise again. I will never buy a different type of ant trap again. No matter how popular people feel the “Raid” products might be. The sprays are only wonderful for the outdoors but for the inside the “Raid” products are definitely not as effective as this product is. I actually gave my neighbor 2 traps and after a day or two they were gone by him as well. These traps are crazy how wonderful they work. I swear by this product and I know if you purchase these traps you will too. I will never buy another kind of ant traps again. These are the BEST kind of ant traps on the market by far!!! And mind you, I AM NOT making any kind of commission from this company for this product review. I am just sooo happy my ant issue is gone for now. Sooo, if you want to get rid of these annoying, nasty bugs “FAST,” then purchase these traps. And I promise you, you will be so happy you did.",positive
12,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",TERRO,$12.28 - $31.97,5,"Ok, haven’t written a review in a while as I’m usually very descriptive and detailed but will try to keep this one simple. I can’t be 100% sure that it was this product that did it alone as we triple attacked. Allow me to explain.

We had a big birthday party for our kids and it took a while until family who stayed with us along with their kids eventually left. Bottom line the house wasn’t exactly immaculate but any standards. The little tiny black ants showed up out of nowhere and had a steady stream in and out of the house by way of what appears to be a space in the deck door jam that leads into our kitchen. They went along the base molding up the cabinets and asking the granite counter at the edge of the wall in the kitchen all the way across and over to the other side of our stove where we keep a small garbage can for our compost items. But they weren’t drawn just to that I’m sure.

Anyhow, I’ve crushed them, wiped them away, and sprayed vinegar. The later worked for maybe a day or so each time we tried.

Enough was enough so I bought this and Amdro Ant Block Home Perimeter Ant Bait, 1LB 8oz (24 Oz). Put that outside and swept it under the base of the vinyl siding and doorway around where the ants were coming in. Inside I see these traps up. Only reason for giving it one star less on of the features is that the tabs don’t easily come off and literally without my forearms every morning. Note to their QC/CS peeps, these should be perforated to make it easier for customers or tell them to cut them off.

Anyhow, I wasn’t playing song and laid out three along the counter and two in the floor from the doorway to the counter.

Bam - the triple play combo worked in a single day. I haven’t removed the traps over the past three or four days done I set them just to be sure. Love the immediate results.

Will see what happens after I remove them… as in will they come back.",positive
13,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",TERRO,$12.28 - $31.97,5,"While these are amazing, there are some inherent issues.

1. It takes time for the ants to collect the goods and head back to poison the colony. You will have a massive string of ants that you'll just need to deal with. It takes a few days.

2. If you don't pick these up after ants are gone, you will have another set of ants that come to find the poison and you'll need to repeat step 1.

3. There is still poison left and there's no way to package up or save for later. You'll need to find another spot to deploy until the liquid is gone.

4. It's liquid. It can leak. Hold it properly and carefully.

5. It's not a permanent solution. It's to fix problem areas and is not a preventative.

As far as pros go,

1. The dogs and cat don't seem to be interested.

2. You can see the results with the massive graveyard inside the liquid.

3. 12 come in a box - and you wont need that many at first (unless you have multiple problem areas (I did).

Overall I would buy again, but it's not a solution in itself to prevent ants from coming back.",positive
14,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",TERRO,$12.28 - $31.97,5,"So, I just moved into my apartment about a month ago. Living in Wyoming and all of its temperature fluxes recently I started noticing these little buggers coming out OF MY CARPET. Now, I have a fear of ants and small bugs alike, so as soon as I saw a small cluster of them, I immediately took to amazon to find something that works. In the first two pictures I uploaded, that was after roughly 4 hours after I laid two traps down. Obviously extremely shocked at the sheer amount I had just discovered compared to the small cluster I saw the morning before, I grabbed a couple more traps and readied my defenses. I now had three traps ready to battle these little shits. In the second two pictures you’ll see just what happened with having three down. EVEN MORE KEPT COMING. Those pictures were taken roughly an hour after I set the third one down, so now, roughly 5-6 hours after first setting these ants up for failure, I had lured out HUNDREDS and boy were they hungry. Upon my moms advice i did decided to vacuum up some of the stragglers so i didn’t have to keep looking at all of them crawling around (also, I thought those in the traps were dead). Right when I started that, BOOM, they all started fleeing from my vacuum suction. The ants in the traps were ALIVE. So , obviously freaked out by this even more and after vacuuming up probably 200 ants, I left some stragglers so they had the chance to go back and poison their queen. I then laid two more traps and essentially created an arch of traps to keep them consolidated to one place (they are on the edge of my kitchen and i don’t want them spreading). So now, 5 traps down and 7 hours later, the ants still can not resist the delicious goodness Terro puts in these traps. Now, I have only spent a single day with these and seemingly only lured them out to feed, BUT i am hopeful these will begin working and I will leave the 5 traps overnight and view the situation in the morning - HOPEFULLY I will have successfully infiltrated the queen and killed her along with the colony. Obviously the company recommends a couple weeks to see results, but based on what I see now along with others reviews, I don’t think they stand a chance. I will update in a few days with the ant infiltration among my carpet and I hope it’s a good situation by then.
UPDATE:
So here we are, about 24 hours later and oh. my. god. these traps work. When I came and looked this morning there are far less ants than yesterday! In the last two photos I added, you’ll see just how many ants there are now and boy is it less than before. Now, I’m unsure if the lesser number means that I’ve successfully infiltrated the colony and killed them off, or if their tummies are just full from eating so much - either way, I don’t see nearly as many today. The ones still present are certainly moving slower than before, my guess is these Terro traps are penetrating their stomach and killing them off (this is what I hope). Overall, with this intense decrease in ants after only about 24 hours, I am impressed and will certainly be ordering more as Spring rolls through and I’m sure they’ll be back if I haven’t killed them all. I will update once more in a few days as well just to give my final thoughts but so far, I’m sticking with the 5/5 stars! I also have someone coming to spray in a few days, but if these are working I may just send them away!",positive

Tried all the natural products first, cinnamon, peppermint, other non chemical sprays. They'd work for a day or two and then they'd be back. Tried borax and diatomaceous earth, they worked a little better but they still returned. Got this product, put one down at the base of kitchen cabinets where the dog couldn't get to it. Within a couple hours, noticed a steady flow of hundreds of tiny ants getting the bait and back inside the wall. About three hours later, they were gone!! Never to return. It's been a month, no more issue. Repeated the same process in my den and again a few hours later, ants were gone and haven't returned. I followed a tip from another reviewer - I put a small piece of foil down with painters tape holding the edge down, tipped the bait slightly to put a drop out on the foil. Boy did they flock to that.

There was still liquid in it so I pour a drop out to lure the ants, put out a new fresh one and let it sit another 2 weeks. Again an invasion... waited 2 more weeks but see no more ant. So that took a full month and I am leaving one of these on my countertop for any that may come looking. (These were tiny ants) FYI.. do not bother to twist off the top to open a packet. I'd already read how hard it was to do that, so just have a scissor ready and drop 1drop and lay the packet there, no ants ever went inside for long. You need to pour some so they definitely partake and take it back to the whole bed that will die. They circle thick around the poured out dot of goop.

17,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",TERRO,$12.28 - $31.97,5,"we just moved in to our new house less than a month ago and almost immediately we had ants coming in to all rooms as if our house was going to bust at the seams. even places with no food. and we keep everything in our pantry pretttyyy sealed up and make sure we clean up messes and run the vacuum daily. AND we used our pest control spray that we usually use. and did all the other tips with vinegar etc etc.

BUT THEY STILL CAME IN RELENTLESSLY EVERYWHERE. This picture is from our master bedroom CLOSET, and we placed them in 5 other places -basically each room in the house where we knew there where secret entry portals somewhere. I spent the whole day finding all their secret portals while waiting for these to be shipped.

after reading like every review I knew to cut off with scissors and that they’d be kind of messy and spill out so I used paper towel /cardboard. and actually spilling it out helped since the design doesn’t really make sense.

after several hours they were almost gone and by morning, zilch. now it’s afternoon and still none!

we had made an appt for pest control to come Monday but honestly if we don’t see anymore this weekend we might cancel and see how it goes.

PS- it’s a GOOD thing if they all start coming in droves, that mean you found the secret portal and they’re gonna take it all back to their colonies. it’ll get worse before it gets better. I’m surprised ours went away so fast with how many we’ve had over this past month we lived here.",positive

And t his pack had a lot in it, so when ants show up much later, I put a fresh one down and don't worry.

I have two cats, and so far they are not attracted to these nor do they bother them. I tend to put one down by a wall and prop a tall book or binder or something in front, or even cardboard, against t he wall, so it's like a hidden tent. But even then they don't seem t o care, and it's been safe so far!

When i get down to my last one, i WILL be ordering another box to keep on hand. One has been enough to take care of a problem for some time. So one box lasts a while. A++ Still buy again.",positive

Okay. I plugged it in, pushed one of the setting buttons (standard) and the light came on and the little fan makes a little bit of breeze, but wet a finger and hold it at the bottom and it is breezing out.

It is also bigger than I expected, but I have such a tiny bug issue in this place, I don't care as long as it works. Something was mentioned about it works better in lower light levels. So. I plugged it in and set it up in a place I have been having issues. Four hours later, I pick it up to look down in. There's a lot more than one gnat on the mat already. It's doing the job. Great.

The local little winged wildlife has resisted: letting the pots dry out good between waterings, watering with a mix of hydrogen peroxide and water, top mulching the pots, and the yellow sticky trap things. This seems to be vacuuming them up. YAY! If this works out I will get a couple more as I have plants in a few areas in my house.

Trust me, I have at least six different microbugs including fruit flies, fungus gnats (arrgh!), a different gnat, and not sure exactly but a few are like tiny tiny various sorts of beetles... keeping the swarms down would be wonderful, without killing my plants. I will update this as it goes..

The picture isn't quite truelight because it is fairly dark in there, but. That's what it sorta looks like ON in the dark. To the right that is a matte BLACK surface that it's reflecting off of.

Edit: my house is large, my buggie collection is way down on one end of the house where I have my first one, but. I just got a second one, also scratchNdent, to deal with the other end.

I seen where someone complained that it is a fly-spa. This will NOT work on houseflies. They are too big and strong to be whooshed down onto the sticky pad. There are other ones built ($60-80) as wall sconces that WILL do the houseflies. This isn't built for that.

However all the assorted little gnats and such are collecting at alarming rates on my sticky pads. It is nice to sit at my computer in the evening and not kill at least a dozen tiny assorted buggies. And my fungus gnat problem that came in with some potting soil mix, is pretty much gone.

I can't say enough, if you have a grow booth and issues with little critters, that putting one of these in the booth at about two weeks for a night will not affect your grow and if there is anything in there it will clear out most of the problems. I have one room where the booth and most of my houseplants live (plus my spring starts as I go into that season as I update this) and the first one is outside the grow booth on the floor where it clears
that room pretty well.

Second one installed near the kitchen sink and other bathroom on other end of house, as there is a persistent problem there. I don't think it will catch sewer flies but those tend to respond to hot vinegar flushed through a running disposal with hot sink water, then follow with a cut up lemon and some icecubes run through the disposer. I will let you know if I get those little buggers back and if it can catch one or not.

On both I am turning them off during the day and on after dark, as that is when the UV light seems to be the most visible to the little winged pests. I also want to see if the kitchen one will draw spiders. There are a few kinds that are drawn to dead prey, and though I have sticky traps for them, if this will be able to stick one down or not if it comes to check it out. Another thing I will update.

Edit update. Plant area one is catching mostly gnats, vatloads of them. Kitchen has only a few, but is getting the fruit flies from the bananas. I put spider traps near both and the kitchen catch is up. Could not be happier with both Katchys. Have spring bedding and flower starts going and a new grow in the tent. I’ve put one in the tent a few times and no gnattie problem (last time will be day/ night 18 so as not to mess up auto blooming). No chemicals. Still worth the price. Replacing the sticky pads is super easy too.

Edit: very late fall. We are the house servants of two mixed breed part Persian purries. The grey and white one in particular has very fine hair and a very full coat despite daily brushing/grooming. So we have slightly pre-used fur all over. Plus lots of house dust-joys of where we live. I have to take a q-tip to the top of both my Katchy’s weekly to keep the house glorp from obstructing airflow (also have to do it to our tower fans). Still catching the tiniest no-see-ums, fungus gnats and fruit flies. With fall garden harvest, the fruit flies moved in. I added a capful of apple cider taped off with a few holes next to the kitchen one, and it was literally carpeted with fruit flies in the bottom. The plants that came in brought micro buggies, and those numbers are quickly dropping as well.

A Katchy doesn’t instantly get your population but in days you should have a disgusting collection on the bottom pad… I purchased a no- zap UV/sticky pad catcher meant for houseflies and installed over the toilet at the ceiling. It also does the job with a little time. So. Katchy do their job well, are easy to use and maintain, and paired with a true flycatcher, really helps keep you unbothered. $40 well spent.",positive

I set up Katchy last night in the bathroom that seems to be the source of these tiny moth-like pests that emerge from our drains each summer. By morning, it had caught 25-30. There were one or two drain flies on the window and shower curtain, but morning usually finds closer to a dozen clinging to the room's vertical surfaces.

We've tried everything we could think of to eliminate drain flies, including pouring gallons of bio-gel drain cleaner down our sinks to replacing our our 70-year-old home's main drain line out to the sewer. Every July or August, the drain flies return as our underground pipes get warm enough to drive them inside.

My hope, at this point, is that running Katchy around the clock will make a noticable dent in our drain fly population within a week.

• I witheld one star because I can't speak to Katchy's longevity. It could be dead in a week, but then so could any of us.

• I was also disappointed that Katchy came with only four glue board and that the company's replacements cost $1.75 a piece sold as an eight pack. Fortunately, compatible non-Katchy glue boards can be found on Amazon for 50 cents a piece. That's about the same unit price as the much stickier Pest Pro Mouse, Spider, Roach & Insect Glue Boards I use in the furnace room to trap insects. Using a pair of scissors, one could probably cut two Katchy-size glue boards out of every 8""x5"" Pet Pro glue board.",positive

I am SUPREMELY disappointed because I was so excited at the thought of having an effective method to combat my nemesis that is the mischievously thriving fruit fly colony which plagues me, and this item arrived this morning broken. :( The blades of the fan internally are not connected and are banging about inside. Though I don't normally pay full price for things unless necessary (I either wait for a good sale or use applicable coupons/promo codes), I took the plunge on this purchase due to my need for a competent and efficient resolve combined with it's GLOWING reviews! First, I had to wait 9 days to receive the item, which I wasn't happy about, but not upset either. I have literally been checking tracking daily and looking forward to it's arrival. Then it arrives *HAPPY DAY*. I opened the package, removed the unit (felt/heard something odd but didn't think too much of it at that moment), reviewed the directions, plugged it in and although the light came on, the fan did not. I thought maybe I need to press a particular button or what-have-you, so I re-read the directions. Nope, it should be automatic. So I then began inspecting the unit and realized the fan blades were not connected. I then even looked for a way to open the unit without busting it so that I can fix it myself (I'm incredibly handy and that's how much I wanted this to work!). No go. I could probably open it up, but then it wouldn't be returnable. Ok, so THEN I go to the item link on Amazon and as of earlier today, it said ""This item is currently unavailable"" followed by something to the effect of 'and we don't know if or when it will become available'. I attempted to contact the seller to no avail. My only viable option was and is to return it. I don't want to return it for a refund or leave a bad review. Rather, I want the working unit I paid and patiently waited for. Errrrr. I decided to go about my day knowing I'd come back to this later and here I am. ... I pull the item up this evening, it is in fact available again, but instead of the $39.79 price I paid 9 days ago, it is right now (6/15/2018) listed at $54.49. Whaaaa?? So I am leaving this review in hopes that the seller will contact me and make good on my purchase, at which point I would update my review to reflect the working conditions of this seemingly enigmatic device.

In summary, this 1 star review encompasses only that the item arrived broken and therefore did not operate as intended. A working unit may very well be worthy of all it's positive reviews. And maaaaybe even the new $54.49 price.

I hope I am a unique case. I also hope this review was of help to you.

Update 6/17/18:
The seller contacted me today apologizing for my inconvenience and explaining that Amazon is responsible for the damage done during the shipping of this product. I responded immediately that I appreciate the response and although I completely understand that Amazon assumes the shipping responsibility, I am also concerned that I cannot repurchase a working unit at the price I paid 2 weeks ago. I inquired how this can be rectified, stating that I fully intend to update my review according to their level of service and the actual benefits of a working unit.  And now I await their response.

Honestly, if I have to repurchase at the higher price, I won't and I'll leave my review star at 1. It's not the price as much as the principle. Products can be damaged in shipping, that's understandable. But the seller is also responsible for commitment. So I'm really hoping they come through with a reasonable resolve that honors the price I paid for a working unit. I'll keep you posted.

Update 7/1/18:
The seller not only replaced my originally bought unit, but included extras as well. They have been extremely diligent in correspondence and I can honestly say that I am not only satisfied, but impressed.

With that said, I would not have altered my review to 5 stars for customer service alone. ...these units works amazingly! The home I live in was built in 1924 and does not sport insulation the way a new home would. So pests are/can be/were a problem. The units do in fact attract flying things very well! The sticky pad of results had 2 bugs I didn't know I had and don't recognize. I am extremely happy with my purchase! And may very well buy more.

The unit itself is aesthetically pleasing and is relatively quiet. Night is the best time for results since that's when it's darkest and the bugs can 'see' the light. The blue light transitions in brightness, which is even more effective in attracting it's prey.

I'm changing my review from a 1 star to a 5 star. I saw other reviews stating it was a flimsy design. I do get what they're saying, but how thick must this unit be to rectify that?? It works as intended and looks good doing it. The bottom is easy to open to check and/or replace the sticky pad. There are only 2 buttons so it's super easy to operate. And it doesn't look like a bug catcher at all. No one would know. So I feel it's 'flimsiness' (is that a word?) is of no concern. As long as it performs, who cares how heavy or thick it is?

This is 5 stars from someone who had to work for it. I hope this review helped you! Happy bug hunting :)",positive

It did catch normal house flies, though they were not as drawn to the light or noise like gnats/fruit flies or mosquitoes. My only frustration was the amount of dust that built up in the top fan part and there was no way to open it to clean it out so it was just accumulating and I did notice it wasn't working as well. I tried the vaccum hose and nothing seemed to work and I was getting really frustrated but then I decided to use a spray can duster (like for a computer keyboard) and it worked like a charm.

There were a couple of times when a fly flew out when I opened the bottom. I guess a strong fly gets away from the sticky pad.

It does what it’s supposed to do and it looks great doing it!! It’s super easy to use. None of the other bug-removal attempts I’ve tried have worked (though I haven’t been very proactive about anything else, which is why I’m enjoying this thing since I barely have to do anything!)

I finally decided I needed to do something this summer. I’ve been living in the same place for 5 years and bugs have never been a huge problem, but for some reason the mosquitos are way worse this year. I think it’s probably because I over-watered my lawn, so they’re out in droves. Also my indoor plants have very recently gotten infected with these horrible little gnats (they look a lot like fruit flies, but they live in soil). This machine has significantly reduced both the gnats + mosquitos that have been inside in the last couple weeks since I started using it.

The bugs aren’t sticking to the paper very well anymore, one just flew off of it when I went to take this photo, so it’s probably time to change that (there is a pack of the sticky papers included with your purchase). It could not possibly be easier to switch them out for a new one, the designers of this definitely thought of how to make it as hassle-free as possible. Also great that it’s easy to access because I love opening this thing periodically to see how many more bugs we’ve gotten in there.

Just buy it. If you’re at the point where your bug problem is bad enough that you’re wondering if it’s worth shelling out for one of these, then you should go for it. I really don’t think you’ll regret it.

Some other reviews mentioned that you could make your own sticky paper instead of buying more from this company. I think that’s a great idea for anyone whose handy. As someone who is way too lazy with this kind of stuff to ever make my own, I’m happy to keep buying the sticky pads from this company until the end of time.

Hope that helps and good luck with your bugs!",positive

The zapping model apparently killed nothing. The bottom tray remained empty, even when I positioned it right near the window where the bugs were sneaking in. I would have left a bad review, but that model is no longer for sale on Amazon - I wonder why...

The Katchy has done well and continues to run 24/7. I finally changed the sticky board after a month and numerous problems ""removed"". I noticed a different within the first 24 hours of plugging it in, and it continues to deliver. I wish it was a bit quieter, but it does a great job and I have been running it on the slower fan speed the entire time of this test. I even swapped tested the location of this one and the other zapper mentioned above, and this one was the only one that continued to kill bugs including all kinds of bugs. Great product.

I can't speak for those people but for myself this thing absolutely catches bugs. The one big downside is that this thing is hard to clean.

So you probably have to replace the machine (not the traps, the MACHINE) once a year. You can prolong the life of the machine by making sure it isn't placed near dusty areas. And that you turn it off during the day when you're not using it. I'd also try vacuuming the top of the machine once in a while to get it ""unclogged.""

I'm not sure how well this would work in a bigger apartment or a house (you might need multiple depending on how many areas you have flies in) but for my 1BR apartment it's worked great. One word of caution - maybe it's just me and my morbid curiosity, but I wouldn't recommend opening the trap often to see how many flies have been caught. The fly trap part has a grating so you can see the flies, but it's dark and you don't get a full view of the trap. I opened the trap compartment and a fly was able to get out.

I tried using the product on a breezy evening and as I suspected, the wind impacted the effectiveness. While I think there were fewer mosquitoes (just a guess), I was getting bitten and decided to go back inside. I do think it’s effective if it is not too windy. Will buy some more repellent and continue using it.

(Original Post). Let's start with the most important question...does it work? It does work (or at least has worked for me and my specific set up)...more about that shortly. And I will continue to use it (and purchase more repellant refills). Why only 4 stars? Instructions need to be improved and not quite sure about the value proposition (cost) for the repellents. But the product has worked for me so far (several hours of use) and I really hate mosquitos. And I did not have to put on bug repellent to keep them from pestering me.

After reading several reviews and wanting to gain access to my patio without being attacked by mosquitos, I decided to buy this and give it a try. I decided on the battery operated version for my patio. The setup instructions were not clearly written (I will provide the information I wish they had provided shortly as well).

I am not a entomologist or an aerosol vapor flow expert...that said, here are my observations and recommendations.

1.) I don't believe the graphic that shows a 20"" protective bubble is reasonable representation of what to expect from the product. The unit emits a vaporized repellent into the air (visualize the smoke from a candle) which is highly influenced by wind or, a ceiling fan. As the repellent is diluted to into the air, the effect dissipates, meaning less protection from mosquitos. The graphic shows a group of people sitting outdoors with a bubble shield, exactly 20 feet around them. If there is no wind, maybe that depiction is a somewhat reasonable representation. But when you set an expectation that there is a protective bubble, people will take it literally. Hence the 1 star reviews that says it does not work.

In my situation, I am on covered porch where there is a wall behind me and to the left of me but the front and right side are completely open to the wind. So there is a ""pocket"" where the repellent is protected from from being completely dissipated or blown downwind. This would seem to me to be the ideal set up for this device. Haven't tried turning on the ceiling fan on the porch. If the results are significantly different, I will update this review.

2. Confusing instructions included in the box at best. Here is a suggestion...how about a QR code that takes you to a video called first use. Let me summarize the information I believe needs to clearly provided:

a) Plug the unit in before use (instructions said this). You will see 3 chasing dots (blinking on and off in a chasing pattern) until the unit is charged (instructions have some confusing series of gray and white dots that does not look anything like what the unit looks like while it's charging). When fully charged, the three dots above the charging port will be on. Also, no word on whether you can plug the unit into a wall socket and use it while it is recharging. And the instructions do not say it takes 5 hours to charge when the battery is completely depleted (that is what the support person told me). Also guessing the unit does not trickle charge when charging is complete...so you probably should not leave it plugged in for extended periods of time.

b) The repellent is in a small plastic container with a lid. The instructions in the box don't really show you how to hold the lid to remove it (there is a confusing drawing with two diagonal arrows which wasn't useful at all). Hold the sides of the bottle with your thumb and forefinger. Hold the front and back center of the lid in the center with the thumb and forefinger of your other hand. Separate. Just like the picture on the Amazon website (which I just saw).

c) How about a recommendation on turning it off after your use and whether to remove the repellent container and put the lid back on. Absolutely nothing said in the instructions. Also, maybe recommend charging the unit so it will be ready for your next use? What if you are not going to use it for a week or a month...should you not leave the unit plugged in to a charger for extended periods? Again, it would be useful to know if you can use the unit while it's plugged in and recharging.

3. General thoughts about toxicity: Google mosquito deaths and the results say mosquitos kill over 1 million people a year. One of the prominently displayed 1 star reviews talks about the toxicity and that you can get headaches or dizziness. Everyone is different and I enjoy being outside without having to put insecticide on my skin. I have not gotten headaches or dizzy. Your results may vary.

Now I want to compliment Thermacell on their customer support. They answered the call pretty quickly, were very helpful and pleasant to work with. Also, very generous warranty.

I have written this whole review sitting on my porch and did not have a single mosquito come near me. Houston, Texas, in May on light breeze afternoon.

Again, I would recommend it to friends and would buy it again.

Now for some unsolicited advice to Thermacell. Seems to me you have way too many versions of this product which confuses the buyer. Also, it appears the repellents have changed over time with some of your later repellents that are ""safer"" than your earlier versions. Might be useful to make this information more explicit if correct. Hopefully you are reconciling what products to sell and which products to sunset. Also, on the box that is covered with pictures and graphics, the actual product version was in smaller print and greyed out (easily overlooked). So it took me a minute to find it when support asked me what device I was calling about.

Very simple electronics upgrade...I would recommend resettable timers on the device indicating battery life and how much time remains before the repellent needs to be replaced. Either LED timer display (not 3 LED lights) on the device or bluetooth app on your phone. Seems obvious you are using the ""razor and blade"" method of pricing for product, where razors are cheap but the blades (refills) are where you generate your profits. The unit works well enough that a little upgrade to provide the user more information about battery life or how long until I need to replace the repellent cartridge would justify paying extra for the ""razor"". Just one opinion and you have been in the business for 20 years...so you know what your are doing.",positive

It emits a weak insecticide, allethrin, a synthetic version of a naturally occurring insecticide found in chrysanthemum flowers (similar to pyrethrin) - but less lethal and at levels that probably couldn't kill a mosquito even directly over the emitter. Still it works...

How it works is simply by creating an area that mosquitos don't want to be, to lurk or hover. By doing so, it dramatically decreases the number of mosquitos in an area, but.... You need to start the emitter about 10-15 minutes in advance of going into the garden area you intend to sit in - so that the mosquitos mostly depart - it doesn't work if you go out and then start the E55, they'll see you before it makes them want to leave. If you set it running for 10-15 minutes in advance most of the mosquitos aren't there to see and bite you ... It's not perfect - the odd mosquito will get into your area and bite, just a lot fewer than before. And when they say a 10-15' radius, that's the maximum, so you may want to put two out anyway. But it works, and most of the rest, including Citronella don't work or don't work as effectively.

Why should you get more than one.... well first, it's nice to put one under a table as well as on top. Second, it's nice to not have your sojourn in the end when the charge runs out (you can plug it in and indeed use a travel usb battery.). If you do get more than one, get multiple colors so you can tell them apart (and unfortunately the 9.5 hour comes only in black.)

But really, to keep mosquitos under control you need a multipoint strategy .... Insect Shield for clothing - send it to Insect Shield for better treatment (and Aedes Aegypti is no longer killed by permethrin, but they do dislike it), Mosquito Repellent (I used to use DEET but it's unpleasant and have switched to the marginally more effective Picardin) and finally, policing the area around your garden with Mosquito Dunks in every place water accumulated for more than a few days (and them from drain grates above the sump so some gets washed in), encouraging you neighbours to do the same. Outdoor fans are also a good solution - they disrupt the mosquito's flight - they are weak flyers.

So, tedious, but there's no magic bullet - but if you use

a. Thermacell (in advance of going outside)
b. Picardin or Deet repellent
c. Insect Shield treat clothing (good for 70+ washes)
d. set up fans over seating areas.
e. Police for standing water nearby and drain it or put Mosquito Dunks in it (including dishes under plant pots, etc.)

You will make it tolerable...",positive

Now, granted, we are working within the limits of the machine -- it works best if there's no breeze, so if there is a slight wind we try to block it by putting the machine against a wind break. And we don't expect it to work more than about a 10' radius. But so far, every time we've used it, not a single mosquito has landed.

For those who claim that this product is toxic, I would ask them to please provide a reference to a peer reviewed journal article with that proof.

A few pieces of advice…. it is IMPERATIVE that the unit is placed outside 15 minutes (as instructed) before you go outside. This gives the repellent a chance to work. They are also NOT PLAYING when they say that it works in a 20-ft. area. If the area you need coverage for an area larger than that, you will need multiple units.

Also, when the cartridge is down to the last few drops, just go ahead and replace the cartridge! Otherwise, mosquitoes will just attack you outta nowhere; there is no way to gauge how long those last few drops are going to last!

Lastly, when you’re finished using it, make it a habit to charge it, so it’ll be ready to go the next time you need it!!

I really don't think there could have been an easier or cheaper solution. All we did was crush up some crackers to use as bait, sprinkle the crumbs in the middle of the glue trap, and set the trap under the heat register where we had seen the bugs coming from.

Within just a few hours of placing the first trap, the silverfish had made their way to the trap and started to get stuck. I caught over 30 individuals on one single trap at first! The subsequent uses of the traps caught fewer bugs each time, as in the interest of reducing suffering, I didn't leave the next traps out as long before I placed them in the freezer to put the stuck creatures out of their misery.

There were a few unintended insect and arachnid casualties while using the traps to catch the silverfish but thankfully, I didn't happen to catch anything bigger than a junebug. I would absolutely not be surprised if larger critters did get stuck to it though, the traps are VERY sticky.

Some of the pictures I saw, the people just put the trap in the middle of the room. Of course that won't work, what are the odds that the silverfish will travel a path to the trap?

It's awesome and I no longer see silverfish scurrying along my bathroom floor. I live in a highrise, so no question that they are somewhere in the walls, but if they make their way into my bathroom (which is really the only place I used to see them in the past) then it's a one-way trip. Mind you they seem to like to move around when it's dark or shadowy, so they get trapped when I'm not around. Ideal.

I catch fewer roaches with these than the unscented ones, which makes me suspect they recognize to avoid the odor. The seem to run around them. I think the only time they run into them is if they're startled and panic. It definitely doesn't attract them, I saw someone say that they put bait on the traps because the peanut butter scent was not attracting them. I didn't find the bait drew them either.

If I'm lucky enough to catch a roach with one of these, the others definitely avoid it. Out of curiosity I tried flipping the trap upside down once it caught a roach, so it was stuck to the ""ceiling"" of the trap, and later found another. So if they see a roach trapped it seems to warn the others away. The roach motels may catch more than one, I guess because they don't see the bodies before it's too late?

The glue on these though is super strong. It's hard to unstick your fingers if you accidentally touch the wrong parts. And if you fold it wrong you may not be able to realign it. I've seen complaints with other traps that bugs escaped, they are not going to escape these, ever.

Because they're so sticky it's difficult to cut them up. But I've tried cutting them up and lining them up along the edge of one of the cabinets. It appears roaches won't go in there now, either that or they found a different entrance.

Some people suggest these as a monitor to get an idea of the roach population and where they might wander, but if the roaches avoid them for the most part, it isn't too useful I guess. I use these in conjunction with bait. I will probably add a growth regulator. The apartment building I live in has a pretty bad infestation and the landlord doesn't take care of it.

It is very satisfying though when they catch one. But then I guess if you catch one there's millions more, ick.",fair

It is inhumane to catch an animal like this, and while disturbing, we can't live with mice in our homes. As I understand it, some stores do not carry the glue boards for this very reason.

I really like the blue my hose and nozzle came in. It's a very vivid blue.
The nozzle is amazing. A little heavy but so many options!
The length is great.
The shut off valve at the end of the hose here the hose connects into the nozzle is such a neat feature. I wish I had it on the rest of my hoses.

I gave three stars for durability as I've only had it a short time so not sure how durable it will be in a years time of sitting in the Texas heat, sun and other elements.

Cons:
When you shut the water off, it shrivels up. And I mean FAST. You have to make sure you pull in plenty of slack by your spigot/faucet that you have it hooked up to or it will pull dangerously on your spigot.
It's rather heavy and with the 100ft length, the hose will just stretch instead of move. So, you have to sometimes grab the middle and pull that towards where you want it to go to prevent the stretching and possible stress on your nozzle connections.
Make sure your finger isn't inside the catch area where you can have the nozzle stay on by not pressing down on the handle. I had my finger in there popping the metal piece up to shut my nozzle off thinking it would have the same lack of spring back like all of my other nozzles. Nope, that thing pinched my finger good.

Been in a new house, and earlier this summer, we were getting a cock roach encounter almost nightly all of a sudden. Our cats are very good at detecting, finding, and playing with them, otherwise I don't even know if we'd of known. I put this stuff around the house outside, I did the inside of my garage, both around the walls and the garage door, and also in the gaps between the concrete rectangles. Got those same gaps down my driveway leading to the garage as well.

Still had a few encounters initially, but they slowed down, and basically stopped. Might get 1 every 3 to 4 weeks now. I started finding bodies in the garage every now and then, and that stopped too. This stuff doesn't kill these insects instantly, it seems to hurt them over time. Ones you find, will be slower, sometimes basically dying.

I did not spray inside, aside from the garage. I was going to spray inside, if we didn't see results, but it seemed to have worked. Either the spray worked and has done wonders, or the pests may have been a time of year thing, or related to construction in the area, I'm not sure. But as far as I can tell, this stuff worked for us.

Nothing survives boric acid, they crawl through it and take it to their hiding spaces/nests. It attaches to their bodies and cuts them while they continue to spread it by crawling. Boric acid takes patience though it kills in 2-5 days. They have that stuff at the dollar store. I live in a twin home so when my neighbor (insecticide) bombs her house is when I have problems.

Sometimes not. Will they eventually die? Same answer. It depends on how patient you are. That is why people get weekly, biweekly or monthly treatments with the pest professionals.

90,"Patio, Lawn & Garden","TERRO T300 Liquid Ant Baits, 6 Bait Stations",$5.97,5,"This is an easy, inexpensive, low-toxicity means of fighting off ant infestations. I use these bait stations in combination with the Terro liquid ant killer in 2-ounce bottles: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015031R8

Be smart:
1) keep areas free of other food sources -- trash cans, pet bowls, food spills, etc.
2) trace the ants back as far as you can to where the enter the room/cupboard/pantry
3) place the bait stations on the ant trail as close to that entry point as is convenient -- you don't want it where it will get stepped on, disturbed/consumed by pets or people, or spilled on a porous surface.
4) rubbing a little of the bait liquid around the edge of the opening can speed ""discovery"" of the bait
5) once the bait is placed, you want to wipe out the ants that are already on the trail extending past the bait stations. I like to suck them up with a vacuum hose.
6) finish by removing the scent laid along the trail by the ants. I use a bleach-based cleaning spray on tile, countertops, and vinyl flooring. For other surfaces, you might distilled (clear) vinegar but I don't have personal experience with that.

Most often, I supplement or replace the bait stations with the bottled liquid Terro. I put strips of painter's tape down and put drops of bait along the tape. This is a much more economical way to deal with large numbers of ants.

I understand the complaints about the new design, but I prefer it. The older design would spill sticky bait with the slightest touch. Ignore the ""snap-off"" description for the new design and cut it with scissors. Rub some bait on the outside edge of the neck where ants can smell it easily and they will find a way to get into the bait station (especially if you have been able to remove the scent trail beyond the station.

91,"Patio, Lawn & Garden","TERRO T300 Liquid Ant Baits, 6 Bait Stations",$5.97,5,"I highly recommend these ant baits. They look a little More conspicuous than some of the “house” baits with the spiral entrances and such which originally turned me off to them. But, I will say that these are hands down the BEST baits I’ve used around the house.

Some of the stand out for these baits is that they work fast. We had sugar ants in a few locations in the kitchen and within two (2) days of putting the bait down, they were cleared out. I put the bait down near the scout ants and within minutes they had diverted and a new line into the bait was formed. Just that easy.
Another line of ants sprouted up a few days later in a new location, across the room, so I moved the bait and those ants also crawled in and started the buffet. Within a day that line was also gone.
You can see in the pictures there are a few ants that die in there. Maybe drown or perhaps they are eating more than they can handle or coming back for more and succumbed to the bait finally. No matter, the other ants still went in without hesitation.
The bait lasts a long time and was really effective. So, a great value for the cost. I bought the larger pack and have only had to use two to finish off multiple lines over a span a 2 months. And there is still liquid in the pack in case another line sprouts up through the summer.

The only downsides I will say are the look, design and a lack of adhesion.
The look just makes them stand out a little more than the ones that are solid color, can be stuck to the wall and have multiple openings. The opening is not flush to the ground and not being able to stick it to a horizontal surface wasn’t an issue, like I was concerned about, either. I had no issues with ants finding their way into the bait. And, honestly, once I got used to the look of the bait it didn’t catch my attention anymore than the classic, big-name brands we are used to.
Removing the cap to open the bait is more difficult than just sticking one of the other brands to a wall or behind the fridge. But, once you have the cap off, you can place these on any flat surface without a problem. The ants are attracted to it more so than other brands I have used, drawing a solid line of ants, as if they were so excited they told their friends about the new food source.

I highly recommend Terri liquid ant baits.

92,"Patio, Lawn & Garden","TERRO T300 Liquid Ant Baits, 6 Bait Stations",$5.97,5,"Once upon a time there were ants living within the impenetrable walls of an apartment. With three stories and 10 units to choose from, the colony had a plethora of places to hide and torment humans. One summer, the ants joined forces with a neighboring colony and their numbers became staggering as they entered residences through light sockets, nail holes and any crack or crevice through which their bodies could fit in each apartment. Babies cried, women cursed and men stayed out longer then they needed to to avoid the chaos. Times were great for the ants.
Then, one day, a woman who had lived in the apartment for almost 10 years had absolutely had enough of the ant’s BS and took to Facebook to ask her human friends what to do. They, in unison, recommended TERRO ant traps. With the speed of Amazon prime she ordered the 6 pack of traps. To her surprise, the traps arrived faster than she anticipated and she feverishly tore apart the packaging to reveal the gift from the Gods.
As an expert package opener, she dismembered and arranged the contents of the tiny box and decided where she would lay her deadly contraptions.
With each location the human became more hopeful that she would eliminate her ant foe for good. Within an hour the ants came in full force for the trap in her bathroom. Through the cracks of the cabinets they descended in their masses to carry the seeds of death back to their beloved queen and families. Unknowingly carrying the contents of their own demise. Three days the ants marched tirelessly, undisturbed (as directed on the packaging) in their activities, and on the third day the final workers returned to bring the corpses home to their mass colonial grave, never to return again.

My humiliation and sadness turned into a blind rage. I needed to even the score. I wasn't going to let them get away with this. So I devised a plan. I was going to poison them. Not a quick poisoning, but a slow one. One where they would unknowingly bring the poison back to their subterranean lair. So I put my sinister plan into motion. Bait was placed in the cupboards and cabinets, on countertops... Everywhere I could think of... It didn't take long for them to find it. Their numbers swelled as more of them discovered my trap. They obviously thought that I was an idiot for setting up what appeared to be an all-you-can-eat syrup buffet. It was all for them. But I was the one that was laughing. I called them names as they lapped up that sickly sweet death nectar. I cursed their existence. I remember telling them to ""just wait, you bastards!"". And so I waited patiently while they took the sappy and succulent sustenance back to their nest. After a couple of days, their numbers had dwindled. I would see a few here and there. They looked sluggish and drunk and I knew the poison had begun to take effect. I was giddy. Overjoyed. Proud that I had turned the table on the marauding intruders. Before I knew it, the ants were virtually gone. The few stragglers that were left were greeted with my middle finger.

For my small ants the required technique was to cut the container and pour the sticky liquid onto an index card that had 1 edge taped to the floor so the ants could access the bait (i.e. sticky liquid). After several hours the index card was black with ants that appeared to be dead but were not because 24 hours later all the ants were gone having taken the bait back to their headquarters. A few ants (1 to 5) appeared daily until after about 7 days all the ants were gone and now weeks later none have returned.

97,"Patio, Lawn & Garden","TERRO T300 Liquid Ant Baits, 6 Bait Stations",$5.97,5,"After the success I have had with this product I am never without a batch of bait stations on hand in case of ants.

The first three times I had to use these they worked in about three days, even though the instructions say it could take two weeks. I never understood why the heck they give such a long timeline when it has always worked so fast for me.

Then the last time I needed to use it, the ants did not go away in three days or even a week. It literally took the entire two weeks. But I have faith in the product and I was patient and it ultimately worked. I just had to deal with the ants crawling around a lot longer this time which was not fun. But I had to trust the process.

I am not an entomologist so this is just a guess. But I suspect the last time took longer because there were much fewer ants present. The way this works is that the ants take the bait back to the queen and the colony to kill the ants at the source. So perhaps with fewer ants taking the bait back, it took longer for the bait to do the job. I don't know, it's a guess. But what matters is that the product ultimately worked and the ants are gone.

This was also rated the #1 ant killer by the New York Times. I very highly recommend this for anyone who has ants.

There is no other indoor ant trap that I can recommend as strongly as I recommend these. I have two dogs and a cat, and they don't mess with the traps at all. They have 0 interest in them.

120,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",Chapin Garden Sprayer,$14.89 - $50.00,5,"For years I've been spraying my garden vegetable plants with hand spritzers. I apply water-diluted sulfur to my squash and melon leaves so they stay green and fresh, and water-diluted fertilizer to my tomato leaves. I need to spray both the tops and bottoms of leaves, but haven't been able to. I kept encountering the same problems with hand spritzers: spritzers that stop working all too soon; spritzers that will spray on tops of leaves, but not under leaves because they don't work when the nozzle is pointing upward; spritzers that can't fit in where I need to spray, so I can't get to the center of the plants; and spritzers that can't hold enough liquid to spray. I finally gave up and bought one of these. Before buying I could see I would be spraying with a wand, and that turned out to be ideal! I can spray in any direction (down or up) and I can reach in where I could not reach before. I'm not going back to hand spritzers!

The included assembly instructions seemed confusing because they are for a number of different models, which made it difficult to figure out what I was supposed to do with this specific 1-gallon product. Turns out assembly and use are easy if you follow these steps:

1) Rinse out the jug. It may contain dust and bits left over from the manufacturing process.

2) Insert the filter-end (perforated cylinder end) of the white plastic tube. This will go to the bottom of the interior of the jug.

3) Secure the white plastic tube you just inserted, on the outside of the jug, with the threaded-fastener that's captive and sliding on the outer hose, put there for this purpose. You're making a water-tight seal, so make sure everything is first seated right, then twist the fastener snugly in place.

4) Attach the wand on the other end of the hose. You are again using a threaded-fastener that is sliding on the hose, and you are again making sure everything is first seated well before twisting snugly in place.

That's it for the permanent assembly! For first-time use and to get a feel for how things work, fill the jug about 1/3 to 1/2 full with plain water. Drop the black pump into the top of the jug, with its handle on the outside. The handle is used to screw the pump into the jug so make sure the handle is down, into, and engaged in the top of the pump. Screw the pump in tightly since this has to be air-tight. Then unscrew the handle just a little, until it is loose and can be lifted up. Pump that handle to increase the pressure in the jug, and do it for longer than you might think necessary. Listen for leaking air where the pump is screwed in, and re-engage the handle into the pump to tighten it more if necessary.

You want a lot of air in the jug so you can pressurize it for a lot of spraying. If you fill the jug too high there may be too little air to pressurize, and you won't be able to spray that much since not a lot will come out. You'll have to interrupt with more pumping sessions to get the pressure back up along the way. There's no law against this, it's just inconvenient. Filling half way or less makes the whole setup lighter for use, too.

The wand has a handle you can squeeze, like at the gas pump, to get the spray going. Twist the end of the wand to change the shape of the spray, as you would with a garden hose.

When you are done spraying, re-engage the pump handle into the pump, unscrew the pump and see and hear the pressure get released at the top of the jug around the edge of the pump.

OK, you've gone through your practice session. Let's spray for real! Add water that dilutes what you are going to spray (use markings along the side of the jug to see 1-liter, 2-liters, quart, half gallon levels) and add your ingredient(s) to the water. You can shake the jug after it has been sealed and pressurized, then spray to your heart's content!

Done for the day? Empty the jug and start again with plain water, then spray to clean everything out. I use this plain-water spray to water plants that could use it. Why waste the water?

I am happy with my purchase, which is not something I always say. Of greatest importance? I see the effect on my plants!. Reliably getting to the undersides of leaves, and deep into bushy plants, are now easy, and really make a difference. They will for you, too.",positive

I live on close to an acre of land and the weeds in the springtime start to grow rapidly. I had been using a 1 gallon tank for years but had to fill it at least 6-8 times in order to get the job done. I bought the 3 gallon tank so that I wouldn't have to constantly keep filling it up to complete the job. The old tank finally quit working and I was looking for a 2 gallon tank to replace it when I came across the Chapin. they offered 1,2,or 3 gallon capacity tanks so I opted for the 3 gallon. Most home owners would probably be fine with a 1 or 2 gallon tank but in my situation, I wanted to give the 3 gallon a try. It worked really well but just be aware that it can be a bit on the heavy side when filled to full capacity. I actually had to carry it to the location to be sprayed and the set it down, then spray the area. The spray nozzle can be adjusted to spray a fine mist or a stream. It can reach a fair distance depending on how much pressure is in the tank. I kept my tank fairly pressurized by pumping it up every so often. I was able to do the entire front lot and both sides of my home on 1 tank. I'm sure I'll be able to do the the back yard as well on 1 tank. So far so good. No Leaks... Construction of tank seems to be quite thick but the pump handle seems a little thin. I'm hoping not to apply too much stress to the handle when pumping but it should be ok since it will be stored out of sun and extreme weather when not in use. the wand is plastic, not brass and it has a pressure release where it connects to the tank which is nice.

 This review covers the original Alpha Grillers Instant Read Meat Thermometer I purchased in February of 2017--and the new upgraded model you see here (June 2020 anyway). The original thermometer was purchased for $15 based on users reviews on Amazon. You can't find images of it here anymore (although you can see it in my picture comparing the 2017 model to the 2020 model), but it worked well enough and I've been mostly happy with it for the last three years. Recently it went from unreliably turning on, to not turning without removing the AAA battery and futzing with it (no corrosion) for 10 minutes. I was disappointed but $15 for three years of service and left out in the elements, I can't complain too much. I started to browse for a replacement and see that Alpha Grillers' has a ""lifetime warranty"" so I email them pictures of the unit, invoice info, etc. I kid you not: two days later, a replacement arrives from Amazon, and it's the latest version. So none of that ""pay for shipping"" the
dead unit back to them, and we'll see what we can do run around. This alone, should convince you that it's worth buying this thermometer since we all know most of the hardware on Amazon is sourced from a giant factory making and selling units to other resellers. It's probably not a question of the difference in the label--it's a difference in the customer support and there, Alpha Grillers gets 5-stars.

Accuracy and response
Since I have the new unit, I wanted to see how accurate it was so I compared it to my Fluke 52 thermocouple thermometer with a Fluke 80PK-2A immersion probe that I had calibrated with a GE Druck DPI-822. I then filled a narrow mouth Pyrex 1,000ml flask with water from our hot water pot that had been set to 208 F and tried to hold both probe tips near each other in the hot water while trying to take a picture with the hand on a phone. The Fluke 52 and 80PK-2A read out at 184.4 while the Alpha Grillers displayed 184.1. As you know, water cools off fast and it's you don't uniform temperature in the container so the 0.3 degree difference could be the actual temperature difference from the probe positions in the hot water or even the probe shaft differences. Basically, the accuracy is excellent for a $20 meat thermometer.

I also wanted to see how fast the Alpha Grillers unit responds so I filled a second small glass container with ice and water and recorded the display as it was dunked from the ice water back into the hot water (which had now cooled off further). You can watch the video above (it goes from removal from ice bath to hot water, and then back to ice bath and again back to the hot water) but it does respond extremely fast but not necessarily ""instant."" To be fair, ""instant"" is more of a marketing term and open to interpretation anyway. ""Instant"" coffee still takes time to add to water and stir for example.

I'd say it takes about 3.5 seconds to respond to the ice bath to hot water--which is ""instant"" for most of us. For example, the Fluke 80PK-2A is far slower by design because it's a non-tapered, thicker, stainless immersion probe that absorbs a lot of the heat and can take a lot more abuse. The more slender tapered Alpha Grillers tapered tip is designed to pierce meat and also responds far quicker since you don't have to heat up a lot of metal.

As far as the design of the unit, like the previous model, it features a hidden magnet to let you stick it to side of your grill which is a great feature, and the hole lets you hang it from a hook as well if your grill's hooks are large enough. The package also comes with four small hook and loop (Velcro) with adhesive on the back if you want to Velcro it to something.

The new model's rubber buttons are also far easier to press than the previous design's plastic bubble-type. New to this model is very even white LED backlighting. Yes, it looks blue in the official marketing pictures but that's the digital camera color temperature at work--it's actually white.

Hold function
Also new is a hold, and min max function. The function is unlike most typical thermometers which typically cycle from room temperature to max temp and min temp. It's pretty thought out here for a meat thermometer. On the older model which doesn't have the old function, I would stick the thermometer in to the meat on the grill and twist my head over to see the current temp. On meat on the rear of the grill this means getting your head into odd angles and also pretty close to the grill.

With the new model, you insert the probe, press the Hold button to activate the hold (it will display HOLD) and read the temp without all the head craning and heat on your face. Press Hold to release the hold function.

One thing I want to point out: the UI for the hold function might be a little confusing because the hold function first requires that you turn on the hold function before you can use it. This occurs from off state to on. So like most, if you have it folded shut, and open to use, you will have to press the Hold button to turn on the mode. That means the first time you want to use it, you'll have to press it twice: Once to activate the hold mode, and once again to do the first hold. After its in its hold mode, it operates the way you expect it to: Into meat, Hold button to read, and Hold button to release. It doesn't turn off until the thermometer is switched off.

Max Min Function
The same Hold button also activates a max and min temp. This again is unlike the typical user interface of a temperature gauge with room temp / max / min cycle with a single click. To read the maximum temperature, you press and hold the Hold button for 3 seconds and it will display the maximum temperature with MAX in the display. Press again and will see the minimum recorded temperature since the unit was on and MIN in the display. One more press and you exit back into the standard mode. Note: you CANNOT the Max/Min function if it is currently in HOLD. You have to do this from the normal operations. Undocumented feature: Alpha Grillers' documentation say to clear the recorded max/min by turning the unit off (folding the thermometer shut) but if you are in the MAX or MIN mode, you can simply press and hold the Hold button for three seconds and it will reset both recorded max and min memories.

Calibration Mode
Unlike the 2017 mode, the 2020 version features a calibrate feature. On the button that lets you switch from Fahrenheit to Celsius, pressing the button for 5 seconds will let you calibrate the unit. The instructions say to put the probe into a container of ice and water by using the Cal (f/c) button or the Hold button to set the calibration point to 32 degrees F or 0 degrees C. Obviously out of the box accuracy is excellent and for meat grilling do you really need this kind of accuracy or to even calibrate? I dunno. I was more afraid of accidentally pressing the calibrate button and throwing it out of whack so I went ahead and pressed the Cal button for 5 seconds which causes the display to show ""CALL"" (yes there's only one L in calibrate) but rather then letting me accidentally mess up the calibration, the thermometer displayed ""ERR"" and then went back into normal operation. My guess is the unit won't even let you calibrate it unless it's in an ice bath first so my worries about screwing up the calibration are pretty unlikely since you'd have to accidentally dunk it into an ice bath first.

Build quality and battery
Unlike the original Alpha Grillers I had which runs off of AAA, the new unit uses (which comes pre-installed) a CR2032 coin cell. I think this is an improvement as AAA kinda stink. They seem to be the most prone to leaking of all the cylinder cells I use (looking at you Kirkland). Lithium coin-cells, though more expsnsive, are more reliable, far less likely to leak (and ruin your unit) and operate at lower temperatures. The higher voltage also means more power for the the advanced functions in the unit too. I can't say anything about battery life as I haven't had the unit long enough, but I'm sure the LED backlight is the largest consumer of power so if you use it sparingly, it'll probably last quite a while.

Water resistance
Alpha Grillers calls it ""water proof"" and in the documentation, it's stated that you can ""fully submerge"" it in water for a short-time so long as the battery compartment is screwed on tightly. I didn't dunk my unit but I have no reason to doubt the water resistance of it. There are no visible screws anywhere on the unit and there is a gasket in the battery compartment (the gasket could be a little larger though to increase the seal as there are no ridges to mate with the gasket on the actual battery cover, just a flat surface). The only ingress of water would likely come through the gasket flattening over time or through the pivot point of the probe.

The previous 2017 model used a small nub switch that the temperature probe boom depresses to switch off or on. This switch has moved to the inside of the unit which also adds to its water resistance. The probe boom itself is very stiff to open and close which also adds to water resistance. I have no idea how the probe is connected to actual controller board inside or how water resistant that is. The 2020 unit actually switches off at about a 45 degrees angle too which is an improvement over the 2017 model which required closing it firmly to switch off. I would often not switch off if you didn't close it correctly.

I think this is plenty of water and dirt resistance for a meat thermometer unless you're a Navy Seal Griller who needs to scuba up from a sub before grilling on the beach. The main take away is you can probably leave this on your grill during inclement weather without worrying about it being killed. The previous model I had did not have any weather resistance claims and also no gasket in the battery compartment which might be how I killed it.

Improvements
Coming from the previous model, it's a big improvement but it's not without complaints. I think the Hold feature is great, but the button is too close to the temperature scale and backlight button. This means you have to angle your thumb to hit it straight on. You're also going to almost always hit that button from an angle which will put more stress on it over time. The other complaint is the hold button should be activated from power on without having to press it once. I suppose this is done to prevent someone from reading the wrong temperature but I'd rather have it on.

Overall the 2020 model is a big improvement over the 2017 model. Currently it's quite a bit more expensive ($15 for 2017 model vs $20 for 2020 model) but I think the improvements are worth it. And let me again point out the customer service Alpha Grillers provides. My old one let go three and half years later and they stood behind it. For a $15 thermometer. Even if they didn't and they said, ""it's been three years bud,"" I'd buy another one with the improvements, accuracy and speed the new model has over the old one.

And yes, I received this unit free, because my old unit died. Alpha Grillers sent it to me as a warranty replacement not to have it reviewed. It did not ask me to write my review, I did it because a company that stands behind its products deserves recognition and is worthy of my time spent.",positive

Frustrating because the entire point of the apartment that I rented was because it has a lovely outdoor.

I don't have enough room in my home to workout, so I workout outside in the backyard. Even with long pants and constant movement, the mosquitoes would get me. I would watch them swarming around me and would normally get 10-15 bites in each 30-40min session. To stop the insanity, I used to spray myself down with DEET. While it stopped the mosquitoes, it also would dry my skin and I'd have to be extra cautious about touching my face / eyes because the sweat would get it everywhere. Plus it's DEET. Who wants to use that everyday?
I decided to try this product after going to a cookout where our friend had these in their yard and it seemed to have worked. Results - only 1-2 bites each session, and no eye sensitivity.
However, I will say that I CAN smell the product. When I'm working out and breathing hard, the last thing I want to do is inhale any sort of chemical or smoke. So I put this at my back and will sometimes turn it off if I feel it's too strong (until I see mosquitoes return). The 7' rule is real, so I keep it right at ~5' from me.

Important, when not in use, throw out the pad, and keep the Thermacell out of reach of pets. We learned the hard way.

Mosquitos are pretty picky about who they prey upon. They prefer a particular scent and blood chemistry which is why I can understand why the reviews range from ""didn't work"" to ""changed my life."" Let's face it - when you're in an area where mosquitos are so thick that you can hear them buzzing and watch them landing on your skin, you should just go inside. Not much is going to save you. However, if you're like me and your skin lights up with a neon sign for the mosquitos (and you are the ONLY one they're biting in a group), you're happy to try just about anything that will keep them away from you.

My husband bought this Thermacell Repeller so I would stop complaining. I still haven't stopped complaining (sorry, honey), but I have stopped flapping my gums about mosquitos. We put this Repeller out on our porch during the beginning of summer, before the mosquitos were really out and about. About mid-summer I started telling my health care provider (and all of my friends) that I must be going through menopause early or having some major blood chemistry change, because mosquitos were no longer seeking me out of a group. As long as we were outside around our home, I just wasn't getting a bite. It was miraculous and beautiful. Then we went to a friend's house. Ouch. They were all over me again. It took me a while to realize (yeah, I'm a little slow) that the reason I wasn't getting bit at home was because my husband had lit the Thermacell each time we were outside. I honestly didn't even realize it was on and running. It doesn't make noise, doesn't product a smell, and doesn't really take up any room at all. Pretty dang amazing. We went through 3 scent pads this summer and one fill of butane and it keeps on going. It's easy to throw in a bag and take anywhere with us. Most everyone who visited this summer has purchased one.

1. The cart is easy to fold/unfold. It stows well!
2. The cart is sturdy and maneuvers well, even on rougher surfaces. The fabric is thicker than other, cheaper carts we considered; however, the side piece of fabric seems very flimsy. I’m worried over time it will tear, which will lead to outward flexing of the metal structure and possible binding of the joints while folding and unfolding the cart. May be a non-issue, but such a weird thing to skimp on…
3. The protective cover is terrible. I slid the cart, in its “protective” bag, into the back of my Forester and it started to come apart at the seems. I guess it need to be gently lowered, not slid into the hatch. What’s the point?
4. The adjustable handle is great. It works well and stows well. Not issues there since, as was mentioned, the cart is very easy to maneuver.

171,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",MacSports Outdoor Utility Wagon,$59.88 - $222.63,4,"This wagon is so cute. I bought it because our Pomeranian, Fred, doesn’t enjoy walks like he used to, but I still want him to enjoy being outside. I loop the leash around the frame to secure him. My dad has joined me on a couple of walks with my parents’ dogs and their Shih Tzu tires easily and ends up riding with Fred when he gets tired.

Pros: It is easy to fold up for storage and comes with a cover that secures at the bottom. It has two pockets - perfect for cell phone, keys, and waste bags. The handle extends, but then snaps into place when it is shortened. The fabric seems to be of good quality. I haven’t had to clean it yet, so I can’t speak to that aspect.

Cons: Really the only concern I have is that is seems a little wobbly at times. I hope that it holds up. To be fair, I am pulling it on the street, but not for very far or long, and Fred is 13 lb so it’s not like he’s pushing the weight limits.

172,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",MacSports Outdoor Utility Wagon,$59.88 - $222.63,5,"I don't usually write reviews but I will make an exception for this exceptional product.

I purchased the cart to schlep groceries and warehouse club purchases from the car. Depending on where I park, multiple trips with heavy items can be frustrating and painful due to aging knees. Thankfully aging also leads hopefully to wisdom and this was a preventative purchase as well as planning for the future.

The cart was fully assembled which is always great. It unfolds easily and folds back up equally easily. It is not heavy and fits easily in the back seat of the car or the half the trunk. My intention is to leave it in the car.

It is large enough to carry 2 full 24 packs of water with room to spare. I try to limit my warehouse runs twice a month so I usually have quite a bit of stuff and with this cart I have been able to bring everything in in one trip including water those humongous rolls of TP and all my purchases. It maneuvers easily and feel sturdy. I do not feel the weight of the packed cart. I do feel more comfortable when things fit in where the sides are so not to slide out. I could thing things tipping if they are not enclosed or on an even surface. The handle telescopes out and locks – I do wonder if the holder for the handle will loosen with time as it just snaps into the frame but it's been a month and so far so good.

The only thing I would mention is to keep an eye on the price there were huge variations in price due to color - and a day or two after I purchased the item the same thing the same color was like $40 more so perhaps use a site like camel camel to know you're getting a decent price. Red does seem to be cheaper but I chose blue for $10 more to match my car - a girl's gotta match!

To say I have used this a lot since purchase would be an understatement; I consider it a game changer. I have no doubt that the same copycat neighbor that bought my exact lawn mower, snow blower dethatcher after seeing this independent woman crushing home maintenance, expecting him to one shortly LOL.

I saw some knockoffs that were a bit cheaper but settled on this. Always buy sold by or fulfilled by amazon and know I’m covered if wrong. Customer service has been very good.

There are lots of wagons out there, I shopped around, and I'm glad I chose this one.
I'm very impressed with the rubber wheels. Many of the cheaper ones have hollow plastic tires. Buyer beware.
These tires pulled smooth on all terrain and were quiet. Another plus over noisy plastic.
It was easy to fold and only slightly heavy to put in my car. (I'm very small)
I highly recommend this wagon.",positive
174,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",MacSports Outdoor Utility Wagon,$59.88 - $222.63,5,"I purchased this to help facilitate a move out of an apartment complex where we had to walk a bit to get to our vehicle. We would not have been able to make it through that move without this. It completely revolutionizes your experience having to move. No more piling your arms sky-high precariously with miscellaneous items, and no more wasting your energy on lugging around smaller things. You need this thing if you're moving on your own.

The wagon folds easily and in a very clever way, very intuitive and convenient. It's easy to carry while folded. It holds quite a bit, we were able to load it up heavily with boxes, plates, and other heavy items without issue.

My only critique is that when it is folded, the smaller set of wheels spins and gets caught on the ground, making it harder to easily maneuver the wagon while folded. Kicking them straight or tugging it more upright generally fixes it, but it was my only complaint.",positive
175,"Patio, Lawn & Garden",MacSports Outdoor Utility Wagon,$59.88 - $222.63,4,"I bought this to use on the beach. It folds nicely, is compact, super easy to open up, super easy to close up, comes with a cover to keep it closed, and handles nicely…until the wheels hit the sand. I used it on New England beaches and it just sank into the sand. I had to lift up the front with the handle and drag it on its rear wheels till I found a spot. Possibly I had too much weight on it, but pulling it along the sidewalk (pavement) was super smooth, easy, nice…it was the sand that made it really tough. I was afraid I was going to pull the handle right out, luckily I didn’t. The cart is great, I can see using it for other reasons, but not for the beach. It would need bigger, fatter tires to go over the sand as nicely as it goes over pavement.",positive

Best part it came assembled. I am up to my neck with putting things together?
The wagon collapse very easy just by pulling up the tag.
As far as maneuverability - it was a little hard to pull in the sand. But I also observed others with wagon had the same challenge.
It started to rain and we were able to easily put everything back in and just 1 trip to the car!
It was sturdy, never worried about it falling over or apart.

Enter, this wagon. Yeah, yeah, it's pink, a color I don't particularly like, but it was the cheapest of all colors and my daughters seem to think it's 'cute' so MAYBE they'll want to pull it once in a while? (Not holding my breath) We took it to an outdoor concert just last night and had to park about a block and a half away. This thing held our camp chairs (pic taken after they were removed and set up) plus our cooler, ground blankets, drinks and extra bags of random crap. It rolled easily, jumped curbs when needed and cruised across the grass of the uneven park like a champ. It will be making many trips to the local parks and swimming (which requires a good half mile walk on gravel park paths) AND I have no doubt this thing will pull it's own weight.

It's built very well, and it folds/unfolds very easily! It's very reliable. I only have two minor critiques. First, I wish there was a wheel lock to keep it in place when you put it away or need to park it on a slope. And second, you cant really roll it while it's in folded form, because the wheels will turn in sideways and just drag and scuff the ground. Still, overall I'm so glad I got this wagon!",positive

I’m on a very fixed income just getting by. I called several bee rescues hoping that they would help me but although there wasn’t a be relocation fee there surely was a bee removal fee. Cheapest I found was $400 here in Miami. This wasn’t an option. I purchased Spectracide hoping it would work. I was so anxious to use it that I didn’t wait until night time for them to all go back to the hive. I almost used an entire bottle and all of the bees just kept flying around. So then I followed the directions with the second bottle and used it at 10 PM. I really didn’t think it worked until the next morning although I could see the bees falling off the hive in a lump sum.
When I open my front door next morning there must’ve been about 500 bees there. Some were dead and some were twitching and others were just walking around. I finished them off with Lysol Disinfecting Spray! Yes Lysol kills roaches and apparently half dead bees as well!

Apply it on top of the soil of your plants. I promise you this WILL remedy fungus gnats.

Also...if your newly re-potted plants have brown spots it can simply be due to overwatering.
If it is a bateria it will have yellow rings around the the brown spots. And I do mean spots (like rain drops), not large browing of leaves. That is caused by over watering.
