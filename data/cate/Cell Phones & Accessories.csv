0,Cell Phones & Accessories,"Ailun Glass Screen Protector Compatible for iPhone 11/iPhone XR, 6.1 Inch 3 Pack Tempered Glass",$7.98,5,"This screen protector is fantastic. There’s no glare, it doesn’t effect touch sensitivity both with your fingerprint recognition and regular touch screen activities. I did not install it myself but my husband did and it went on quickly and easily.

But, the real winning feature is that it works beautifully. I have a medical condition where my hands will become spastic. This condition has ruined many a phone screen for me. I drop them so frequently and often roughly with our meaning too and the screens crack. However, I used one of these for over a year and while I had minimal scratches/cracking of the protector, my phone screen remained completely untouched. Even after the protector had cracked it continued to protect my screen for a great deal of time. I only ordered replacements after I felt like it might be nice not to look at cracks anymore.

Highly recommend this product.",positive
1,Cell Phones & Accessories,"Ailun Glass Screen Protector Compatible for iPhone 11/iPhone XR, 6.1 Inch 3 Pack Tempered Glass",$7.98,5,"I was sent a free iPhone XR to replace my old iPhone when the company turned off 3G in the area. I wasn't to pleased with the beveled edge of the iPhone glass. Had never had a protector over the screen and that worried me. Found this glass protector and thought I would give it a try. I like it. It does protect the screen all the way up to the bevel -- which is much better than nothing. Glass is crystal clear and install is simple, but the cheap alignment stickers that come with the kit are too thin to do any good. So it is basically get the front started up by the camera, don't stick it, just let the corners sit in place and then slowly guide the other end down to it's corners. Worked like a champ (on the 2nd try). The XR screen is notorious for not being perfectly flat, so you may have a bubble that won't go away in a corner where the screen falls off toward the bevel. You'll never notice it using it. The adhesion and clarity and touch preservation were all great. Well forth the protection for the price.",positive

10,Cell Phones & Accessories,"Apple 20W USB-C Power Adapter - iPhone Charger with Fast Charging Capability, Type C Wall Charger",$17.98,4,"When you buy Apple you think you’ll get top quality, safe & effective and you choose to pay the Apple premium for this. Nope on the safe part…. We don’t know what we get with Apple because they simply won’t tell us.

Just before this item I bought an Anker charger only to find in mini print in a mini pkg insert that MAX operating temperature is only 77 degrees for the Anker. SHOCKED it was that low & angry the fact had been hidden in that inset rather than being disclosed on the product page. I was SURE Apple would have a much more reasonable operating temp range.

BUT Apple also did not disclose an operating temp, worse there was nothing even in the product specs insert or on their FAQs online. Couldn’t believe it so I called them & told them this story.

Result: Zero disclosure. In other words, count on your luck because you’re not allowed to know any safe operating temperature guides for use of an Apple charger.

I love my Apple products but this has really shaken me. Never dreamed this could happen with Apple.

Shouldn’t customers be informed on how to safely use products? Isn’t this a requirement? If not why bother with any specs disclosure? Why is temp excluded especially considering 77 degrees is VERY limiting for many people - no AC, no reliable electricity (like Texas), living in tropic or desert climate (100 plus Florida, 115+ Arizona, Cali & many other places if we look only at record summer heat the past 3 summers, even in western Canada!) Not to mention any outdoor living means non-AC heat levels: camping, BBQing, summer parties, even doing a half day road trip can mean high temperatures in the summer even with auto AC on as sun streams inside (personal experience after 6k trip in 2021).

Shameful if you ask me & our government should require ALL safety info is given to consumers including where/what temperature is safe to use a product.",positive

20,Cell Phones & Accessories,"Anker Portable Charger, PowerCore Slim 10000 Power Bank",$21.99 - $27.99,5,"Years ago, my old iphone had that battery issue, where it wouldn't stay charged up as long as a newer phone would have, so I got in the habit of keeping a couple of power banks in my purse to charge on-the-go if needed. A couple of newer phones later, I've stopped relying on the power banks so much, but I still carry them, just in case. The other day, they came in really handy when a friend's phone was nearly dead, and she didn't have a way to charge it. That's when I realized my power banks were really old, and though they still work well, I wonder how much longer they'll last. Surely they'll wear out at some point, right? So I came to Amazon looking for a new one. I wanted to stick with a known brand, and this Anker power bank was low-priced with a coupon, so I grabbed it.

When I took it out of the box and checked it, 2 of the 4 lights were lit up, indicating it was 25%-50% charged, so I plugged it in. But when I checked on it an hour later, it was still only 2 lights. I was concerned that maybe I got a dud, since I expected it to show faster charging progress. But then I saw something in a review or product description that said it takes around 5 hours to fully charge. Plus I realized my biggest old power bank was only 6500mAh, so it makes sense that a 10000mAh would require more time. I then forgot about it till the end of the workday when I was packing up my things to go, and sure enough, it was fully charged.

So far, it's a great little power bank, enough that I can charge up my iPhone 11 a few times before the power bank needs to be recharged. I don't really care that the USB-C is input-only, since most of my devices (and therefore my charging cables) are either micro-USB-C or lighning to USB-A. In fact, I think I only have two cables that are USB-C, so I likely would never use it if that port was available for output...though I certainly understand why other people might wish for that feature. In any case, I've had good luck with the Anker brand, and it looks like this power bank is another winner.",positive
21,Cell Phones & Accessories,"Anker Portable Charger, PowerCore Slim 10000 Power Bank",$21.99 - $27.99,4,"I to replace my Ravpower charger. I wanted the same model which was small, light and had long battery life and fast charge. I was sad to learn Ravpower is no longer sold through Amazon. So I looked at other brands. I like Anker and use them for my wall chargers. I found this model and it fit the bill. It's no frills and about the size of an iPhone. Great for traveling. However, the charger is really heavy compared to the Ravpower. Additionally, it has no protection should it fall to the ground and because it's heavy I can envision it cracking tiles, denting wooden floors and if it falls it may also break the casing. Maybe an optional protective case might be offered at some point? I'd pay a little extra to be able to put some rubber on the corners so when it falls it has a modicum of protection. As for the other parts, the charger charges up pretty quickly so it's ready to use again in less than an hour. The charge life is pretty good too. It fully charges my iPhone 13 in about 20 minutes. I could probably get 2 full charges out of this model before having to recharge the charger. Overall, I'm happy, especially with the price.",positive
22,Cell Phones & Accessories,"Anker Portable Charger, PowerCore Slim 10000 Power Bank",$21.99 - $27.99,5,"I just got done testing how much phone battery I can get from this. I charged my Samsung A51 from 18% to 95% while using the phone heavily (gaming, using apps). Then I charged it again from 14% to 87% (also under heavy use) before the charger ran out of energy. This translates to around 1.5 full battery charges, going from 0% to 100%.

This is absolutely plenty of charge for a full day of heavy phone use. When I bought this I was worried it wouldn't have as much charge as I wanted in case of an emergency. Definitely not worried about that now, and I'm super happy with this purchase.

Other notes: It's lightweight and is about the size of a cell phone. It doesn't show exact charge percentages, but it has 4 small lights, and if all 4 lights are on then the charge is between 75%-100%, 3 lights means the charge is between 50%-75%, etc. This is perfectly fine in my opinion.

Also, this can only charge one phone at a time. If you need to charge multiple phones, or need multiple days of charge, then you'll probably want to go with a different, more heavy-duty charger.",positive
23,Cell Phones & Accessories,"Anker Portable Charger, PowerCore Slim 10000 Power Bank",$21.99 - $27.99,5,"Aside from one huge missed opportunity, this battery is great.
I have had many batteries since long before the Pokemon Go battery revolution.
Now, I have even been on the go and given some away because they were old enough though still working great, but the size now feels clunky.
This battery is slim and perfect for the capacity you enjoy.
The only real negative is that you can't charge USB-C to USB-C...
which might make it feel slightly dated. But it charges very well (so far.)
at least I still have tons of cables that work with this. though I mostly stick to cables that are USB-A to USB-C. There no wireless charging but I already knew that going in.",positive
24,Cell Phones & Accessories,"Anker Portable Charger, PowerCore Slim 10000 Power Bank",$21.99 - $27.99,5,"I bought this a few months ago as 'emergency backup', if I happened to be away from a charging source (so, not in a building or car; generally for camping and the like). The battery in my Galaxy S8 has degraded over time, and I wasn't ready to get spendy on a new phone, nor did I look forward to 'cell phone surgery' to replace the battery (the days of popping off the case back and swapping out in a minute or two are long gone, sad to say). So I ordered this up. At 10,000 mAh, I figured I should get enough charge to get me through a jam.

If you're thinking... ""S8! That's a dinosaur!"" -- you're likely rocking something much more current, and aren't worried about off-grid power. Yet. But remember -- all batteries degrade with time.

After having used it... my thoughts
- Takes a bit to charge up, once discharged (so once you've discharged, plan ahead). Especially the first time.

- However, once it's charged up, the self-discharge rate is slow, so you don't have to constantly keep it plugged into a wall wart, etc. You can charge this up, once conditioned, and pack it away for a few weeks to a few months.

- The 4 LED meters on the front are handy for determining SoC / Time to Charge

- Form factor on this is very similar to the dimensions on my S8 (although a little thicker, and of course, heavier)

- A shorter USB A <> USB-C cable does double duty -- USB A to bring the charge to the phone / device via USB-C, then remove & flip USB-C into the input of the Anker, while plugging the 'A' end into any compatible port to recharge it.

- Comes with a black cloth bag with drawstring closure, which is nice to keep that short USB cable together with the device. Nothing fancy, but useful.

- And probably the best, after using Qi-Wireless for 90% of the time over the life of the G8 -- this thing puts juice into the phone, quickly. I can go from 5-15% charge to 30% in under 30min. Not sure how many amps it's charging at (rated at 'up to 12' -?), but it's definitely quick. If you're caught somewhere without power (or even if you're not) -- this device is a lifesaver (figuratively & perhaps literally, I guess).

Technically, I guess you're not supposed to use the phone while charging with a power bank, but it comes in handy for those times where you need to use the phone a little longer, but need a little juice to tide you over (it juices the phone so fast--especially vs. Qi-wireless--that you say ""I might as well just keep it hooked up to this)). I think it'll charge close to 100% in about 90 minutes, maybe less.

- Since my G8 battery is ~ 3800 mAh (?), I can get up to two full charges out of this thing, or many 'partial' charges. From full, 30 minutes' time on the G8 doesn't even remove one 'dot' from the 4-light meter. This is real value, in my book. Because most of the time, I can get back to a power source in 30min or so.

So... for what I'm using it for, which is to buy time until I decide to finally (!) upgrade my phone, and keep the S8 running a little while longer... it's an excellent accessory, from a trusted company. Since this has been out a while, and been superseded by higher-cap devices, solar-capable chargers, etc. -- it's also cheap -- about the cost of one of those replacement battery kits (with batteries that came from who knows where).

Not often I unequivocally give the full 5-stars... but this product gets them from me. Recommended.
(oh, and mine came new in a box, so if yours doesn't... get in touch with Anker for a new replacement)",positive
25,Cell Phones & Accessories,"Anker Portable Charger, PowerCore Slim 10000 Power Bank",$21.99 - $27.99,4,"The first thing I do when I buy from Amazon is look at the negative reviews of the product. I can say that, in my experience, the negative reviews are very wrong for this product. The big issue that I've seen is that you can't charge your device from the ""type-c"" port... not only does it say that on the description, it also says it on the device. As far as charging goes, I have a Samsung galaxy a525g. I get, bottom to top, 3 charges on this battery pack. That's not frickin bad. I thought I would only get 2 full charges but I got 3. I also run a usb fan. On low power with the fan, it lasted almost 9 hours. With a usb light, it lasted over 16 hours of CONSTANT use. In my opinion, this battery pack is well worth the money. And as of now (8/4/22) they have it on sale AND an 30%off coupon. You'd be a fool not to get one. I just got 2 more.",positive

They work great, charge fast, and always charge more times than I was originally expecting. They are very company, and fit well into any backpack, fanny pack, or medium purse.

My reason for 4/5 stars is that there are two inputs for charging the pack USB C and Micro USB, but there is NO USB C output. This was clearly stated in the product's description, and I saw it when I ordered, but in practicality it is much more inconvenient than I originally envisioned.",positive

A while back I got a 10,000 mAh power bank that was made by Poweradd. It was smaller, thinner and more compact than this one. I'd hoped to get another one of those because it was perfect to carry around in a pants pocket.

30,Cell Phones & Accessories,"Ailun 2 Pack Screen Protector for iPhone 13 Pro Max [6.7 inch] Display 2021 with 2 Pack Tempered Glass Camera Lens Protector,[9H Hardness]-HD Case Friendly",$8.98,5,"The easiest installs are the ones where you have all the tools you need in front of you & not ones you have to scrounge and re-purpose for the sake of winging it with the hopes that you can pull it all together. I was pretty pleased with this product. After my bf accidentally dropped his new iPhone 13 pro max I thought it would be good to invest in some protective gear for his phone and saw this one for sale.

So this has two sets of lens protectors for both the front of your phone and for the camera lenses in the back. I haven’t really seen much in the way of bundles or products that sell both together so this was a good find, especially on a discount. The tools are all there for you and you get 4 sets of wet & dry wipes (not two, which is nice to have extra cleaning supplies), plus a sticker to pull off any bits of dust that come into contact on your phone after extensive wiping and cleaning because that shit is unavoidable unless you are working in a sanitized vacuum. There’s a little instruction sheet (make sure you unfold it so that you can see ALL of the instructions) which also helps show you the steps to efficiently install your screen & lens protector.

The best part: both front and back protectors work. I tested the camera app after putting on the camera lens protector and there were no issues with taking pictures. Make sure you ALIGN the camera lens protector to all three of your camera lenses. A slight offfset will affect your camera & block the side views, plus you’ll need to be weary of cleaning off any residual adhesive really well if you end up having to redo and shift your lens protector over to its right spot.

Get this product to protect your 13 pro max. Or don’t if you don’t do well with reading instructions and are too impetuous with laying out all of your materials first to get an overall understanding of how everything works before accidentally slapping on something and skipping a step and this is of course without any helping meticulous hands. I’m essentially describing and teasing my bf here, which is why I ended up buying & doing all of the install work for him.",positive

Other plus is it came with 2 rear camera protectors as well.

I would say beware, if you like an Otterbox design case like myself. If you do not line it up perfect to not pinch on enclosing it in the case. It will cause a small air pocket.

I strongly recommend that you take a look at this Glass Screen Protector for your current phone or when you buy a new phone. You will be amazed at the quality of this item!!

Idk if it's just my case, but the camera covers stick out just as much as the phone case giving the back a flushed look.",positive

But these worked great! Well, the black one, as I didn't get to test the other one. Bought them for my trip to Colombia and used it in the ocean/salt water/big waves and in the pool/chlorine water. I had stuffed a card and some cash too besides the phone. It all fit and stayed dry. Just make sure for the purpose of picture taking that if you put something else in to place it so it doesn't cover the camera. I also used it almost daily on land too, as a hidden wallet kind of thing. I would put some cash and a card in, and put it under the t-shirt or dress I was wearing. So like that if I was to find myself in a situation that my purse was stolen or lost, I'd still have $ to get back to hotel.
I also told my boss to get it for her vacation, and it was perfect because she went with her husband and this comes in 2. Get it, do the napkin in + place in sink test first, then if it came without defects just wipe it dry again and you're good to go.",positive

The seal kept the water out and my phone dry!
Face recognition and touch screen works no problem. I did have some trouble with video however,...it would not allow me to press the record button while I was underwater: I eventually figured out that if I pressed the record button Outside the water and THEN submerged the phone while it was already recording, I could get video no problem. Not sure what that was about but we purchased 4 of these and it was the same with all 4. Taking regular pictures underwater was no problem,...it was only recording video underwater that we had trouble with. I did notice that after a while in the case the air inside the case would expand & puff up. Every once and a while we'd have to open the case and release the trapped air because it would become harder to have contact with the buttons on the phone. We also used these on our zip lining trip and it was convenient to have hanging on our necks to take quick pics and not fuss with taking it in or out of a Fanny pack or pocket. Getting the phone out of the case was another story! It's in there tight so you really need to wiggle and manipulate it out of the case several times I was worried I'd rip the case All in all this was a great purchase for the price and my family enjoyed our Hawaii vacation and took lots of amazing pictures both in and out of the water!",positive

Bought these for my kids to take on a water rafting trip. Their phones fit nicely inside with some room to spare and sealed water tight. There was swimming, splashing and few tip overs and there was no damage to either phone. It allowed for my kids to be able to take pictures without worrying about damaging their phones. They wore them around their neck and I was concerned that if there was a major tip over that they may lose their phones if the lanyard slipped off. I had them weave the lanyard through their life vests straps just in case and that seemed to secure them. My only wish is that there would be an option to clip the lanyard to your clothing, bag, or life vest. In a case of water rapids that might tip a person over, the lanyard might come off from around the neck if not secured by another mean.
That was just a suggestion and by no means plays a factor in my rating. They worked for what we needed and I would recommend them to anyone.",positive

(For the record, we both use Samsung s21 ultras and they fit snugly)
The pros:
-the phone works great through the plastic (even fingerprint scanner)
-pictured come out clearly
-the seal is watertight (I used it a few times to make a videos underwater, no water ever got in)
-the phone still works well even if there are water droplets on the plastic, so your phone won't act up like it would if a raindrop touched it.
-the neckband is large enough that you can use it while it hanging around your neck
The cons:
The neck strap often slides and doesn't stay locked at the length you want.

Overall these thing are useful for more than just the pool. I play Pokemon Go, and this thing allows me to play in the rain. I would recommend them for any outdoor sporting events or concerts. Heck they would even be good for anyone that like their phone in the shower or bath.",positive

The only drawback to them, is that your phone can and most like will (especially if exposed to the sun and/or on a hot day, overheat. Our iPhones all did, and apparently (we didn’t know this before that day), iPhones have a safety feature which prevents further use if/when they reach a certain temperature.

Now I must admit that we also had our regular protective cases on them as well (which while not otterbox bulky, still easily fit within these cases), so that probably contributed to the built up heat level. But we felt that given the rough nature of the rocks and banging around while tubing down a shallow river, it was best to have as much physical protection as possible!

Being completely waterproof however, we were easily able to keep them cooled down by simply letting them sit 98% submerged in the cool water between uses.

They are definitely a necessary and worthwhile purchase!",positive

I snorkel at the beach, not out at the reefs. I first tested this case by putting a paper towel in it and weighting it down in the sink at home for about 1/2 hour. No seepage. None in my husband's case either. On our Florida trip, I used it with my Iphone 12 in it and my husband on land with his Iphone 6. Mine took beautiful clear photos underwater, and initially I was having no problems with the touch screen in the case. It worked well when out of the water. In fact, the case and neck cord are particularly helpful when you are taking the glass bottom boat ride at John Pennakamp State Park, Key Largo, FL because you can't drop your phone in the water when using it, and it is protected from spray when you are at the bow of the boat going out to where the viewing area is. I easily added my driver's license and credit card to the case (making sure they were below the camera lens) and my mind was safely at ease that my valuables were protected. One difficulty is that- when you are actually in the water at a beach, and the sun is out, the reflection makes it hard to view the phone screen selections (even without the waterproof case)+ the added water drops on the outside of the case. My phone got warmer, as I was in the water for about 45 minutes each state park we visited, and the case started ""fogging"" inside, as the water was cool-furthering the difficulty of seeing the phone screen clearly while you are trying to take photos either in or out of the water. When I was taking photos under the water, I couldn't clearly see the phone screen due to the fogging and found later that many of my underwater photos somehow went to video...and the videos were very short; almost ""snaps"" of the activity I was trying to capture. Because of the wave activity, and standing in the water using the snorkel instead of floating (because I was afraid of drifting out over my head), I was buffeted about + my feet in the bottom silt would cloud the water as I was off balance. So when I saw a school of fish, I just tried, without focusing, to keep rapidly hitting the shutter button to capture as much as I could of the action below me. Obviously, sometimes I wasn't hitting the shutter, but either sliding to video or whatever. Quite a few of my intended to be video videos had the notation ""unsupported"" when I loaded them to my pc at home. I must have blindly hit something else??? Very disappointing. Some of the intended still photos came out ""EA-xxxx"". All of this must be operator error, as the touch and slide worked beautifully through the case when dry on the outside and taking photos out of the water environment. I did have a great time using the case, and took videos and stills that I never could have taken without this case, so I would recommend it....just be aware of what could happen in the hands of someone like me. I don't use face recognition. When the camera was warm, it was difficult immediately removing the I-phone from the case without danger of splitting the case seams near the opening, but in a few minutes the problem dissipated as the phone cooled and the fogginess left the case. I am posting a still shot of some type of lobster with a forked tail which ran across my foot and then hid under a rock, Bahia Honda State Park, Big Pine Key, FL and a video of fish at Fort Zach State Park in Key West, FL. I had silted up the water with my feet, so not an issue with the case. The fish at Bahia Honda around the beach tend to be brown, while the ones farther south at Fort Zach beach in Key West were colorful and only a couple of yards out. The birds were taken using the case on dry land at John Pennakamp.",positive

Face recognition is not as without the case but over all still a great buy if you are going to be around water. Price was great for 2! Only suggestion I saw on another product is floating ability.

50,Cell Phones & Accessories,"Smiling Case with Tempered Glass Screen Protector Compatible with Apple Watch Series 7/6/se/5/4, Ultra-Thin Scratch Resistant Overall Protective Cover for iWatch",$8.86 - $10.05,5,"The Apple Watch is a clever piece of technology, but ""wearable tech"" runs the risk of bangs and bashes as happens in peoples lives so we added the ""Smiling"" screen protector. The ""Smiling"" screen protector snaps tightly over the face of the watch but is easily removed when the watch and protector need to be cleaned.

Periodically, the screen protector needs to be removed from the watch to clean all the surfaces front and back. The last time we removed the screen protector for a cleaning we discovered the screen protector was cracked, meaning it took a hit or a passing blow from something. The wearer of the Apple Watch did not even notice that her watch had taken some kind of a beating, and fortunately the protector did what it was supposed to do and protected the watches' screen from damage.

We then installed the second screen protector (they come with two protectors in a package) and we then ordered another pair of replacement screen protectors so we always have some on hand - they seem to work pretty well and are adding an important layer of protection to the Apple Watch screen.

Adding the layer of tempered glass does not impede the touch screen (or stylus tap) on the watch, and aside from the occasional humidity build-up between the screen protector and the watch screen (removed with a quick wipe with a paper towel or tissue) adding the screen protector is invisible and unnoticeable. These screen protectors are expensive for what they are, but certainly much less expensive than a screen repair done by Apple.",positive

It is dented in and wont give that appropriate click when I push it. it still works and I can slightly push it and will do what its supposed to do but its still not the same. I have a warranty on the watch still so I will be able to replace it or fix it when I feel like it but if this happens to folks that don't have warranty on it, they sure are going to be disappointed.

The watch face was still functional but was cracked and probably not as waterproof anymore and sharp in a few spots. Replacement of the glass by Apple was actually sixteen dollars more than a new watch, so that was a big NO from me. I figured a screen cover would work until I was ready to buy a new watch and this case fit the bill nicely. It snaps on tight, works flawlessly for touchscreen, and even disguises some of the damage, buying me some time until I'm ready to fork over for a new watch. The only problem I have with it is that my nightstand charging stand is a millimeter off from centering the watch when charging with this case and I have to remove it each time I want to use that particular charging platform. I plan on altering the charging stand with a file to remove some excess material, but you should know that you MIGHT have problems with some charging stands.

I used it for a little while and couldn't get past the uneven look on the screen.

So this time, I spent 2x as much and purchased a hard cover case, thinking that glass will not yellow.

I love that it comes with a few screen protectors in the box, the second I put the last screen in the box on my phone I made sure to order another box. These screen protectors are strong and last a long time and don’t move around at all once you’re done working on your phone. They are SO EASY to put on!! Other brands can be difficult to put on and extremely hard to get air bubbles out. With this brand all you do is gently lay it down on your phone and then tap the middle of the screen, and if you look closely you’ll see it slowly bonding or attaching to your phone’s screen. So easy! Just make sure before putting it on to use the included cleaning stuff that comes with it, and even if you don’t see anything on your phone after drying it, use the stickers to pick up any lint. I missed a tiny piece of something and it left a tiny air bubble but it was easy to use my thumb to press and move the little bubble out. Also make sure you try to aim or line things perfectly so it’s not crooked. If it’s a little off though you won’t really notice once you put your phone case back on. Another thing that I really really love about this brand is that it doesn’t leave fingerprints (unless you just put lotion on your hands or ate something greasy with your hands) and it doesn’t look streaky or filmy like other plastic flimsy protectors. Unless for some dumb reason they discontinue or stop making this product, I will forever be buying this. It’s even better than the screen protector that the T-Mobile guy put on my phone when I first bought my phone.

The bumper style protector did not protect the watch face and I got a few scratches as result. I added a film scratch protector and it peeled off within days. I initially resisted buying this model thinking it would be too bulky, but it was a choice I now regret. It turns out that it adds a minimal 1mm to the profile of the watch and had I gotten this one first there would be no scratches on my watch’s face.

The protector is not waterproof in the sense that water will seep in between it and the watch if submerged. That’s no big deal. The protector is easy to remove, dry and reattach. It can be done in a matter of seconds.

I bought this protector in October 2021 and only this week did I finally have to replace it with the 2nd of the two that come in the box. I banged my watch really hard causing the edge of the protector to crack, but it did its job and the watch was fine. I intend to keep my watch for as long as possible. So, today I bought another set of these to have on hand a year from now if the one I just put on needs to be replaced. Until Apple figures out how to use traditional sapphire (or something else as hard) for their watch faces, save yourself some grief and get this protector, it’s the best one I’ve found.",positive

I’ve had my watch for a year and it’s in perfect condition. Granted, I’m not going spelunking every day or climbing Everest with it or anything, but I’m not exactly easy on the watch either. For a few dollars, this case can’t be beat. It’s low profile, looks good and most importantly does an excellent job protecting the watch. I’ve gone through a few of the cases and never had the glass of the case break. Sometimes a strap of a backpack or something will catch it and it can pop off and get lost but that’s the only reason I’ve had to replace it. And, for just a few dollars, it’s not a big deal at all to replace it. It doesn’t happen very often and I always have an extra in a drawer. Just pop a new one on and good to go.",positive

I came on here to see if anyone else had the same issue and found this brand and the review that talked about it not affecting the touchscreen like others sold me so bought it and returned the other.

It is perfect. It works flawlessly, unlike the other brand. It works as if there isn't even a cover on the watch itself and I'd be hard pressed to tell I have a cover on my Apple Watch because it acts as if there's nothing there with the touchscreen.

I have the Apple Watch SE and it's a perfect fit. Do not hesitate to buy this one, you won't be disappointed and it will save you a purchase and return on any others that just won't work as well.",positive

Also they last you a very long time, I bought my first pair a year ago and the first one lasted me the whole time, which I replaced after it had a big scratch which otherwise would have been on my watch instead.

I've already cracked both cases just being careless and dropping my watch, and the case has perfectly protected the screen each time.

What I like most about this case is how easy it is to remove! I was worried the case might use some kind of adhesive like other screen protectors, but the case just snaps on top of the watch body. It's true, the main drawback of the case is it isn't waterproof, but when it gets wet all you have to do is pop the case off, dry it off with a towel, and put it back on. Admittedly, it's a little inconvenient, but for the amount of times its saved my watch, I think it's worth it. Would 100% recommend this over the stick-on screen protectors.",positive
75,Cell Phones & Accessories,Misxi 2 Pack Hard PC Case with Tempered Glass Screen Protector Compatible with Apple Watch Series 6 SE Series 5 Series 4,$10.99 - $11.99,4,"These protectors snap on tightly and do the job you purchased them for. For awhile. Depending on how active you are and what chores and labors you're doing these protectors will take the hits you don't want your watch to take. But I think at any average activity level, you should expect to buy at least a couple 2-packs over the course of a year. They're not necessarily fragile, per se, but over the course of several good hits will start to loosen and then eventually crack.
If your chore or activity involves water (doing the dishes, gardening, swimming, etc.) water WILL get between the protector and the watch and interfere with touch functions. (In fact, I learned this is one of the reasons Apple officially doesn't want you to use protectors like these because especially with activities like swimming, they trap water and moisture longer than the watch is designed for.) I don't swim with mine but when I do trap water or moisture I've learned that removing and replacing the protector several times to wipe everything down weakens it and makes it susceptible to cracking.
Otherwise, the good news is these fit snuggly without interfering with the aesthetics of the watch, don't yellow and have, at least in my case, protected my watch face 100% from cracks and scratches.",positive
76,Cell Phones & Accessories,Misxi 2 Pack Hard PC Case with Tempered Glass Screen Protector Compatible with Apple Watch Series 6 SE Series 5 Series 4,$10.99 - $11.99,4,"I think this case will hold up well over time and protect the watch well. It was pretty easy to snap on, though it’s a little difficult to snap it off. Usually this wouldn’t be a concern, but it could be if you use your watch during workouts and sweat. The sweat has a tendency to get trapped between the plastic case and watch face. If you don’t remove the case and dry it off every time, I would be concerned what the accumulation of sweat might do to the watch when it’s trapped. For that reason alone, I am giving this 4 stars. Essentially, I am not going to be able to use this and will rely on simple screen protectors instead.",positive

1. they're really easy to install — just clip it on and it stays on firmly
2. this makes it really easy to take them on and off without having to take off the watch and removing the bands — something I need to do often before I go swimming
3. the material feels like it can actually resist scratches — it has done well on short drops
4. the trim colors are good looking and metallic. If you scratch your watch, the color is the first thing that flakes off but no complaints since it protects the watch.
5. the touch screen sensitivity is great! did not realize how frustrated I'd grown with the repeat taps I'd have to do with the other ones that still wouldn't register.

80,Cell Phones & Accessories,"2-Pack Miady 10000mAh Dual USB Portable Charger, Fast Charging Power Bank with USB C Input, Backup Charger for iPhone X, Galaxy S9, Pixel 3 and etc …",$21.99 - $27.99,5,"After having read some of the negative reviews, I was a little skeptical about ordering this. However, I am very pleased with the product. I have not been paid nor received products to write this review. I don't write many reviews, but when I do, I try to do an in-depth evaluation of them. In my testing, I used my iPhone XS, iPad 6th Gen, my Kindle Fire 8 inch, and my wife's iPad Air 4.

About the battery. It's not very clear from the website or the instructions on what the ports do, but the information is there. It would be better if the company printed INPUT or OUTPUT on the battery itself. To summarize, this device has 2 INPUT ports (to charge the battery pack), a micro-USB and a USB-C port. The USB-C cannot be used to power a device. To test this, I plugged a USB-C cable into my wife's iPad Air 4, and the iPad started charging the portable charger. The 2 USB-A ports are what are used for charging devices. Charging times will vary depending on if you are using the device while charging or charging with it off. Some reviews said it will only charge their device once. It's important to note, this is only a 10,000 mAh battery. My iPad Air has 8800 mAh battery. The battery pack has only an 80% efficiency rate (no batteries are 100% efficient) so you will only get about 8000 mAh from it meaning it will charge my device only once. It will charge my phone almost 3 times however. For tablets, if you want to charge more than once, then a larger capacity battery is needed.

To properly use a battery pack, let you device run down some, to approx 50-80% before using the charger. IF you fully deplete the device, it may not be able to power the dive and charge it at the same time. Now for the tests on each device:

Apple iPhone XS
It charges my iPhone while using. It charged 1% in about 10 minutes. While the phone was off, it charged 10% in under an hour, but my phone was at 88%, so it was near a full charge. It would charger quicker if it had a lower charge.

Apple iPad 6th Gen
This charged my iPad while using it. It is not fast, but it will provide a slight charge while using. While off, I gained 30% from 36% to 66% in 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Apple iPad Air 4
Apple's new iPad with a high resolution screen and fast 8 core processor for CPU and graphics, the battery will only hold a charge, this portable charger will not charge the iPad while using it. While off, it charged the battery 10% in an hour and 15 minutes. It is important to note, you will have to get a USB-A to USB-C cable to charge newer generation iPads. If you plug the Apple cable with 2 USB-C ports into the USB-C port on the battery pack, the iPad will charge the battery pack.

Kindle Fire 8 Inch
The device charges while using. Due to its smaller battery capacity, it charged about 10% in 15 minutes.

As mentioned before, this is great value for a battery pack for smaller devices. It will power tablets as well, but for devices with large capacity batteries, it will be very slow, and only provide one charge. I've only had the device 1 week, time will see how well they hold up.",positive

We had no issues with TSA in 4 continents/countries (USA, Italy, Egypt, and Jerusalem). We simply put the chargers in our checked bags, as the airports require.

They worked perfectly because I could keep the charger closed in my purse while the cord was attached to my phone in my hand, still taking pics. The chargers are about the size of a cellphone, themselves. So, not too bulky or awkward to fit in a pocket or purse. We used these while out all day roaming (data), taking pictures, and using Snapchat. We never ran out of battery.

The initial charge of the battery bank takes a few hours, but it’s much less time to top off. Charging your phone, it’s about 30 minutes for the first 50%, as advertised. We didn’t time it 0 to 100% as we never let it get that low. We had no problems topping off throughout the day, and never ran out of juice. I liked that this came with two since it charges 1 device faster, but we got by fine using one the days when my husband forgot his.

Overall, I definitely recommend if you will be out and about using your phone all day. If you bring it in your flight carry-on, it may be confiscated in some countries/airports. Checked bag should be perfectly fine!",positive

90,Cell Phones & Accessories,"Ailun 2 Pack Screen Protector Compatible for iPhone 13 [6.1 inch Display]with 2 Pack Tempered Glass Camera Lens Protector,[9H Hardness]-HD",$8.88,5,"To be honest, I really loved both the adhesion and image quality. But, at the same time, without an alignment tool / guide, it frankly, at least for first timers around such as myself, anyway, can find it rather challenging / tricky. Now, I’ve applied screen protectors before, but the thing is, the last two times I did, it was for my previous iPhone, which I had an alignment tool. That’s the downside of this: it doesn’t have one supplied. However, I must say, the good really seems to outweigh the bad here, as they even offer a full refund/replacement service, including & even if you installed it wrong or ended up with *any* bubbles, dust, or lint, for example. Having said that, friendly customer service is always a “plus” in my book and surely can go a long way, as that’s what keeps them coming back.

Anyway, I haven’t really installed it as accurately as I possibly could, but then, that was my first try, so as I said, it can potentially be tricky, especially on the first shot. Wasn’t that bad though, just slightly misaligned but good for the most part, which is why I didn’t take it off or at least not just yet requested a replacement (though I was quite frustrated at the time it was applied). Then again, the alignment was just a little off, & the adhesion was *almost* perfect (just one small bubble on the bottom right hand corner of the screen). I’ll see if I can deal and live with it, I think I can. The main thing though is that, even though it turned out to be just slightly slanted, & a bit higher than I wanted it to be, the whole screen is still covered, and the front-facing camera has no blockage or interference either. Add to that the fact that there’s barely any dust underneath and that the lens protector additionally was applied real well, I am really glad with my purchase regardless, as the good outweighs the bad, pretty much. Of course though, if I feel the need to, I can always contact customer service for a refund or replacement, as I feel is needed. Just remember to take your time with this and watch the tutorial video… I’d say I still did pretty well for my first try, first time around.

Btw, my cousin referred me to this product as he has one himself, and I was convinced that it would be the perfect (or almost perfect) choice. Basically as good as it gets. I’d look no further: this is *probably* as good and reliable a screen protector can get for your iPhone: it’s an industry leader in technology across the globe which just so happens to have so many customers worldwide. Only downside of course if any, really, is that there’s no alignment tool. But keep in mind the fact that sometimes alignment tools can be unreliable and mess up the outcome of application(s) when it comes down to applying screen protectors in *some cases*, which my cousin also mentioned to me that a friend or relative of his used a screen protector but actually had trouble using the alignment tool (obviously for another product which falls under the same genre / category). But, otherwise, I’d say go for it. Once again, as I said earlier, the good greatly outweighs the bad when it comes to this particular product.

So, good luck and enjoy this great product. And remember the 100% Money Back/Replacement Guarantee, should anything fail or fall short, EVEN IF IT’S A MISTAKE YOU MADE. IT’S OK I’m sure they’ll uphold their end of the deal. Have a good one, and please get this product (or another screen protector) from this same brand depending on which iPhone model you have. I’m confident you won’t regret it. All you have to do is contact them, and you should be good.

P.S. The great pricing, quality of the product, & Money Back Replacement Guarantee seems to make this a no-brainer: both the deal you get & the integrity of the product are unmatched, so if you have a smartphone (iPhone or Android device) and you don’t have a screen protector yet, GET IT! Get it NOW! I promise you won’t be disappointed. Have a nice day!",positive
91,Cell Phones & Accessories,"Ailun 2 Pack Screen Protector Compatible for iPhone 13 [6.1 inch Display]with 2 Pack Tempered Glass Camera Lens Protector,[9H Hardness]-HD",$8.88,5,"BACKGROUND: I love my Apple products but what I like the most is being able to show the pretty pink color (I have an iPhone 13). You can’t really do that with a iPhone case. After being repeatedly told by my friends/family that I must be super brave to walk around without an iPhone case and to at least get a screen protector, I eventually caved so here I am. I bought this to try it out. It came with 2 sets of protectors for the front screen and the camera on the back.

APPLICATION: It wasn’t too difficult to apply. I have a steady hand so that was useful to make sure the screen wasn’t crooked. You are given a wet wipe and a dry wipe to use prior to applying the screen. Then, there are these little sticker tabs that you can use to help position the screen in the desired place. I ended up just using a combination of the sticky tabs and then also grabbing the edge of the screen with my fingers to place the screen. I also washed my hands prior to even attempting this.

FIT: Once applied, it fit perfectly fine on my iPhone 13 (both the front screen protector and the back camera protector).

DURABILITY: I wasn’t as invincible as I thought since I ended up accidentally dropping my phone a couple different times. The first time, I saw crack marks on the back camera. Then after dropping my phone again, I had a large crack mark on the front screen. A huge sigh of relief though when I removed the screens and found no damage whatsoever to the phone camera or to the front screen. The protectors did their job and took the damage so that all I had to do was remove them.

REMOVAL: The protectors didn’t leave any weird residue or anything on the phone. After removing the 1st set of protectors, I just thoroughly cleaned my phone with the provided wet wipe and dry wipe. Then, I proceeded with applying the 2nd protector set using the same technique as described above.

RECOMMENDATION: Overall, these screen protectors did the job they are intended to do. I would definitely recommend.",positive

They've protected my phone from face down landings many times. This time I opted to get the pack with the camera protector as well. The screen protector adhered to my phone with no problems and all air bubbles pushed themselves out in 5 seconds (TIP: HOLD THE PROTECTOR BY THE EDGES AND CAREFULLY DROP IT ONTO YOUR PHONE'S SCREEN. AIR BUBBLES FORM WHEN YOU TRY TO STICK ONE AREA OF THE PROTECTOR BEFORE THE OTHERS, SO IT'S BEST TO DROP IT SO THAT THE ENTIRE PIECE STICKS AT ONCE). So, the screen protector is perfect. BUT, the camera protector is questionable in my opinion. It has a lot of glue, which I'm concerned will either form residue on my $1000 phone, or eventually cause interference with the lenses. The phone also looks pretty nerdy with it on, like you can tell it's there unlike the screen protector. I also took several photos with and without the lens protector and there was a noticeable difference in picture quality. I think if you have a decent case, the camera protection isn't necessary. And if you're an iPhotographer, you're going to be missing out on quality you could be getting.

If you have shaky hands it can be tough.

Otherwise, if you got it right then there’s no bubbles whatsoever, you let the screen fall on, press it in the middle and satisfyingly watch the air go to the edges of your phone.

I purchased these for my brothers iPhone 13 and the privacy screen protectors for my iPhone 13 mini. The privacy ones work just as advertised! Both fit perfectly and give enough space on the edges for a protector to go on. Some dust buildup over time might occur but I’ve had my precious protector on for about half a year and it wasn’t terrible.

Anyway, look at how clear it went on! I am very happy with my purchase and if it’s durable and protects accidental falls well then I will definitely purchase more!

Edit: forgot to mention I also did install the camera protectors and they did not affect the quality whatsoever! I remember trying to put camera protectors on my Note 20, and the camera would always end up taking bad blurry pictures. Not on this one though.

100,Cell Phones & Accessories,"Ailun Glass Screen Protector Compatible for iPhone 13/13 Pro [6.1 Inch] Display 3 Pack Tempered Glass,Case Friendly",$7.89,5,"I would rate this screen protector 10 stars if I could. My phone recently took a major fall and landed on a metal bracket (thanks almost 100 lb dog who pulled me in the other direction suddenly and sent my phone flying), and of course, there was a ginormous crack. I was certain the crack made it to my actual phone because other protectors I had, if the fall was this big of an impact, would make it through. My phone was just a month old, too!
After staring at the crack for another month, I finally figured it was time to fix the screen. I almost went to make the appointment but figured I’d check for the off chance it was just the protector, although surely it was also my actual screen due to major impact and crack.
Low and behold! It was just the screen protector! My phone’s screen is spotless.
This product is amazing. If you’re doing searches and can’t settle on which one to get, just get this one and move on with your life.

The key is to take your time plotting where you are going to install the mount, before peeling back the adhesive. I try to find the optimal location where the phone does not hinder my driveline site, yet is a quick glance away. I make sure that the edge of the bottom bracket is lightly touching the dashboard so as to ease the pressure on the mount. I flex the mount in every direction to make sure my iPhone can easily get in and out.

The 1st one I had years ago was great with unbeatable suction for the dashboard just fine, but I accidently broke the suction bar because it was difficult to remember for sure which direction it meant to move; thus, I've been on the journey of finding a replacement for many years. I've tried a bunch of the ones where supposedly you could attach to the vents.... well, maybe, but definitely not the 2004 model. The vents are so loose that they couldn't hold the weight of any cell phones prob not even the Samsung mini flip phone. Fast forward to this product, I tried using the suction way on the windshield so I didn't have to put it on the dashboard... well, it didn't last overnight. I was about to return it then I finally tried the sticker suction way on the dashboard. I was trying to avoid this version since it's more permanent than the windshield, but at least it worked and stayed on without any problems for about a month or so now.

Other models of phone holders will either not stay mounted to the dash, or they will not hold my large model phones that will always be wrapped with a protective case. This iOttie, of which I have had two, has always stayed solidly mounted where I have installed it. It has been able to hold the weight of the phone with the case (S21 Ultra + Otterbox), and the attaching mechanism has never failed even after many months of daily use. The previous one lasted for several years.

The other nice attribute is the ability of this device to move in so many directions in order to place the phone in the position I need it in. The dash on my truck is a bit odd and I don't like my phone in my line of sight. I was able to create a way for my phone to be placed lower and still have rigidity. I've been very happy with iOttie products. I generally purchase the more simple models. I don't need the more complex ones. However, I am sure they would be very well made.",positive

I bought this one after my old mount would lose suction and fall off if the weather was too hot or too cold, oftentimes it would fall when I was driving, and that was very dangerous.

The mount by iOttie has been stuck to my windshield for 10 months now and stayed on during sub freezing days and days where the temperature reached well over 100!

The spring loaded clamp is so hassle free and holds your device in place, and no need to squeeze the sides because it automatically clamps down on your phone when you push it against the back of the holder!

I work on a construction site where huge bumps and potholes are very frequent and this thing never shakes lose and keeps my phone secured.

I have an iPhone 13 pro max and it fits perfectly.

Get rid of those janky holders where you have to contort and bend the support arm just to get it in the right position. Keep it sweet and simple.

One little issue that I wasn't very bothered by was that the dash mount didn't work for me. But this is largely because of the way my dashboard is. If you're looking for this to mount on your dash just make sure your dash is flat enough and not made of a slick material.

Other than that this mount is perfect!

I put it above the touch screen radio and it has to block my screen a little bit, but it's better than blocking my view of the road. The most important thing for me was to be able to clearly see the road because my phone mount before blocked the road and it was so scary to drive with.
I love that I can use one hand to put my phone in and take it out. My phone is very secure and never falls out. I also like that I can adjust the arm and the angle.

127,Cell Phones & Accessories,iOttie Easy One Touch Dashboard & Windshield Universal Car Mount Phone Holder Desk Stand,$16.99 - $24.99,5,"Background info:
I bought the Easy One Touch 4 in the fall of 2018 because of its features and price. I still use the original because it still works and nothing ground-breaking has come out--all it needs to do is hold a phone. The only problem I had with the Easy One Touch 4 was the adhesive coming off after a few months, but I was able to get a replacement [via RMA] in a few days. I've bought the Easy One Touch 4 several more times for family and friends based on the price/performance ratio and the after sale support. I wanted to see if the Easy One Touch 5 had made any major improvements, so I went ahead and ordered it.

Packaging:
The packaging is roughly the same, although the sizing chart had been removed and the stock image now shows the mount being used in a ""luxury"" vehicle; this tells me that the company is trying to move upstream [which is fine], but outside of Lyft/Uber, I don't think most people would use a phone mount if their car already has
infotainment/GPS built in. The packaging does look nicer and the color palette remains the same. The font has also appeared to change, but I doubt anyone cares much about the packaging except for environmentally conscientious individuals. Every component inside receives its own bag--this is likely to prevent dust and/or damage to the adhesive. Aside from fully sealing the outermost box, this is the best option. The manual contains multiple languages and instructs on how to adjust the newest feature; a magnetic charging cable holder; more on this later.

First Impressions:
The piano gloss black has been removed in favor of a less fingerprint prone matte black and the ""push panel"" has been upgraded to a more subdued and trim less soft-touch rubber. The push panel, which is used to automatically retract the arms, no longer bears the brand name, but gains a texture. This design choice is intelligent because
it lowers tooling cost and looks more premium--something the packaging is also trying to convey. All rubber grips have been slightly altered to provide a surface with more grip and depth to help hold a phone securely. I did not have any issues with devices falling out, but it is good to see.

More Details:
The suction cup and tab mechanism is largely unchanged and intuitive; no reason to fix what already works. As a side note, the instructions clearly state a ""curing"" time and temperature to mount the base and arm. If you do not adhere to the instructions, the adhesive will not form a strong bond and may fall off. Additionally, if you have a car where the dashboard is made of rubber or has been recalled for something like UV degradation (google car dashboard melting recalls), you may have an issue with the adhesive regardless--this isn't to say it won't work, but if you have a mid-2000s Toyota Camry and park in the sun, you might find that the suction cup has melted.

The Magnetic Cord Organizer:
Inside the box you will see a small black strip of rubber with 2 magnets on opposite ends [similar shape to a Breathe Right strip]. This is to wrap around your charging cable so it doesn't fall away between your chair and center console or anywhere else you wouldn't want it to fall. There is enough clearance for most phones and cases for the cable to rest in a neutral place and everyone I've showed it to did not have any issues using it with their phone.

Changes:
The arm now extends an additional 3 inches (8 total) in case you have a very long dashboard or want your phone to be as close to you as possible. The tension mount on the back of the device is now thicker, stronger, and has better quality threading--it is easier to work with when compared to last year's model. The feet are still adjustable, but the position of the feet is no longer controlled by a dial; the same piece of plastic used to hold the magnetic cord organizer can now be pushed (gently) towards to user and moved up or down depending on the height of the phone.

Notes:
There are wireless charging variants of this device, but I feel that the cost increase is not worth it--you still have to touch your phone to mount it, it takes 3-5 seconds to plug in your phone and the cable will already be directly underneath the mount.

TL;DR Its the best car mount available [that I am aware of] in its price bracket.",positive

An iPhone, as you know, is an incredibly expensive investment and it really needs to be protected so it can last a long time.

When I received this kit, it came with three sets of each of the protectors, which is GREAT! I drive a box truck full time and it’s a bumpy, hard ride. There are times when my phone takes a bit of a beating during the day. Anything I can do to minimize damage to my phone is important.

The camera lens protectors are very intuitive to install. Just make sure you clean the lenses prior to sticking in the protector. There are three, as I mentioned, so you have backup for a later date if you need to swap them out. Very cool!

The screen protector was a bit tricky for me, only because I hadn’t had previous experience with them. They are hard and I have only had soft protectors in the past. So thank goodness there were three of them because, due to my ignorance, I had trouble installing the first two and threw them away thinking I only had one shot to get them in place (like with a soft protector). This was my mistake. If you place is off-center, you can simply slip your fingernail under the edge, lift it up and reset it. Lol Don’t throw it away, like I did.

Use the included alcohol prep pad and wipe to clean your screen before putting on the protector. You want all of the dust and fingerprints off the screen because, once the protector is on, you can’t go back and clean it. Once cleaned, take one of the protectors out of the sleeve. There’s a green tab you can use to pull the film off the back. Make sure you don’t touch where the film was. This side goes against the screen. Pull the film off and use your fingertips to hold the edges. I recommend having the phone in front of you length-wise (sideways) and using two hands to center the protector on top of the screen. Be mindful that there is a small groove cut out on one end that aligns with the top of your screen. Align one edge with your phone and slowly lower the protector so it is even on the edges. The directions say to press in the middle but I found that it will start connecting with the screen on different places. If a bubble forms, simply lift the edge close to the bubble slightly to let the air out and press it down again. It’s easy to do this because it’s a hard protector. Just use small corrections, you don’t have to raise the protector up much, just a tiny bit to let the air out.

I got the screen protector on and everything worked perfectly! It wasn’t as noticeable as I thought it would be. It also had NO effect on the touchscreen functions. It’s a great protector kit and works!!!

After six months of daily use in a box truck, I began noticing small cracks and was worried that the cracks had gone through to my phone screen. I ordered another kit (because remember, being an idiot the first round, I had thrown out two of the protectors for no reason). I just peeled off my screen protector and I was AMAZED that, although the protector was crack in many places, my phone screen was in PERFECT condition! Not even a little scratch or small dent. Nothing. Just like new. I took a picture and added it to show you the first protector and my phone screen. I just put my second protector on and it was easy to install! I learned after my first round last year. :)

So please buy this if you care about your phone. It’s amazingly scratch resistant, the kit is awesome and generous with multiple back up protectors … and it works!",positive

I also notice 0 difference in screen quality or feel and I’m sure I can trust the camera lens protector if it’s anything like the screen protector. I say this because I’ve gotten a few you can almost flick and they shatter.,positive

I think OVERALL i felt these get warm ...3 times maybe ... and on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being ""oh crap, this is a fire harzard and i need something to grab onto this before my room burns up"") .... i think MAYBE i'd say a .50 out of 10 ... slighltly warm and within a minute of two of being unplugged it was not noticable and i USE THESE REGULARLY with different cords and devices ... almost daily with something i need to charge and NO PROBLEMS at all. I do have to mention those three times max was AT LEAST when the charger was plugged in 2+ hours and even with the same cord and device, and outlet and plugged into the same ""port"" ... it doesn't happen again for months ... so it's not like one bad cable or wall outlet is causing that RARE (.50 out of 10) ""heating"" issue ... IF i had any doubts i'd say it and not recommend these ... I forgot when i bought these but it's been months and I am still happy with these and not even questioning if they are safe

Feb 2022 Update: I fully admit i forgot when i orginally bought it and also i only may have swapped them ONCE since the last update ... still NOT getting burning hot like some reviews mention... still charging a-ok ... I may swap the ones I use regularly after typing this just as a test but just wanted to say months later and as someone who was concerned over the bad reviews ... everything is peachy here .. no problems at all and I do charge things at LEAST somewhat regularly

Update from Mid October: Swaping both of them just to see if there are any issues and everything is still a-ok.... the one point I want to make in this update is that I have said i have swapped ports and cables and devices, just to test things out ... I KNOW these are not ""fast chargers"" but I have charged things in both adapters with things plugged into each side and ... while I do have another OLD dual usb port wall charger (I got these as a backup, as so many things I own now need to be charged this way) ... the speed of which both items charge seem normal to me ... as advertised for those products and no issues afterwards.

The fire warnings from some negative reviews still worries me and just in case I only use them when i am right next to where they are so i could test (for heat) and/or yank them out fast ... but so far ... no issues or SIGNS Of issues of any kind

Update: Week 1 of October and I do use these regularly ... DUE TO the negative reviews I have been doing my best to switch cables (even if dont need to ... like different micro usb cables, different usb c cables ....etc) and even though i admit i have been forgetting (I charge thing REGULARLY) ... doing my best, to remember to switch not only chargers between the two ... but ports .... so far ... i think i have said this in my original review ... is not related to the cable or device specifically .. SOMETIMES (rare ... say 1 out of every .. oh 20 charges ... i am sort of making that up i admit) i feel a slight warmed to the charger only when it's plugged into the wall outlet.... say on a scale 1 to 10 ... 10 being ""this is going to cause a fire""/""so hot i cant touch it"" ... now I'd say ... a .25 maybe out of 10 ... barely a 1 .. .noticable when i do feel that but ... i cant say any other charger I have had, doesn't have the same thing happen.

i am concerned about any fire danger due to the reviews from others but ... so far my two .... have been A-OK for a few months now.

Also some 1 out of 5 reviews complain this is not a ""fast"" charger.... I KNEW THAT when I bought them. f you need a fast charger .... they are always more $$ then what looks the same but is a regular charger ... IF THAT Is what you need ... look for something like ""supports QUalcomm fast charge technology"" or something ... just ""this chargers fast"" in the general discription may be common even if its a regular charger (say 2-3 hours for devices on a regular charger but a fast charger could do it on 45minutes to 1 hour) ...some of the 1 out of 5 star reviews may have come from people that just didn't read what this charger could do .....

Update: It's now in the first week or so of September ... I admit I stopped (maybe i should start up again) switching between the two adapters and between each plug on each adapter as much as I was doing a few weeks back ... I am not sure i'd trust this (ONLY based on the bad reviews alone) leave this plugged in when I am not right next to them to yank them from the wall if there was an issue but ... STILL TO THIS DAY ... and many things being charged ... no problems at all and I cant remember what I was charging when the adapter got a little (say maybe ... oh a 1 ... 1.5 maybe out of 10 ... 10 ""being a problem"" .... but I have NOT noticed either adapter even getting slightly warm to any degree since then ... everything is a-ok so far

(Another Update ... less than 30 days ... though i forgot when i posted the update below) ... I am going back and forth between the two items and TRYING to remember to use both ports on each one ... so far NO funny sounds, i guess at times i'd say they'd get SLIGHLY warm when plugged into the wall (say a 1 out of 10 MAX .. enough to notice but BARELY enough to mention ... I JUST MENTION IT @ the reviews that say how hot theirs are .... and to be fair I dont mess with ""possible fires"" ... if i dont 100% trust these I will not use them again) .... SO FAR ... everything is a-ok and I do use them ALOT
-----
Update (still less than 30 days from purchase but with many different devices charged via usb c or micro-usb cable) SO far ... admitting some negative reviews say issues come up in say month 2 or a little after that ... everything is a-ok ... To address the ""heat"" problem i was worried about reading some reviews ... WHEN PLUGGED IN only ... on a scale from 1 to 10 ... 10 being ""too hot to touch"" ... the honest i have felt it got ... (and only SOMETIMES) would be when it was plugged in for awhile and it would be a ... 1.5 to a 2 MAX ... if that ... i leave it unplugged (due to those negative reviews and ""mine caught fire"") when i am not around if something bad happens... but ... having said that ... I dont worry too much about that when i am in the house .... these dont feel like the cheapest plastics made and probably POOR electronics on the inside .... I trust them or i'd never plug my stuff into them ... I just dont want to take a change, is all.

I'd recommend them so far even if i wish they'd offer say a 1pk for $4.50 or something (just got these as a backup to my one wall charger I 've had since 2013, that is still working great)

-----------
I have to preference that these are first impressions and while I have not checked the 4th port ... I have charged a few different devices already and tested both plugs and 3 out of the 4 total usb ports.

I am not going to open them up but they dont feel super cheap or anything ... smaller than my old white PowerGen 2.1A White charger from about 2013 (still have it and it works fine all these years later ... i just got these for a backup).

I am not going to say the are ""SUPER high quality"" or go overboard in anyway like that but the prongs seem normal and unlike some reviews I read in no way do they feel like they bend easy or fall out of outlets. I do know that some reviews mention things being fine for awhile and THEN issues start, but so far I have not seen or felt anything fishy. I DO NOT take chances with electricity being involved but with the few things I have charged .. neither adapter feels hot in any way (maybe say a .5 out of 10, when plugged in for awhile, but that is charging two devices and i say that is normal) ... also I do not hear any noise of any kind coming from the charger.

I will be SURE to update this review either way, as time goes on, but fearing a really cheap product and not wanting to mix that with electricity of course, so far ... I am pretty happy with my purchase ... I probably only needed one since my old charger still works, but ah well",positive

I use my popsocket more in lieu of a kickstand (so it doesn't need to be perfectly centered) with my phone case (which isn't bulky and certainly not Otterbox bulky). As long as the popsocket is both fully collapsed AND not in the exact center of the phone (which I assume blocks the parts in the phone that allow wireless charging), it WILL work and fully charge. Only real issue is that the popsocket probably makes it more difficult to register and therefore needs to be placed very specifically for it to start charging (one centimeter off that perfect target zone disconnects the charge).

Another thing I noticed is that it doesn't excessively overheat my phone. While the charger itself will get somewhat hot, it's not to a burning degree. And because of where my popsocket is, it makes the phone not rest directly on the charging pad; it instead has the popsocket absorb all of the heat. It also cools down really fast.

Overall, I would recommend this.",positive

With that being said: my phone sits on the charger for long periods of time. I look at it as a means of keeping my phone charged but not necessarily charging it, if that makes sense. It most definitely will charge the phone to 100%, however that does take a lot more time than the conventional way with a chord.

As far as the material goes, the chord doesn't feel like it's made of cheap material. Nor does the charging disk. I really like the green charging light that comes on. It's an easy indicator that also isn't really bright either.

I have had this charger for nearly a month now and all in all, I am very happy with my purchase!

-WILL NOT charge your phone super fast.

CABLES: The Yootech charger comes with a USB-A to micro USB cable that's engineered to work with the Qualcomm Quick Charge (QC) standards. It's visibly indistinguishable from a legacy cable so you may want to mark it. When it comes to fast charging over USB, most legacy USB cables won't work. Using this Yootech charger and a quality QC compliant power adapter, I can't get it to fast charge with several of my legacy cables. I assume the charger or the power adapter can sense if the cable is compliant or not. Bottom line is you'll need to use this cable or another one that meets the QC standard if you intend to wirelessly fast charge an iPhone or any of the 10W Android phones that the seller lists.

ADAPTERS: An adapter is NOT supplied with the Yootech charger. To support fast charging rates listed, you'll need a QC 2.0/3.0 power adapter rated at 15W or higher. I've tested the following adapters and verified that they'll fast charge an iPhone 8 Plus with the Yootech charger/cable. Please note that the battery needs to be below 80% to fast charge. Above that level Apple apparently switches to a 5W standard charging rate to preserve battery life. I've not had an opportunity to test fast charging at 10W with the listed Android phones.

I do not get these reviews at all, it seems to charge our phones at perfectly normal speeds, through cases too. The speed reminds me of plugging it straight into the lighting cable and brick from Apple. Also, no overheating issues. Sorry, but I’m assuming most of these negative reviews are user error, for anyone also feeling hesitant to buy.

Also love the aesthetic of these. I got the mint color for me, and the lavender color for my girlfriend, and both look as nice in person as they do online. Even the green glow, that stays on for a few seconds after setting your phone on the charger, looks really nice. I bought the white cable in the photo separately since I thought that was a little nicer looking than the black, at least with the mint color.

I work in technology so I have installed many screen protectors for our employees with work phones. This one is a good price and there is nothing different about the quality of this one compared to the more expensive ones that I have installed that I can see. I think the key difference with the expensive ones is that when they break or if you install it wrong they give you a free replacement. I can buy a lot of these screens though before I ever spend what one of those cost.

Here is what I suggest to install it correctly:
1: Line up the screen protector with the phone so it's lined up perfectly.
2. Take two pieces of clear tape and tape it to your phone so it's attached like a book that swings open and close.
3. Clean your phone screen with the cleaner wipe and then dry it with the drying wipe. Then use the sticky tape to pull off any little particles of dust.
4. Take the plastic off the screen protector and then flip the screen protector onto the phone like you are closing a book. It should land perfectly on the phone.",positive

I've done this tons of times and only had this problem with this one and 1 other iPad screen protector) For the price its not terrible, I can live with it, and it works to protect my phone, but if you can find a better one, just go with it.

180,Cell Phones & Accessories,"PopSockets: Phone Grip with Expanding Kickstand, Pop Socket for Phone",$8.29 - $28.33,4,"This is a different version that the one I used to own. The pop out part is on the cap (push down and twist like medical pill bottle to release) and not at the base (pop out 4 holding grooves to release). This version technically has wireless charging compatible (more on this later). If you have a lot of the older version popsocket, know that the caps don’t work on the new version.

Been using popsockets for at least half a decade now. Very functional with some minor inconveniences that I must work around, but overall worked well for me.

What I love about is it that it provides better grip when holding the phone. Now if I use a phone without it in public, feels like anyone can snatch my phone off my hand at any second, or I’m afraid I may accidently slip off my hand and drop the floor

Can get better reach with fingers while still providing grip on the phone if you carry a larger phone.

Also great as tabletop/kicks stand when I need it. Tend to use it all the time when watching steaming videos while eating or on casual video calls. No need to bring additional stand accessory

There are some official accessories for it that I use, but also made some DIY ones. For example, if you have magnet attachment phone mount, you can disassemble the popsocket and put the metal plate inside with tape, and make it attach to magnetic surfaces (This only works with older version and not this one)

This version can wirelessly charge if you attach it on your phone directly with no case. But the charging speed is not as fast than without popsocket

Adhesive works well on all phones case surfaces I currently own. Heard from a co-worker that it didn’t work for them when they used it on items with waterproof surfaces

If you have accessories that holds the popsocket in place; I wouldn’t use the popsocket on them for at least 24 hours so it doesn’t peel itself off due to gravity during initial adhesion period.

Extremely strong. Unless you intentionally use excessive force, it won’t fall off. Peeling the popsocket off can leave stains depending how long you had it on. With some cleaning tools can scrap it off without leaving much residue. Use hand sanitzer to take off the residue, better than using soup or just water.
To take it off once it’s stuck on you must use fingernails (will not work if you have long nails) or a thin flat head screw driver around the circumference

They are durable. Aside from paint wearing off overtime, the first one I own still works like it did day 1. I’m not rough with my popsocket or phones so may want to take that under consideration (?)

-Cons of the popsocket can be worked around.

It adds thickness. As thick or slightly thicker than your phone without a case, making it 2x thicker at one location. If you wear tight pants/jeans, there will get a budge, especially if you put it in your back pocket.

Seeing the bulge is not uniform can wobble when typing on phone on a flat surface.

If you stick the popsocket on the phone directly, may interfere with some of its functionality such as wireless charging (if you have the older version). That’s why I always opt to put it on a case.

Never happened to me, but my co-worker said it get snatched onto things when trying to pull it out of her purse. Maybe she has way too many stuff in there, or the fact that I always carry my phone in my pocket or dedicated pocket in my backpack.

Overall, despite the negatives I find it very useful for daily tasks.",positive

It stays in place and doesn’t wiggle around and the touch screen works just as well as it does when it didn’t have one on.

▸I really like how the design is pretty simple yet effective without necessarily needing to sacrifice its aesthetic. It's super easy to clean and ""maintain"" too.
Previous phone cases I've used would show wear and tear over time until I needed to replace them eventually so aesthetics were often compromised. But this case has lasted in color, no visible dirt has accumulated or any discoloration (darkening/lightening of color) has occurred on the case in the past year. This is just a tiny nice bonus of keeping my case my favorite color. :)
If I want to clean my phone to get rid of accumulated gunk in the holes, it's really easy and gentle to just remove the case without needing to wrestle with my phone like my previous cases: bullet cases, wallet cases, etc. This isn't to say the case is loose and easy to come off when unwanted though, it fits snugly on my phone and has never separated from my phone when I didn't want it to.

▸Considering how many times I've accidentally dropped my phone while hiking, the quality of the case has stayed the same over the year.
There has only been one tiny abrasion on one corner of my phone case, yet my phone has still remained damage-free. I included an image of the only visible ""wear and tear"" over the year.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with this purchase and even thought of buying a second case to switch it up when I'm bored of my light blue or whenever I'd need a replacement for my current one. I'll update my review until then.",positive

The case is very thin and I cannot say for certain how protective it will be over time. I can't say anything bad about this case as it is fine. It is exactly what the seller claims.

I expect I might drop my phone a few times during its lifetime, and I've dropped this phone maybe once. I don't expect the protection of a hardcover case, but it does wrap above the screen a little, so it may act as bumpers if I unfortunately drop my phone screen-faced-down. The ""bumpers"" keep a low profile, so I don't suspect they would be too effective. But any jagged edge on the ground would put the screen protector to the test, and not the case, no matter what case you had on. So this case does its job, it's simple, easy to hold, its color is as advertised, it keeps the back glass of my phone shiny, and overall I'm pleased with this case. Obviously I can be safe from any chippings and hopefully a cracked back-glass of my phone if and when I do drop it. But for this price, I'm not expecting much insurance.",positive

This band's coloring is exactly how it looks in the photo and the rose gold metal of the band goes perfectly with my watch.

It's actually pretty easy to put on and take off. I resorted to the slip-on bands for a while but couldn't quite find the coloring I wanted in those. But, with one hand, this is easy enough to put on.

The only grievance I have with the band is that when you sweat, it does collect a bit of moisture since it's more or less a rubber-like band with its material. Regardless, this band is perfect for the price.",positive

Looks about as original as silicone one that would come with the watch. Will probably be able to get a year’s worth of use before the silicone starts to ‘shine’ due to friction against other surfaces.
Peeves:
The buckle sticks out a little, I’d have liked the strap to be a 1/4in longer so that I had more to tuck in than I do today (large wrist, smaller dial issues). The pin style is more finicky than the classic single silver button style you find more commonly for the watch.",positive

My car is a 2005 Outback. It doesn’t have a capability for me to play my music from my library on my phone. I’ve been stuck with either cd’s or the radio.

So when I installed this holder, placed my phone in it, I had the notion to turn on my music. The effect was surprisingly great!

True, it wasn’t a Dolby stereo system, but it was so nice to have my library in my car and so accessible.

As for the functionality of the holder, it holds my iPhone12 very well. It opens and closes, hugging my phone securely. It releases with the press of the button.

I’m wondering if I don’t have it attached exactly right, it swivels from left to right when my car turns. Not a big issue, and like I said, I may need to secure and tighten it better.

My only redesign suggestion is to make the bottom prongs adjustable too, so you can adjust how low the phone sits in the cradle, thus enabling the side clamps to grasp the phone farther up the sides.

Update

Can not say enough about this screen protector...

Thank goodness I had three.

My other 4⭐️ review was about to fit over a curved edge screen for the iPhone SE second generation.

Despite that one issue for the first install what happens during an issue saved the phone. Having extra screens saved the circumstance even further.

These are must-own protectors because they work exceptionally well.

My example. During a basic drop, the protector cracked but the screen didn't. I left the slightly cracked screen protector on because it functioned and didn't feel the need to have a new screen on again.

About a year goes by. My friend is on the passenger side of the Jeep. Moves the seat.

Later that evening I get home. Can't find the phone anywhere.

Normally it's in my bag or the median cup holder.

Using the find my phone option knows it's I the Wrangler, but still can't find it.

Bt this time I’ve rolled the passenger seat forward all the way and back a few times. Can't find the phone.

Going over to the passenger side look way under the seat in the mid position meaning middle of the track it slides on. The phone is sticking out about a half-inch from the track crushed under the seat.

It’s wedged in so much so it is not removable. At all.

I move the seat completely forward shoved it against the window... If you don't have a Jeep, the seat glides fully back or folds forward into the front window off the track.

The phone was so wedged into the track face up with a back cover that holds my license and a couple of cards which didn't help.

With a bunch of effort was able to unwedge and remove the phone.

Amazingly, the protector was crushed in a few spaces. But once removing the actual phone screen was only slightly nicked in two places.

I added a new protector to hold the phone screen together while waiting for the repairs the following afternoon.

The phone worked with the new protector despite the phone being crushed in two places.

Repairs we're complete and the final protect added.

I ordered a new pack of protectors to have on hand. Best seven dollars I've ever spent.

I can't say thank-you enough for this super economical well explained install protector.

Even though my first try didn't get the protection to sit flat this time worked perfectly. The protector sits perfectly flat.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💯 must own

Update /\ more than a year later

Use this screen protector on my iPhone SE 1st gen. Upon reviewing 2nd gen iphone SE reviews decided to purchase. Knowing the risk it wouldn’t stick perfectly around the curved edges.

Owning tools for changing an iPhone battery and screen installation find the spatula, with a credit card type of plastic with flexibility could help gentle perfectly assist with sealing the seems.

Result, most of the edge sits perfectly on the screen. 1/16th of the edge on one side about an inch long refuses to connect to the screen no matter how much pressure I’ve used with the spatula.

I’m not certain if this would affect the ability of the protector to help the phone stay protected.

With my SE 1st gen the protector shattered once and the second cracked across the screen at an angle.

My previous experience with plastic screens as a part of the protective cover never cracked.

My phone did well. No breaks. The protectors appear like bicycle helmets. One use then throw away.

The clear plastic screen protectors attached you the cases are more expensive. Unless, you go through protectors like me. Then, maybe it’s worth buying the more expensive case with plastic screen saver.

I’ve got three screens with this kit. A nice case. I’m satisfied with the overall appearance and ease of install with my spatula. If you don’t have one use a credit card or any flexible card from your wallet will do well.

Even thought the screen instructions say install like a door. My preference is, with the spatula, from top to bottom. Pressing the spatula from one end to the other to get a tight fit.

Then, move the spatula around the edges firmly. Until the sides stick.

The spatula can also move a tiny bubble out. Press from the middle and move the spatula toward the side. Pushing the ting bubble IF one installed during installation.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Four stars. Minus one because I find it impossible install the screen protector perfectly. This may affect the use if the phone drops and the protector isn’t grabbed to the phone. Therefore allowing phone to crack.

Make sure to include a hearty strong case, too",positive

My own experience putting it on my iPhone SE (2020) confirms what others have had to say. JETech's ingenious (unique) method of applying the protector worked like a charm when it came to lining everything up (shining a bright light on the phone screen so you can see the cutouts also helps). The initial bubbles were easily dispensed with by (as they suggested) lifting a corner of the protector, then putting it back down. And unlike some iPhone SE protectors, this one gets close enough to the edges for the case to cover the rest (I highly recommend the Smartish case while I'm at it).

I’ve had my phone, iPhone 11, for well over 2 years and all my phones before this one I always had an otter box case but I wanted a cute case for once and decided to try a screen protector.

I tried this one since I figured it comes with two so if I mess up the first application I’ll be fine! I did not mess up the first application and the very first protector has lasted me 15 months and honestly longer if I didn’t care about the “cracks.”

My phone is in pristine condition and a lot of it has to do with this screen protector. You can see the cracks and divets the protector took and it was still fully functional.

The two reasons I replaced it was bc 1. I had a second one to still use and 2. ready for a non-cracked screen.

My phone fell out of my pocket as I was hustling to make a light at a crosswalk and I didn’t realize it was gone until the light had turned red. When I looked back and realized it was in the road, I frantically hit the crosswalk button for the light to turn back to green, as I watched two cars run over my phone, which was screen-side down.

When I got back to the phone, the screen protector had tons of little cracks (still pretty much in one piece). The phone was still working, but I made my husband take off the screen protector, because I couldn’t stand to look at my destroyed screen. To our surprise, the screen was completely fine - no cracks, not even a scratch (as an FYI I also had a Vena phone case on the phone). I’m even writing this review from that run over phone.

This thing is _DENSE_ for its size. It weighs about the same as my previous Google charger and also supplies the same amount of power. I have a USB-C cable that measures wattage output and my P6P shows that it is taking in 18W of power (Which is what it did with the 30W charger from Google as well, don't want to talk about it but Google lied about how fast their phones charge).

It does exactly what you would expect it to, and I like how the prongs fold up, it’s a nice touch.

I recently got this brick for my 12.9 M1 iPad Pro, the iPad itself supports 30 watt sustained fast charging and can peak around the 35 watt range at times. However the 45 watt rating on the brick won’t affect your iPad battery life expectancy. It’ll work seamlessly. (Magic Keyboard pass through port supports 22 watts)

It charges much faster than the included brick out of the box. I think a full charge takes around 2 hours using the main USB-C port.

However, since this is such a small chassis there will be some extra heat coming off the brick compared to the original; in my experience with Anker, there’s nothing to worry about.

390,Cell Phones & Accessories,"JETech Screen Protector for iPhone 11 Pro, for iPhone Xs, for iPhone X, 5.8-Inch, Tempered Glass Film, 2-Pack",$6.99,5,"TLDR: it protected my screen from a screen-down 4-foot drop onto a sharp rocky driveway, was easy to replace/install, and is inexpensive for infrequent drops. Also, I spent longer typing this on my phone than I did installing the protector 🫠

Protection:
I don’t drop my phone often, but when I do, I try and grab it and end up throwing it into the ground harder than it otherwise would have. In this way, I slammed it into my sharp rocky driveway screen down from about 4’. The screen-pro totally spidered, but my iPhone X (with case) was completely fine. Since the protector has a flexible gummy layer (much like auto glass), it was still usable (relatively comfortably) for the 3 days shipping until my new one arrived. Which brings me to…

Install:
Found the install easy; the stickers and cleaning kit make one-try alignment simple and it stuck instantly to my phone screen. Bubbles were easy to remove as well. Overall, had it replaced in ~5 mins from opening the box to tossing my busted screen-pro. Normally, I’d wager replacement would be challenging if your hand-eye coordination needs a tune-up, but that’s what the stickers are for.

Anti-glare:
I mean, I guess? It doesn’t make normal screen reflectiveness on my iPhone X worse.. But, as you can see in photo 2 (the one that I didn’t drop from a ladder and throw), there is a bit of reflection.

Touch responsiveness:
Yup. I touch and my screen registers it. Played some pubg (crazy I know) just to make sure it was fine. Maybe you’ll notice but I don’t.

Thickness:
It’s not thick. Like, 2 mm tops.

Clarity:
It’s clear. Cleans easily and doesn’t scratch. Also, when I totally spidered it in the aforementioned drop, I could still see through the cracked regions (photo 1).

Conclusion:
Yeah, totally great for sub $10 screen-pro. And you get two, which is nice. It saved my triple-digit-dollar phone from a screen replacement, so I’m happy. That’s honestly the only reason I’m writing this review. In a few mins (unlike this review), I had it replaced and a new one queued up for the next unexpected drop-test. It’ll probably protect your device too, as it held on strong for about 13 months before I spiked it off the ground and it cracked for the first time. Not sure why I feel so strongly about this. Hope your day is nice. Peace.",positive

Written and video step by step instructions! The cleaning and prep process was fool proof with the video instructions!

I suggest washing hands first, and cleaning your work area for dust etc. before hand. you can see in The picture that 2 tiny specs were somehow still left on the screen… I tried pushing them out as though they were bubbles, with no success. You can see that I lifted the corner, I used the dust sticker (provided) to try and lift the spec… but it’s still there, and the corner was compromised in the process.

The sheet automatically attached (I didn’t even have to run my finger over it). That was nice, but be prepared that once it touches, it’s staying there (even with the lift sticker). The left side edges had some streaks of air underneath where it didn’t attach.. just a little pressure seemed to do the trick.

Super nice part - their includes two complete screen protectors and application kits. So if you screw up, you e got a back up, and if all goes well, you have another kit for down the road.

My placement seems to have created a psychedelic visual with the screens light), which is distracting (see pics - bottom and right edges) . I suggest keeping the phone on, so you can the the placement perfectly centered).

That broke within a few months. Next I purchased a $35 one from Apple that they said is covered by a lifetime warranty and if it breaks you can go on the website and get a “free” replacement, just pay shipping. Well that one broke too. The shipping for the “free” replacement was $8. Fed up with over paying for screen protectors that broke every few months, I checked to see if I could find one on here for better. Boy I wish I had come here first. Would have saved me almost $100. This 2 pack was around $5 when I bought it, and it was worth every penny even if it had been a single. Easily worth the dual pack. My mother had the same phone as me and also had her protector from Apple break around the same time so I shared my second with her. We both love them. Trust me, I’ve had the $60 one, I’ve had the $35 one, they are exactly the same. Same clarity, same feel, same protection.

I had the two expensive ones installed in the stores where I bought them, but I had to put this one on myself. I’ve put protectors on other devices before so it wasn’t my first rodeo, but it was the first time I applied a protector on my phone. It’s not perfectly straight as there’s a bit of a slant but it’s heavy enough that there are no bubbles and you can peel it up real quick before it settles if you need to retry. I find lining up the curve part at the top and slowly lowering it down the length of the phone is the best strategy. But overall much easier than I expected. Just clean your screen first cause a lot of junk gathers around the rim of your old protector.

I’m writing this review now because this replacement protector actually just cracked while in my purse recently, just a tiny crack on the corner, barely noticeable unlike the others ones that fractured the entire screen protector. It’s actually the longest I’ve had a protector on this phone before it broke. When the $60 one broke I was pissed, when the $35 one broke I was very annoyed, when this one broke, I was like, oh well, time to lay down another $5 for a two pack.

I am so so grateful for these. In the past, I’ve gotten the expensive one and been fine until I decide to get a new phone. Maybe I end up getting one replacement in the average 4 year span I tend to have a phone, but I have never gone through so many screen protectors so quickly and hot damn you really need a cheaper alternative these days. If it protects my phone, I’m happy, and I know for a fact now that it does because the crack in this cheap protector would have been a crack in my actual screen. They’re so cheap to replace and keep buying new ones to keep my phone protected instead of sitting with a damaged one because they’re too expensive to replace. I’m buying a replacement right now even though the price has gone up a dollar and I don’t really need to replace it at the moment cause the crack is so small. I’ve just found in general that once it cracks initially, the second crack isn’t usually far behind. That’s also why it’s great to have the two pack because you have that back up for when it does crack, as it’s supposed to. I gave mine away, but the spare now on my mom’s phone hasn’t cracked yet so they’re both pretty great.",positive

And as opposed to most vent clips, this clamps tightly on with a hook and tightening nut. There is some minor vibration, it is just on a vent wing, but most of it can be adjusted out by giving the clamp a little snug (I'd be careful here, one or two clicks tightening at a time).

You'll have to check your air vents before purchasing just to be sure the shape will allow space for the hook on the back of the mount, but most cars should be fine. This guy is pretty sturdy, and has full range of motion. I've driven on some windy and bumpy roads and my phone has held on securely so far. It also feels so much closer to reach than my old popsocket mount, which is safer for GPS use and such.

I have various Qi chargers, but decided to try a MagSafe, and I can say that it is worth it for a compatible iPhone. With no case the magnet sticks well to the phone, which is great for bedside usage. No longer do I need to fumble around to find the Qi charging pad after picking it up; the pad stays on the phone! Also great when going to bed with an almost dead phone and then browsing a bit on the phone in bed, as it will be charging.

Since this is a Qi charger it also works on my Samsung phone, though it charges at a very slow rate. Not sure if that is Apple's doing or Samsung, but whatever the reason I get 3.25W charge rate using a S21 but the full 15W charge rate on iPhone 13. So I wouldn't use this as a general purpose Qi charger, just for iPhone unless you're in a pinch.

The cord does not come off the charger, but I think that's a good thing for when you pick up the phone with it attached to the back.

Do yourself a favor and buy this genuine Apple MagSafe Charger. We thought competing wireless charging products would work, they do, but they fail to hit the sweet spot and fail to maximize charging. Worse, sometimes we missed setting our iPhones down correctly on the competing products and missed the charging opportunity altogether. There’s nothing worse than having an iPhone that has little battery life remaining. This eliminates that possibility and charges super-fast. The MagSafe Charger makes wireless charging a snap. The magnets perfectly align so at to attach to our iPhone 12 &13 Pro Max’s and charge at (15) watts, about (3x) faster than our previous off-brand charger. You will notice that, because the phone does get worm from all that juice flowing in. We waited too long to get this, and we regret that now. We also bought Apple’s 20W USB-C Power Adapter (sold separately). We were able to buy both genuine Apple products from Amazon at discounted prices which we liked. Why risk your super expensive iPhone to some no name charger. You get what you pay for, knuckle under and just buy, you won’t regret it. Works flawlessly.

With as many good reviews as the MagSafe charger has, a properly working one is probably awesome. Just be careful where you buy one. I’ll be going to the Apple Store next time.

It turns out my phone’s logistics board was in the process of failing and the wireless charging/MagSafe capability was the first thing to go.

The bottom line is that the Magsafe Charger is a good product. But as many other said, it's a problem that you have to spend another $20-30 for the USB-c charger if you don't have any already.

And here is my problem. (you can see from below), mine stopped working after 3 mo. I tried all possible ways to test it, but no success, so I got another one, and that didn't work either, so I took it to Apple store nearby. Genius staff tried all combination (phone, charger, cable, adopter), and to my surprise, he found that the 20W power adapter I bought (since i didn't have any USB-c adapter) was the faulty one.

Also, you can check if your Magsafe charger is regit or not by putting your phone on it, and see:
Setting>General>About. You should see the MagSafe Charger listed there with model# and firmware version.

Do, I leave my original review below but my current MagSafe charger is good, but the 20W adopter was bad/defective. If your MagSafe stop working, first check your adapter. My adopter is out or return/exchange range, so I bought mine from Apple store...

Below is my original review.. but it was my adapter and not the MagSafe charger that failed.

It was working (after spending additional for wall charger adopter ..), but after 3 months, it suddenly stopped working... tried every possible ways to test it, with no success... WHY????? This is THE APPLE right??? It's already past the 30 day return window... Am I to just sit here and cry? Very disappointed.. it might be a rare case that I won a lemon, but since i cannot return or exchange it, I must say it was a waste of money.
(I still like apple, and Amazon is still my lifeline... just FYI)

Add: Just contacted Amazon customer service. I must add that the customer service (chat) was great and helpful. This is one of the top reasons that Amazon is my #1 choice.",positive

I believe this product is hugely overpriced but it is probably the best so I recommend getting it because second-best isn’t worth your time. When you use a Mag charger you want it to position itself well and work every time. Discovering that it failed to properly seat itself after a “night of charging“ is a problem.,positive

The charger works just fine as it should
No complaints about it love it. love the wireless charging no need for charging cord plugged in phone I can just grab the phone and not ending up pulling the charging cube out of the wall with the cord plugged in to phone as I have done so many times before. so I totally recommend this to all iPhones users with phones that support wireless charging
You will love it a lot",positive
