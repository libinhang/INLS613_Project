0,Home & Kitchen,"YETI Rambler 10 oz Lowball, Vacuum Insulated, Stainless Steel with MagSlider Lid",$15.00 - $67.28,5,"This is a great cup, and although it’s not 100% leak proof I would not expect that with lid styles like these. It does prevent big messes if accidentally tipped over but isn’t easy to tip over anyway. It feels good in the hand, looks smooth and durable and is great for any beverage you can think of.

Some of my favorite features are:

1. Mag slider, its awesome because I can remove it and thoroughly clean the lid. No trapped funk!

2. The press in lid. It’s a strong seal and no awkward thread aligning issues. Not too hard to remove and easy to clean! Keeps pesky cats out of my bedside water too.

3. The lip of the cup is smooth. I like drinking from the cup as much without the lid as I do with the lid.

4. it’s a good size, not too big that I wouldn’t want to put wine or a cocktail into it, and not too small for coffee or tea. I like a lot of coffee and tea and don’t mind having to refill this more often. My pour over fits over this perfectly too..

5. The copper color, while not bright copper fits in well with my decor, and looks classy.

6. Great insulation! I haven’t tested exactly how long things stay hot or cold but I did scald my tongue about an hour after making tea..

So take extreme caution with hot beverages!",positive

I was finally able to drink liquid again. This cup was the perfect size for the cold brew pods I found, it was easy to add the right amount of liquid. I would have the nurses fill the cup halfway with ice each night before bed, then in the morning I could add the coffee, creamer and water to make the perfect cup of iced coffee, and it stayed icy cold for hours as I slowly drank it. I still use the cup now, even though I am home and able to do everything I could before getting sick. It also keeps a hot coffee hot for hours.",positive

10,Home & Kitchen,Amazon Basics Lightweight Super Soft Easy Care Microfiber Bedding,$7.65 - $47.73,5,"I needed some sheets for my sleeper couch that is mostly used by my sons and their friends, and our dogs (corgis). I wanted something that would look decent, be comfortable, and didn’t cost a lot. It’s a relatively new couch, and my kids are pre-teen so they are still pretty messy. I like to keep the couch completely covered so their dirty little Cheeto fingers don’t get all over everything, and their little boy stink doesn’t rub off on the couch. I liked these sheets so much that I ended up getting two more sets for my sons’ beds. They wash up nicely (so far), and the dog hair doesn’t stick to them.",positive
11,Home & Kitchen,Amazon Basics Lightweight Super Soft Easy Care Microfiber Bedding,$7.65 - $47.73,5,"For two years. Two years I suffered in silence. Yes. I.... I a struggling young adult struggled with only one... Yes that's right ONE set of sheets. Every week it was the same. Strip the bed. Wash the sheets, dry the sheets, remake the bed. Over the 2 years my one poor set of sheets took a beating. They saw countless menstrual cycles, various cold and flue viruses, dogs, and sleep overs. I meticulously washed and bleached those sheets until one day I took them from the wash and noted that they were beyond bleaching or stain removal. There were dying.... They were dying gray.

I searched high and low. Went to target and TJ Maxx... But to no avail. Why... Why were simple square pieces of fabric $50.00!?!?!? I could not afford this. I could not justify the spending of $50.00 on plain white fabric. So I searched. I searched high and I searched low Until I came here...
To The Amazon.

It was here. Here I discovered them. Plain white sheets at a modest and affordable price.
""Don't buy them! You'll regret it! You need Egyptian cotton!"" My mother said.

""No! I care not what cotton they be! All I need are sheets! I have no one to impress! No one who shares my bed! I am a lowly virgin promised in matrimony to another with a sworn vow of chastity! I care not for fancy sheets!"" I shouted.

So I bought them. I made my bed and I laid in it. And I can tell you that yes... They are I fact sheets that you can sleep in.",positive

It's a blue but not navy blue.

Fit on new thick adjustable mattress, had to figure out which side was the top vs the side, the elastic goes all the way around.

Cannot call it soft but can call it thin. Like a summer sheet. I can see the TV screen through the material with the lamp on behind me.

Will try for a few nights and see how I feel about it after a week.",positive

I had to move into a motel because of the economy right now, these are amazing and fit over the comforter that the motel gives the bed as well. The bed is a full sized bed, here they don't allow you to have your own sheets unless you put them over their sheets and blankets. I'd rather not sleep on motel sheets especially because I know they don't wash them!!! It's so nasty! These protect me from the grossness and don't slide off. They fit all around the sheets and bed and under. They get wrinkled easily, I'm not sure if it's because I'm putting them on top of other sheets (they're not wrinkled), or what, but I'd buy this brand again any day!",positive

I haven't been able to find decent sheets that fit. Every other set popped off at the upper corner during the night. These stayed put. I love the color and they are soft.

30,Home & Kitchen,Beckham Hotel Collection Bed Pillows for Sleeping,$33.16 - $44.99,5,"OK, let's clear up a few things:
1) I am a real buyer, was not given this pillow, was not paid to review this pillow. There's no way I'm doing any of that.
2) I want everyone to know exactly what I'm giving an opinion on. This ""Beckham Hotel"" pillow is the very same as others called ""Sleep Restoration Super Plush Gel-Fiber Filled Pillows"". That's what the package the two pillows (costing $35 total) came in reads, and there's a small bar-coded sticker with tiny writing indicating the Beckham Hotel re-branding.
3) There's NO smell. There's NO mildew. They arrived factory clean and shipped in a nice, zipped plastic container bag.
4) They arrive dead flat. When you remove them, they start to fluff up. I'd say after an hour or so they are ready to use. Fluff them a bit, and you can sleep on them right away. It's not necessary to put them in a dryer and in fact it could be detrimental. Not sure.
5) I waited a month to write this because I wanted to be sure I liked the pillows. I do!
6) I had some doubts at first because I thought they'd be too soft, but after a couple of nights I would now describe them as soft, yet firm enough to support my head and neck correctly. I start out sleeping on my side and of course, at some point end up on my back, and then often back on my side.
7) They're heavy enough to no move around, but not heavy like a (solid) memory foam pillow is. They stay put in other words.
8) I purchased the queen sized ones. Now, it was sort of interesting to me that these are 20 inches wide, and yet a queen size pillowcase is also 20 inches wide. Yet, a pillow is quite high and a pillowcase is of course - flat. This means it requires some effort to squeeze the pillow into the pillowcase. BUT, perhaps this makes the pillow seem a bit firmer than my initial impression of it was in paragraph #6. At any rate, it works and these have worked out well for me.
9) I woke up in a hotel about 4 years ago with neck pain and had it ever since. All sorts of chiropractic efforts, daily neck stretches, painkillers, etc. just didn't seem to get rid of it. I ditched my Tempur-Pedic s-shaped solid memory foam pillow and tried several other pillows I got locally. They all went back. I got these pillows, continued on the daily neck stretches and now I'm feeling fine with no more neck pain. I noticed about a week ago I was waking up with no more neck pain. That's a relief.

That's about all I can tell you Amazon shoppers. Buying a pillow is a wilderness of choice. I spent a LOT of hours on here looking. And of course pillows, and the comfort of them, is very personal and subjective. I can only say, for me, these worked out. If they don't for you, I assume you can return them, possibly with some shipping cost. I don't know. I'm not a regular Amazon customer and not a Prime member.
Best of luck finding yours!

31,Home & Kitchen,Beckham Hotel Collection Bed Pillows for Sleeping,$33.16 - $44.99,1,"New pillow's on the left. Same exact pillow I bought previously, on the right.

Pillows are a lot like men to me. Most I come across, I don't particularly care for. Others I eye and ohh and ahh over their expensive qualities and good looks, but I don't just take anything home. No, first I'll cyber stalk and read every line and review I can get my hands on, then I may ask a question or two, and spend time with it to see what it does under pressures. Because I've had my heart, and yes indeed, neck broken, and support is alongside Godliness and I'm choosing what I'll be with every night, and they got to love me as much as I love them.

I chose this pillow, loved this pillow, spent years buying it for myself and others for birthdays and anniversaries and housewarming parties...because I wanted everyone to enjoy and love it as much as I did. Instead of getting my hair or nails done, or shopping for shoes or a new sweater, for self-love I'd buy another set and use the old in my duvet shams, and all the flowers and chocolates, and tender words of endearment...never made me feel more spoiled. It was divine.

It was one thing I could count on in my life to be PERFECT. Your family can be struck down with Covid, your job may lay you off, you make take on more weight faster than a sinking ship, and hear your mother's compliments on too wide of hips, and split ends, but it was always waiting for me, in all of it's glory, and made my world a better place.

I had two boxes of vacuumed packed pillows sitting in my closet, because when you find something this perfect, you're a fool to let them sell out or be discontinued, and will spend your whole life looking for a replacement with some kind of resemblance, only to be disappointed. Yesterday when I slid my scissors across the top, I was already grinning and waiting to pull the pillow out since it'd leave the bag bursting at the seams since they inflate so rapidly - - only it didn't happen. I pulled out the flat compressed lumps and set them up to air and tried fluffing them, and left them overnight before putting them in the dryer in hopes of fluffing them up - - but they feel significantly less and are as fluffed as they will get. I ran to my room and stripped down my old, comparing tags, because this was a mistake. This wasn't really my pillow, but an imposter. Dang it, I must've ordered a different size somehow. But no. Same size, ""same"" pillow, the only thing different is RN numbers which mean absolutely nothing to me, only that I've been betrayed and feel the pain of being replaced with something a year newer and half the weight that hasn't even filled out like people do in time. I hate them with more resentment than one should, but these were actually meaningful to me, and now they're never going to be the same.

Beckman, you can take my one star and stuff it in someone else's pillow, so their neck doesn't hit the mattress when they lay down. You cut corners and got greedy and decided people would still buy your pillows at the same price without noticing...and you were wrong. Do you even sleep on your own pillows? Is there a third generation running this business who's too busy at the country club and in Mexico too many times a year to care about the worker bee's buying these pillows? You can paint greed up and down and it's still gonna be ugly. While my return window may be closed, I'll warn others so they know what to expect. So the ones faithful to you will know you weren't faithful back.",negative
32,Home & Kitchen,Beckham Hotel Collection Bed Pillows for Sleeping,$33.16 - $44.99,4,"Ive had 4 of these pillows since late 2020 and they got some stains on them so I ordered two new pillows (NOT THESE) and gave 2 of these to my sister and I REGRET IT. the new ones that are from a different brand are too fat and not comfortable and hot. Where as these pillows are cool and just the right size and supportive and comforting. The new pillows I just got always end up on the floor and the two I have of these save me from neck pain the new pillows I bought give me. As soon as I can I’m ordering more of these pillows if you ever have bought these and think “let me try a new pillow” DON’T. my sister also loves the pillows I gave her and says she’s gotten the best sleep because of them. I will never switch up on this pillow again. I never reviewed these before because I never realized how good my sleep was until I got rid of them. I highly recommend these pillows!! They’re the perfect pillow. My cats love them and are always laying on them too.

I’m docking a star only because I saw other reviews about this but didn’t believe it because I had such a great experience the first time I ordered. I recently ordered these pillows again and they’re significantly less full than the previous ones I ordered. I thought it was just when I opened them and that they would plump up but they haven’t. I keep having to fold it to make it more full. I really liked these pillows because they were the perfect size and fullness and now the second time I ordered they’re less full. I’ve seen a few other reviews saying the same thing how they ordered more and they were different. It makes me a little sad because I know how good these pillows are (because I got good ones last time) but if I would’ve received the ones I got this time the first time I ordered, I wouldn’t have bought anymore/ felt the way I reviewed the first time. Like these pillows I got the second time are flat. Hopefully y’all can resolve this issue in the future. Makes me weary of ordering again not going to lie.",positive
33,Home & Kitchen,Beckham Hotel Collection Bed Pillows for Sleeping,$33.16 - $44.99,5,"I had bought 2 of the Wamsattu Dream Zone pillows years ago ($139 ea) and I have loved them. A few days ago I decided I wanted to buy two more. However, after finding them on Amazon I noticed this other option below with 40-50,000 reviews (69% being five star) this was the Beckham Hotel Collection and the one thing that sold me other than the glowing reviews was the price!! OMG. So I took a chance on these 2 pillows ($40 for both). Too good to be true, right? WRONG. These are probably the most wonderfully soft and supportive pillows I have ever slept on. We are now in the perfect 3-way marriage and are all sleeping like babies every single night. Its a sleeping experience I cannot emphatically express my sincere happiness. I’m 100% positive if you buy these, you’ll begin sleeping better immediately. And in my case, it was literally bc they were at my doorstep at 6am the very next day. You’re crazy to go with any other.

34,Home & Kitchen,Beckham Hotel Collection Bed Pillows for Sleeping,$33.16 - $44.99,4,"Tomorrow will be exactly 2 years since I first purchased these pillows. At $20 per pillow (when I first bought them) the value was excellent, so much so that I decided to purchase a second pair today! When looking at rich people stores/websites where the bourgeoisie-class privileged waste their money, pillows can go for stupid amounts of money, for only diminishing returns.

These pillows are very comfortable, quite large, and provided enough support for my head. This gives me a pseudo-glimpse into what the rich and famous get to experience daily and give no second thoughts about. I am a side sleeper so I would often put the second pillow between my knees as I slept. I imagine this is why the quality degraded faster than I expected. I was looking to get 3-4 years out of the pillows.
This morning I could not figure out why my neck was sore more and more often. Well, it must be the pillows! Over 2 years, I washed them on hot and dried them on hot. They got very lumpy and flattened slightly. To be fair, I could have treated them better, but nobody got time for dat.

Ultimately, I am happy enough to get 2 years out of them, even after the abuse I put them through. I was even able to impress several, uh, bed partners with the pillows! My ONLY complaint is that they are sooo fluffed up that when I lay on them, they will sometimes engulf my face and my claustrophobia will trigger. This is fixed by just moving my head to the edge of the pillow, ergo no harm, no foul.",positive

The pillow fits perfectly into my queen cases and the two of them fit across my queen mattress. Thickness great for back sleeping. The sculpted shape of the pillow is about 10% smaller around the middle. This helps keep the cases on with no buttons or zipper. Or snaps. Next the side sleeping. Works quite well and better than expected if I fold my head pillow so a double thickness supports my head. Delightful support with sister pillow between my bent knees. Now I wake up an hour earlier each morning because sleeping more deeply and more relaxed, I think. Gained an hour in my day… an unexpected benefit of incalculable value compared to a trivial cost. Yay new pillows!",positive
36,Home & Kitchen,Beckham Hotel Collection Bed Pillows for Sleeping,$33.16 - $44.99,4,"I ordered these pillows mainly for the “Gel cooling” feature advertised. My 1st order was missing a pillow. I used the Amazon chat feature and was immediately shipped a new order which arrived 2 days later, containing 2 pillows. The pillows come vacuum packed and the instructions were to open it and let the pillows rise over 24 hours before use. We did this and used them the next night. They were EXTREMELY comfortable, for comfort purposes I would have left 5 stars. I really like them. For cooling purposes, not so much. Perhaps I need different pillowcases to aid in the cool feature described. I’m currently looking into higher thread count pillowcases to see if this helps. My husband didn’t care for these pillows. He said they were too puffy and he woke with a stiff neck, he will continue to use his “My Pillow” I, however, really enjoyed this pillows comfort and will continue to use it with or without the cooling feature advertised.

I sleep through the night again and the cool comfy feeling when you lay down is 5x as long than with regular dollar store pillows that go flat in 3 days.

I have not washed these in the wash machine yet. But from my experience as a laundry attendant at a hotel. I understand you are supposed to wash pillows with heavy materials such as towels wash cloths hand towels and so on.

I've had these for almost a month and I can already see an improvement in my sleep and quality of life and work. Highly recommend. I just have bad anxiety that why I gave 4 stars for sleep quality. Hopefully that will change one day.",positive
38,Home & Kitchen,Beckham Hotel Collection Bed Pillows for Sleeping,$33.16 - $44.99,5,"I'm probably being dramatic when I say sleeping on a cloud but the reality is I've suffered with neck and shoulder pain for years from all different kinds of pillows. I tried cooling, memory foam, neck support, expensive pillows, name brand or TV advertised, cheap pillows and pillows that caused me to have reactions (sensitive skin). In addition, my bed and my memory foam toppers, hurt my body.

This pillow just gave me pure relief. It feels like my head melts into it. I waited for the review bc I wanted to make sure it wasn't just a one night thing or bc I was extra tired one night but no, it's been consistent 😊 very happy!!!

39,Home & Kitchen,Beckham Hotel Collection Bed Pillows for Sleeping,$33.16 - $44.99,5,"I have bought so many pillows. SO. MANY. PILLOWS. I should have just got these from the start. I saw the amount of reviews and still said, “eh but I’m gonna try this one and this one and this one first”. I bought so many freaking pillows and spent so much unnecessary money on others. Well we bought a camper and needed pillows for the full size bed and our king size pillows weren’t gonna cut it. These were on sale so I finally said well let’s try these for the camper. Y’all. After one camping trip I immediately ordered these in king size for our bedroom too. I sleep on my side and typically end up on my back in the middle of the night only to wake up and position myself back on my side. These pillows are perfect! I was so skeptical when I felt then right out of the box, but they give plenty of support for my neck and are nice and soft where I lay my head. I don’t wake up with neck pain anymore and I don’t feel like the pillow collapses on me at all. Now, I do firmly believe your mattress also makes a huge difference so your body type along with your mattress may make these pillows not great for you. But for both myself and my husband, these have been amazing and a game changer. Both side sleepers. Husband is tall and lanky. I’m 5’4” and 187 lbs. We sleep on a Casper Nova Hybrid at home and on a different plush hybrid mattress in our camper. I will buy these pillows over and over again if I ever need pillows again in the future. Once we finish our guest area downstairs, I’ll be buying them for that bedroom as well. They’re worth the money and I have seen them discounted down so many times on here that if you just wait a little bit you won’t even have to pay full price. If you made it this far in my review, congratulations. I ramble. Haha. Moral of the story: BUY THE PILLOWS.",positive

They tend to wash pretty clean and the elastic hasn't worn nor have they torn. They are still pretty dang comfortable after extended use and many wash cycles.

I've so far useful 300 of them and plan to ordere more. With 7 people in the house you use a lot of hangers. I don't understand why other people had problems with them breaking. I just make sure the arm is open and slide the shirt in, do the same with the other side pull the front and back down and hang them up. At first I was just trying to put the hanger in the arm and it didn't work because of the velvet, but that's what the hanger is supposed to do, hold your clothes on, that's why you buy them. The hangers really hold on to the cloths that's why you can't just shove them in the arm hole you have to open it up and then put the hanger through. They also sell clips to put on the hanger, then you can keep your outfit together. I think they are great. Holds onto the hanger and clothes nice and tight.

60,Home & Kitchen,Mellanni Bed Sheet Set,$34.97 - $49.97,4,"Here are things that you would not perhaps know unless you owned these exact sheets for six months like we have:

They are staying together well, no seams have split, no hanging threads.

They are thin, so they take up very little room in the laundry hamper and in the washer and dryer when balled up.

They are easily air dried on a rack or clothesline due to their thinness.

If one likes the feel of freshly washed, crisp sheets, these are not going to be your favorites; even washed and dried, they are never crisp, stiff, tight, or any of those kinds of words.

If one likes the feeling of soft sheets, silky, smooth, flowing, then these may be your favorites.

They seem colorfast; we bought the gray color and I cannot say they are any dingier or less vibrant than the day we bought them.

These microfiber-style, polyester sheets absolutely show oil stains more than cotton sheets, and it does not wash out. This may be particularly true of the darker colored sheet sets and pillowcases. If one uses body oils (e.g Neutrogena Body Oil), Vaselines, skin creams, hair gels, or eats potato chips in bed, you may not like how these sheets look after a few months. This bedding will have you believing that your spouse has ordered a bucket of KFC and ate it at a pajama party while you were at work; don't worry, your wife isn't having an affair with Col. Sanders...it's just the sheets.

These sheets have not shrunk and still can be easily placed on the bed. Even the fitted Mellanni sheet with elastic corners, unlike my usual cotton shrinky-dink sheets, doesn't snap up into my kisser while I'm making the bed. Thanks, Mellanni!

I hope that was of help to someone considering these sheets. Have a lovely slumber, friends.",positive
61,Home & Kitchen,Mellanni Bed Sheet Set,$34.97 - $49.97,5,"Let me start by saying I'm not a luxury sheet afficionado by any stretch and sheets couldn't make much of a difference to me honestly.

Well until I tried these....
They're soft, wrinkle-free, colorful, smooth and delicate.
I can lay on these all day and when I get up they're still smooth and without wrinkles.

Color selection is enormous and fits whatever your decor or style is while the colors are also very pleasant to look at and live with everyday....those sheets added a ton of life to my mostly white boring bedroom I had before👍

Each set comes with two pillow cases, stretchy mattress cover and the Queen (or whatever size you order) sheet set, I downsized my bed from Queen to Full recently and putting them on is still fairly quick even though I thought there'll be a problem with loose fitting, there wasn't👌

There are some drawbacks to this soft material too, I find that stains are a bit difficult to remove once they're there and sometimes I have to do two wash cycles to get the original color back but that can be ""fixed"" by changing the bedding more often, I'm planning to buy more sets of these anyway.

The other negative I found is not 100% consistent quality, my first set of Mocha (and sadly no longer available) sheets is a bit softer and has a higher thread count then my Teal set does, they evened out after several washes but initially each set could be distinguished easily, even with my eyes closed the Teal set felt as if just ironed in comparison to the quality of the Mocha one.

Overall I'm very happy with these sheets, sleeping is a pleasure again and I enjoy deciding which color I'm in the mood for this time, I'm definitely going to buy more sets 5 - stars !

P.S I did but 2 more sets (Striped silver and Violet) quickly found both are prone to stains but I do like the quality and the new colors just never get old👍",positive
62,Home & Kitchen,Mellanni Bed Sheet Set,$34.97 - $49.97,4,"Been waiting to write this review because I cannot stand the reviews that are posted where the person simply received the item and took it out of the packaging with no real world use to apply.

I've been using these EXTENSIVELY for 1.5 years. My sheet rotation is between two sets. Both of them are Mellani sheet sets.

I have washed these sheets probably more than 50 times. Here are my real world pros and cons:

Pros:
Affordability: At the time I bought them they were $5 cheaper than what they are going for today. Still even at today's price they are incredibly affordable for a set of sheets.

Softness: I need soft sheets. These are some of the lightest and softest sheets I've ever slept on.

Cool: I feel like these sheets sleep very cool. They do not get hot at all.

Cons:
Color Differences: The set only comes with two pillow cases. I have six pillows on my bed. So I ordered two more sets of (2) pillow cases. The four additional pillow cases that came were completely different colors than the original set. And it's not as if Mellani sent the wrong color code pillow cases, it just turns out that the ""light gray"" can vary extremely depending on what factory is shipping them. Mellani was awesome and sent me another set of pillow cases, but they too were different than any of the other ""Light Gray"" sheets or pillow cases. They explained to me that the color of the fabric varies from factory to factory so they cannot guarantee a color match.

And this isn't me being nit picky. The color differences are extreme. There's too much blue in one set, another set is too dark of a gray and another set has a greenish hue to it. So when I'm using six pillow cases they literally have three/four different colors going on.

Pilling: After about 1 year or so I started to nice the light gray fitted sheet began to pill. It has gotten pretty bad thereafter. Feels like there's grit/cat litter in the bed.

It's weird though. My other set (dark gray) doesn't pill at all. So again it probably comes down to different manufacturers of the sheets.

But for the price of a set of sheets, it's okay to buy another set 2 years later.

All in all I love these sheets. Highly recommend.",positive
63,Home & Kitchen,Mellanni Bed Sheet Set,$34.97 - $49.97,5,"Update:
Changed from 1 star to 5. Here's why:

I finally got ahold of the company (I think I had the wrong contact info) & they responded almost immediately from that email. They sent over new sheets very quickly. So they have lived up to their ""Mellanni Lifetime Promise"" & it is appreciated.

Now on to the quality of the sheets. Idk how to explain it but when you lay the flat sheet down and try to pull it more to one side, it feels like the other side is already tucked in. It's weird. Not bad at all - just weird. The sheets are smooth but not silky.

That said, these are currently my favorite sheets. I recently bought 3 or 4 new sheets to find ""the one"" and so far, these are the best. I usually sleep warm but I don't find myself soaked in sweat with these. I have pets who sleep with me & that means their hair is everywhere. With these sheets, I don't feel every. single. hair. It's frigging amazing. These sheets are extremely soft. I havent noticed any changed in texture from washing them. My cat has gotten his claw snagged, which sucks but I'm used to it. I am definitely going to buy another set of these in a different color. I have already recommended them to my brother & he has bought them for himself & likes it as well. He said that he likes the pockets on the fitted sheet since he doesn't usually use the flat sheet.

Older review:
Pros:
• Soft sheets.
• Beautiful color/print.

Cons:
• The pockets are on the fitted sheet.
• Two holes in the flat sheet. (See photos)
• Flat sheet was a QUEEN instead of CalKing. (See photos)
• Doesn't live up to the ""Mellanni Lifetime Promise"" (if you are not satisfied with your purchase at any point, for any reason, you can return it with no questions asked. That's the Mellanni promise...you don't even have to send back the product.)

I ordered cal king sheets. We unfortunately didn't check them before throwing them into the washer & didnt see the issues until it was too late. As soon as we took the sheets out of the package, we loved how they felt. So so soft. We were very excited to put these on our bed. I cant talk about how well they are while sleeping though. I did know ahead of time that the pockets were on the fitted sheet but I am mentioning it because well, we would have liked them on the flat sheet instead.

Amyways, we would have been happy with them regardless but as we were making the bed, I noticed a hole in the flat sheet. My fiancé thought it was small enough to ignore so we continue trying to make the bed. He kept pulling the sheet all the way to his side & not leaving me any to tuck in on my side. We went back & forth until I realized something wasn't right. I decided to look at the tag and saw it said QUEEN. What?! How did we get a queen flat & CalKing fitted sheet? At this point, doesnt matter about the hole or the pockets, we can't keep it. I decided to look at the sheets more closely and noticed another hole.

The problem is we ordered these sheets before the fires in CA. And then the fires got too close to our home for comfort. So the sheets got ignored and forgotten for a few weeks. It wasn't until we knew we were safe & didn't have to evacuate that we remembered the fresh & clean sheets we washed. But it was too late to return through Amazon. I decided to email the company before leaving a review because it seems like an easy fix - it wasn’t like we don't like the sheets because they sleep hot or some other reason (we don't know either way at this point), plus I saw their ""promise"".

Well, we still haven't heard back from the company a few weeks later. I didnt want to leave a bad review but I feel that will be the only way to get their attention since they havent replied to my email.

We have bought other sheets since then that we like. My fiancé would rather us get our money back. I would honestly be happy to get a new set to try but I believe we should definitely get a refund since we did not get the sheets we paid for. I

Just thought about: I do wonder how well the sheets hold up seeing as there were two holes in the ones we received. Either these were well-used sheets by someone else or they wear easily.",positive
64,Home & Kitchen,Mellanni Bed Sheet Set,$34.97 - $49.97,5,It just arrived today and as soon as I opened the package I immediately loved how soft it felt before even putting it on my bed!! With that said I can’t really leave feedback on the stain resistance or if it’s wrinkle-free because like anything that comes folded up there are some wrinkles. I’ve been looking for soft sheets and these are a great bang for the buck! Some people mentioned an odor on them so literally when I opened it I smelled it haha but personally they just smell like sheets. Can’t wait to hop in bed tonight! I would definitely recommend these and will probably buy more for my guest bed!,positive
65,Home & Kitchen,Mellanni Bed Sheet Set,$34.97 - $49.97,4,"Do you remember spending the night at Grandma's house? She had really soft sheets on the bed. They were old and had been washed thousands of times so they felt so soft and wonderful. The Mellanni microfiber sheets feel just like that. They are oh so soft and comfortable right out of the package. No need to wash them multiple times to get them soft.
They are very thin and I'm hoping this doesn't mean they tear or wear easily. I've had them about 1 month and they are my favorite sheets. I would have given 5 stars if the fitted sheet had a tag indicating head or foot of bed. Now that manufacturers have begun to tag the fitted sheet so you no longer have to guess if you're putting the sheet on correctly there is no excuse for any bed linen manufacturer not doing so.
But, for comfort these sheets are amazing!",positive

The hem on the top sheet is pretty plain but the pillowcases are very nicely detailed. Also the bottom sheet is kind of an awkward size but more than easy to just tuck under a bit more on the sides. I’d definitely recommend and buy again.,positive
69,Home & Kitchen,Mellanni Bed Sheet Set,$34.97 - $49.97,5,Love how deep the pockets fit!! It’s a beautiful color!! Didn’t take long to get to my doorstep!! That’s mainly why I was looking for new sheets cause my previous pair I had gotten somewhere else they would pop off as soon as I sat down when I raised the bed. However these do NOT do that and it’s amazing!! I am very particular about my sheets an having them straight before I get in bed I don’t like them bunched before I get in.,positive

So when I sent his bento box for his school lunches, she looked on disinterestedly, but then SHE got one and everything changed. She was so happy! I could tell it meant a lot to be remembered.
I like it bc she can now feel special at her OWN lunchtime, nothing will leak out since each compartment is sealed, and it’s just the right size for different sized foods, and if she wants to eat out at the park in the Texas heat, at least I know it will keep things the same temp they were packed in.

Variety is not one of our strengths right now. Getting him involved in packing his lunch has helped somewhat. And the fact that he LOVES the graphics and Bentgo, in general, is awesome! This summer is his first experience with summer camp and he’s required to send a lunch each day. After doing some research on our options and talking to some other parents, I decided to spend a little more and purchase the BentGo and coordinated lunch bag. Knowing he’s not going to be a huge fan of school lunches, camp gave us an opportunity for a trial run. So far, he’s only allowed two combos: ham sandwich with pringles, berries, spinach leaves and ranch; and chicken nuggets with ketchup, Mac and cheese, and berries. The cold foods have been fine with the little rocket ice packs in the bag. He said the Mac and cheese and nuggets got too cool. (But he still ate it all. 🤷) We haven’t tried anything liquidy other than the ranch and ketchup, but they both stayed put without leaking into any other compartments.

80,Home & Kitchen,TERRO T2502 Ready-to-Use Indoor Fruit Fly Trap with Built in Window,$5.89 - $66.37,4,"we had a bit of a fruit fly problem, so we got some zap traps that looked like they would work for $20~30 and a pair of these. the zap traps did not catch ONE fly, not fruit flies or any other kind of flying bug. maybe we got crappy zap traps, but the apples (and specifically these, not the raid apples, which kinda work but not as well) have been amazing.

here's how it's gonna go - you only order these when you're frustrated that you can't get rid of the flies, so you'll fill the trap, and then you get frustrated when you see flies land on the trap and crawl in and out of the holes and not fly into the solution. but after just an hour, we had a clump of flies in the solution, and after a day, a large number of them. we can't figure out where they're coming from and this is the most important thing you can do to fix your fruit fly problem, but in the meantime this has made our situation more bearable.

also, there are a few reviews complaining that you have to order more traps because they don't open. they do. it's just not intuitive to open them, but if you squeeze them at the seam you can get them open to clean the flies out (do this outside!) and if you wanted to add your own fluid you could.",positive
81,Home & Kitchen,TERRO T2502 Ready-to-Use Indoor Fruit Fly Trap with Built in Window,$5.89 - $66.37,3,"This product does not trap the flies whatsoever. The holes on the top are far too large and the flies can just buzz right out whenever they want. The only flies it actually kills are the ones who drown themselves! As a lure, the chemical (smells like mostly apple cider vinegar) works very well, so here's a breakdown of what you should do:

Step 1: Recon
-Examine the areas the flies congregate in. Generally this will be places like a produce basket, an under-the-microwave light, the garbage, a compost bucket, and the sink or other moist places.

Step 2: Address the congregation areas
-The flies are searching for food and water, especially anything sugary.

-If they are attacking your produce, determine if there's any old or broken produce and dispose of it. Place other produce in the refrigerator or inside enclosed (tupperware) containers. Clean the normal produce container inside and out, preferably with a dishwasher or soak in hot water. Clean the areas near it as well. Don't forget the onions and potatoes you might keep in a different spot! The oven is a great place to store things if you don't have alot of containers, but be careful that you don't bring the flies with you.
-If they are hanging out by the garbage, empty your garbage/recycling more frequently and clean the receptacles.
-If they are in the sink, try to wash the dishes immediately after use instead of leaving them for later.
-If they are in your dishwasher, try the above and hand wash for a week instead or run the dishwasher more frequently instead of letting dirty dishes sit.
- If you compost, leave the bucket outdoors for a while or stop composting while you deal with the infestation.

You get the idea.

Step 3: Lure and Kill
- If you bought these lures, place them in the biggest offending areas in a prominent place, preferably close to lighting (leave the lights on if you can). You will see the little devils sit right on top or slightly inside the lures. They may also hang out nearby. Now is your time to strike!
-Grab a bottle of windex and make sure it sprays a nice mist instead of a jet. Your best bet is to attack while they are grounded, but often the mist will weight their wings down and they will fall to the closest surface. It may take a second squirt but they will die rapidly in a pool of windex.
-Don't go crazy trying to get every single fly as they will settle down and congregate again in a little while.
-Be prepared to spray the windex whenever you approach the offending areas. If you're about to open the dishwasher, rip it open and spray right away! Same for garbage or the fridge.

This is a fool-proof way to commit fruit-fly genocide. They are going after essentially dirt and grime so get cleaning! Now is not the time to be eco-conscious and save that bruised apple. Use it, eat it, compost it, throw it away!

If you follow this guide your infestation should be under control within 72 hours and nearly/completely gone within a week. Be careful not to reoffend by going exactly back to old habits though!

Good luck!",fair
82,Home & Kitchen,TERRO T2502 Ready-to-Use Indoor Fruit Fly Trap with Built in Window,$5.89 - $66.37,4,"I live in Texas and had a persistent fruit fly problem after buying a bad batch of strawberries.

I placed the “apples” near their hang out spots where they wouldn’t be disturbed, then added the lure. It was astonishing - flys started swarming over IMMEDIATELY. After 24-48 hours, my problem was solved.

It’s hard to look inside, but there are easily a couple dozen flys in each, and I haven’t seen one since! I was concerned the flies would have trouble finding their way inside and actually get trapped, but it worked out.

I tried pairing it with those flat, yellow, sticky fly catcher’s but those worked horribly. Dry enough that only one that landed on it got caught.

I’d give this 5 stars if it was reusable and they sold the lure, but apparently they don’t. Not eco friendly and I’ll see if I can find a way to do so.",positive

To make it a little more annoying (and as several other reviewers have already mentioned), the company doesn’t sell the liquid alone “due to sanitary reasons”. The little apples are designed so well and even allows for the top to be removed easily, so it’s seems so wasteful to continue buying more and more of these plastic apples that I don’t need just to get more liquid.

You just squirt the bait into the little apple trap and then put the trap wherever you think the flies are breeding, like near the fruit or the sink. Within a couple of days, all the flies are gone! Hooray! The only downside is that if you need to bait the traps again later, you have to buy more bait and that costs more than buying the initial bait & traps. But it's not that big of a deal.

It works, it works fast, and puts a bug zapper to shame in efficiency.
So I’ll say this - if you’ve got a fruit fly problem, this is an EXCELLENT product for getting rid of them.

And for the bad. The refills.
Or really I should say, the non-existent refills.
These are plastic apples, with two plastic windows inside of them, that come with a little bottle of vinegar smelling liquid lure to add to the apples.

When I purchased these, I assumed I would use as needed, clean them out and store them to be used another day.
But nope. They don’t sell the lure. You’re supposed to just throw away these perfectly good, well designed plastic apples, and buy more of the traps so you can have more lure liquid.

I get it, it’s a cheap buy, but that’s not the point. Just a waste of plastic. I mean would you throw out a humming bird feeder once the liquid was gone?
Just seems silly and annoying.

110,Home & Kitchen,TERRO,$12.28 - $31.97,5,"I had an occasional ant or two showing up in my office and could not track down where they were coming from. Every few minutes i'd feel one crawling up my leg, I'd pick it off me, look everywhere on the floor and find no others. It's like they were coming right up through the floor or something but they never revealed their entryway to me.
Got some tarro liquid gel bait, placed against a wall under my desk, and the next day I had a line of ants coming from somewhere across the room, all the way over to that bait. Suckers! I moved the bait to their entryway and they've been all over it for about 5 days now.
I also placed bait in my bathroom where there were some ants. Put it near where they were scavenging but these ants must not be part of the same group because they ignored it for 2 days until I put it right up in their faces, then they swarmed it. These ones liked to swim in it though and clogged up the entrance to the bait. Had to scrape out the dead body clump there to make it a little more attractive to future ants who may not like the idea of climbing over a pile of their dead family to get to the food.
Looking at the bait over these past few days, it seems many ants just get stuck in the gel and ultimately die. I'm not sure how much of this is actually making it back to the nest. Activity around the bathroom bait is definitely slowing though. Lots of ants hanging around but don't seem to be doing much, almost like they're drunk. They brought in reinforcements too, some at least 2-3 times bigger than what I usually saw there, but they too are stumbling around like drunkards now. The office ants are still pretty active though...they too seem to just get stuck and die but have greater numbers.
Overall, the bait is working! Watching it work is nearly as good as watching a Netflix series.

UPDATE: It's been about 11 days or so and the office ants don't seem to be slowing down. I put 3 baits there initially, and they slowly filled up with dead ants (1 was even completely dry) so, I decided to replace those with 3 fresh baits.
The other 2 ant locations I used this bait on worked really well and only took a few days to see a slowdown and eventual end to their activity there, but these office ants are apparently sturdier and have greater numbers.
Hopefully these 3 fresh baits are enough to finish off the office ants. Again, not sure on how much of this gets back to the nest... They all just seem to get stuck and die inside the bait. Will report back on progress.

UPDATE 2: Been just over 2 weeks now and the office ants are finally slowing down. I'm gonna conclude this room took longer simply because there were a lot more of them there than the other rooms. Eventually, they'll all die but you gotta be persistent and replace the baits when they inevitably turn into graveyards full of bodies. Probably another week and this group will be done for good.",positive
111,Home & Kitchen,TERRO,$12.28 - $31.97,5,"I very rarely write reviews which is kind of stupid because I usually read reviews prior to getting certain products. Therefore I guess I will start now, hoping I can help someone decide wether or not this product is for them. Before you read this long review I want to let you know this is the BEST product I have ever used.

Before I tell you about how AMAZING this product was I will tell you what kind of Ant 🐜 problem I had. Maybe someone can relate.
I have a parrot and he is in a room that is near a window. With all the different types of food he eats and with the warmer weather that we started having in my area (NJ) I started seeing ants outside. That’s when I started seeing some ants coming in from the bottom left corner of the frame of our window. I have never had an ant issue with the 17 years I live hear. Even having my parrot and all the amounts of food he eats. For some reason last year during the spring time is when I saw these crazy little annoying bugs come in my house.
These ants seemed to be a different type of ant. One I have never seen before. They were small but the minute you go near them they would run away or scatter away super fast. I have an exterminator on my block and he told us they were sugar ants. What the hell is a sugar ant? Lol. Well I was told that these ants hide out in your shower and in the kitchen because of the sugary foods around. Why are they found in a bathroom is beyond me. But I looked it up after what he said and everything he told us was what I read on line about “sugar ants”. I mentioned that last year I had this problem and they were found behind the faucet in our shower. That’s another story. Anyway, before having an exterminator come into my house, I figured I would try to resolve the problem myself. So before buying this “AMAZING PRODUCT”, I purchased all the “Raid” products that come in the square plastic containers. The ones that come in white or grey containers. I put the Raid traps by the window and where else I thought they might come in. I actually tried the mixture of vinegar, sugar and water concoction that was told on line to use for these ants. But nothing worked. I doubt an ant even went to these traps because near my window they would go around those traps. I was getting frustrated because I skeeve bugs. And I was afraid of an exterminator coming in with my parrot living here. I wasn’t taken that chance of him dying with the chemicals. Anyway after coming to a dead end with the Raid traps I began reading and reading on so many products just to find a worthy product. That’s when I came across this product. It was very different than the normal products that are used to kill ants. So I figured why not, let me give it a try. I received my order really fast and was anxious to use them. After reading all the directions these baits were very easy to use. It comes in a thick clear rectangular container. To open it, it Reccomended to hold it up right and twist off the plastic top until it snaps off. It was a little tough for me to snap off the top like it says on the package. Therefore I used a pair of scissors to open the trap. Word of advise, if you need a pair of scissors to open your product, just make sure to keep the trap upright so the liquid doesn’t pour out. After opening the trap, I then placed this trap about 3-4 inches away from the bottom corner of the window. Right where I saw the ants coming in. They scurried away from me at first, but the minute I put this trap down it was shocking!! No joke. I was shocked to see all these ants go running toward the opening of this trap. The trap actually attracted more ants to come out of hiding to eat this food (crazy). I actually spilt a little bit on my windowsill and some ran to that and got stuck. But what was amazing to me was after I put the trap down and watching these ants go to it, it was shocking to see them run right back out of the corner of the windowsill. It was crazy. I just watched for a few minutes and to see them either get trapped inside the trap or grab some of the food in the trap and run back outside or wherever they came from. And by the end of the day they were gone. It’s about 2 weeks now since I only used one trap and I have yet to see another NASTY ANT!! Wahooo!!!! They are gone.

This product is BY FAR THE BEST ANT PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED IN MY LIFE!! This is noooo joke. Therefore you can count on me to continue to purchase and use this product for any ant problem that might arise again. I will never buy a different type of ant trap again. No matter how popular people feel the “Raid” products might be. The sprays are only wonderful for the outdoors but for the inside the “Raid” products are definitely not as effective as this product is. I actually gave my neighbor 2 traps and after a day or two they were gone by him as well. These traps are crazy how wonderful they work. I swear by this product and I know if you purchase these traps you will too. I will never buy another kind of ant traps again. These are the BEST kind of ant traps on the market by far!!! And mind you, I AM NOT making any kind of commission from this company for this product review. I am just sooo happy my ant issue is gone for now. Sooo, if you want to get rid of these annoying, nasty bugs “FAST,” then purchase these traps. And I promise you, you will be so happy you did.",positive
112,Home & Kitchen,TERRO,$12.28 - $31.97,5,"Ok, haven’t written a review in a while as I’m usually very descriptive and detailed but will try to keep this one simple. I can’t be 100% sure that it was this product that did it alone as we triple attacked. Allow me to explain.

We had a big birthday party for our kids and it took a while until family who stayed with us along with their kids eventually left. Bottom line the house wasn’t exactly immaculate but any standards. The little tiny black ants showed up out of nowhere and had a steady stream in and out of the house by way of what appears to be a space in the deck door jam that leads into our kitchen. They went along the base molding up the cabinets and asking the granite counter at the edge of the wall in the kitchen all the way across and over to the other side of our stove where we keep a small garbage can for our compost items. But they weren’t drawn just to that I’m sure.

Anyhow, I’ve crushed them, wiped them away, and sprayed vinegar. The later worked for maybe a day or so each time we tried.

Enough was enough so I bought this and Amdro Ant Block Home Perimeter Ant Bait, 1LB 8oz (24 Oz). Put that outside and swept it under the base of the vinyl siding and doorway around where the ants were coming in. Inside I see these traps up. Only reason for giving it one star less on of the features is that the tabs don’t easily come off and literally without my forearms every morning. Note to their QC/CS peeps, these should be perforated to make it easier for customers or tell them to cut them off.

Anyhow, I wasn’t playing song and laid out three along the counter and two in the floor from the doorway to the counter.

Bam - the triple play combo worked in a single day. I haven’t removed the traps over the past three or four days done I set them just to be sure. Love the immediate results.

Will see what happens after I remove them… as in will they come back.",positive
113,Home & Kitchen,TERRO,$12.28 - $31.97,5,"While these are amazing, there are some inherent issues.

1. It takes time for the ants to collect the goods and head back to poison the colony. You will have a massive string of ants that you'll just need to deal with. It takes a few days.

2. If you don't pick these up after ants are gone, you will have another set of ants that come to find the poison and you'll need to repeat step 1.

3. There is still poison left and there's no way to package up or save for later. You'll need to find another spot to deploy until the liquid is gone.

4. It's liquid. It can leak. Hold it properly and carefully.

5. It's not a permanent solution. It's to fix problem areas and is not a preventative.

As far as pros go,

1. The dogs and cat don't seem to be interested.

2. You can see the results with the massive graveyard inside the liquid.

3. 12 come in a box - and you wont need that many at first (unless you have multiple problem areas (I did).

Overall I would buy again, but it's not a solution in itself to prevent ants from coming back.",positive
114,Home & Kitchen,TERRO,$12.28 - $31.97,5,"So, I just moved into my apartment about a month ago. Living in Wyoming and all of its temperature fluxes recently I started noticing these little buggers coming out OF MY CARPET. Now, I have a fear of ants and small bugs alike, so as soon as I saw a small cluster of them, I immediately took to amazon to find something that works. In the first two pictures I uploaded, that was after roughly 4 hours after I laid two traps down. Obviously extremely shocked at the sheer amount I had just discovered compared to the small cluster I saw the morning before, I grabbed a couple more traps and readied my defenses. I now had three traps ready to battle these little shits. In the second two pictures you’ll see just what happened with having three down. EVEN MORE KEPT COMING. Those pictures were taken roughly an hour after I set the third one down, so now, roughly 5-6 hours after first setting these ants up for failure, I had lured out HUNDREDS and boy were they hungry. Upon my moms advice i did decided to vacuum up some of the stragglers so i didn’t have to keep looking at all of them crawling around (also, I thought those in the traps were dead). Right when I started that, BOOM, they all started fleeing from my vacuum suction. The ants in the traps were ALIVE. So , obviously freaked out by this even more and after vacuuming up probably 200 ants, I left some stragglers so they had the chance to go back and poison their queen. I then laid two more traps and essentially created an arch of traps to keep them consolidated to one place (they are on the edge of my kitchen and i don’t want them spreading). So now, 5 traps down and 7 hours later, the ants still can not resist the delicious goodness Terro puts in these traps. Now, I have only spent a single day with these and seemingly only lured them out to feed, BUT i am hopeful these will begin working and I will leave the 5 traps overnight and view the situation in the morning - HOPEFULLY I will have successfully infiltrated the queen and killed her along with the colony. Obviously the company recommends a couple weeks to see results, but based on what I see now along with others reviews, I don’t think they stand a chance. I will update in a few days with the ant infiltration among my carpet and I hope it’s a good situation by then.
UPDATE:
So here we are, about 24 hours later and oh. my. god. these traps work. When I came and looked this morning there are far less ants than yesterday! In the last two photos I added, you’ll see just how many ants there are now and boy is it less than before. Now, I’m unsure if the lesser number means that I’ve successfully infiltrated the colony and killed them off, or if their tummies are just full from eating so much - either way, I don’t see nearly as many today. The ones still present are certainly moving slower than before, my guess is these Terro traps are penetrating their stomach and killing them off (this is what I hope). Overall, with this intense decrease in ants after only about 24 hours, I am impressed and will certainly be ordering more as Spring rolls through and I’m sure they’ll be back if I haven’t killed them all. I will update once more in a few days as well just to give my final thoughts but so far, I’m sticking with the 5/5 stars! I also have someone coming to spray in a few days, but if these are working I may just send them away!",positive
115,Home & Kitchen,TERRO,$12.28 - $31.97,5,"I don't write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to follow up on this product. I'd been fighting this little sugar ants for a month. Tried all the natural products first, cinnamon, peppermint, other non chemical sprays. They'd work for a day or two and then they'd be back. Tried borax and diatomaceous earth, they worked a little better but they still returned. Got this product, put one down at the base of kitchen cabinets where the dog couldn't get to it. Within a couple hours, noticed a steady flow of hundreds of tiny ants getting the bait and back inside the wall. About three hours later, they were gone!! Never to return. It's been a month, no more issue. Repeated the same process in my den and again a few hours later, ants were gone and haven't returned. I followed a tip from another reviewer - I put a small piece of foil down with painters tape holding the edge down, tipped the bait slightly to put a drop out on the foil. Boy did they flock to that. Anyway, the foil/tape made cleanup easy as the bait is sticky.",positive
116,Home & Kitchen,TERRO,$12.28 - $31.97,5,"I had to do 2 rounds of this (Borax goop) treatment on my kitchen counter. I thought they were gone but it took 2 weeks of invasion and patience to wait it out. So much stressing, but finally no ants. I took up 1 of the 2 packets. left on a 3 day trip and came back to ants everywhere ..ignoring the packet I had left. There was still liquid in it so I pour a drop out to lure the ants, put out a new fresh one and let it sit another 2 weeks. Again an invasion... waited 2 more weeks but see no more ant. So that took a full month and I am leaving one of these on my countertop for any that may come looking. (These were tiny ants) FYI.. do not bother to twist off the top to open a packet. I'd already read how hard it was to do that, so just have a scissor ready and drop 1drop and lay the packet there, no ants ever went inside for long. You need to pour some so they definitely partake and take it back to the whole bed that will die. They circle thick around the poured out dot of goop. This stuff is majorly tacky and it cleans up easily with hot water.",positive
117,Home & Kitchen,TERRO,$12.28 - $31.97,5,"we just moved in to our new house less than a month ago and almost immediately we had ants coming in to all rooms as if our house was going to bust at the seams. even places with no food. and we keep everything in our pantry pretttyyy sealed up and make sure we clean up messes and run the vacuum daily. AND we used our pest control spray that we usually use. and did all the other tips with vinegar etc etc.

BUT THEY STILL CAME IN RELENTLESSLY EVERYWHERE. This picture is from our master bedroom CLOSET, and we placed them in 5 other places -basically each room in the house where we knew there where secret entry portals somewhere. I spent the whole day finding all their secret portals while waiting for these to be shipped.

after reading like every review I knew to cut off with scissors and that they’d be kind of messy and spill out so I used paper towel /cardboard. and actually spilling it out helped since the design doesn’t really make sense.

after several hours they were almost gone and by morning, zilch. now it’s afternoon and still none!

we had made an appt for pest control to come Monday but honestly if we don’t see anymore this weekend we might cancel and see how it goes.

PS- it’s a GOOD thing if they all start coming in droves, that mean you found the secret portal and they’re gonna take it all back to their colonies. it’ll get worse before it gets better. I’m surprised ours went away so fast with how many we’ve had over this past month we lived here.",positive

119,Home & Kitchen,TERRO,$12.28 - $31.97,5,"So far so good. Easy to use, just cut the tip off. Place it down and a few hours later the ants are swarming it. The next day they are gone. I get t hose little crazy ants, that don't go in a line but scout all over the place and you can never tell where they re coming from! so frustrating. I drop one of these down and leave it. A hour later there is a black mass there. I'd say place it on a piece of paper or cardboard or something, because it gives me a tiny stain on my carpet when they leave with t he bait, but otherwise not bad? And honestly, by the next day not a ant is seen. They seem to last a while too, which is nice. And t his pack had a lot in it, so when ants show up much later, I put a fresh one down and don't worry.

I have two cats, and so far they are not attracted to these nor do they bother them. I tend to put one down by a wall and prop a tall book or binder or something in front, or even cardboard, against t he wall, so it's like a hidden tent. But even then they don't seem t o care, and it's been safe so far!

For those who have witnessed or gone through child birth, you know what a mess I arrived to. For those who haven't, suffice to say there are many different types of fluids and a lot of them. Let's just say I was fully expecting to be purchasing a new mattress. To my amazement, once I'd bagged our sheets and this mattress pad, our mattress was perfectly fine. I bought another one immediately and will continue to use this brand as long as it exists.

I started using them when I had my son and I never had to worry about my mattress getting wet. I'm talking spilled bottles, a diaper not being as absorbent as one would hope, a full glass of tea accidently spilled on the bed.

Every
Single
Time
I took the sheets and this mattress protector off the bed and my mattress was completely and totally dry! Yes!!!

For washing, wash on delicate cycle, no fabric softener and definitely dry on either air dry or low. I made the mistake one time of drying with towels on high - did not turn out well. My fault, so I can't blame the manufacturer. So, I just bought a new one.

My advice, if you're potty training, get 2 of these. That way if your little one has an accident, you can take the wet one that's on the bed off and put a nice clean and dry new one on the bed... just in case it's a 2 accident night 😉

And... no worries about feeling like you're sleeping on plastic grocery store bags. It's very quiet. I only noticed the sound of it the first night or two and I would imagine it just got broke in and then no more noise. Let it air out for a day before putting it on your bed to get rid of any plastic smell (I sprayed mine with f e b r e e z e).

Definitely recommend and would buy again. Thank you SafeRest!!!",positive

I hope I’m not the only one who’s experienced this before. The mattress protector worked really well to absorb the pee. Absolutely no damage to my mattress, didn’t smell much at all, and dried relatively quickly. You would think with that much liquid some of it would soak through but nothing soaked through at all.

Before we were able to get her medication for her incontinence, this mattress protector was a huge help. Her urine never reached the mattress. Big, huge puddles that never touched the mattress.

I was nervous when I received this mattress protector because it felt thinner compared to others I’ve tried. I was very surprised to say the least when it came time to see if my mattress was spared.

I love how the corner pockets are nice and deep that keep it from bunching up through the night. I’m one of those that has to fight with fitted sheets (even with the suspenders) every day. This protector is also not crunchy or plastic-y like many others.

The day finally came when my cat slept with me through the night and I rolled over and got a whiff of the destructive pee that all cat parents fear. It wasn’t very damp leading me to believe that the accident happened much earlier. I took off all the sheets and slammed my face into the mattress to assess the damage. To my delightful surprise I could not smell any leakage. ANY!! Promptly after that I purchased another so I would be able to do laundry without having to protect the naked clean mattress.

130,Home & Kitchen,"LuxClub 6 PC Bamboo Sheet Set 18 inch Deep Pocket Sheets Eco Friendly, Wrinkle Free, , Moisture Wicking, Fade Resistant, Silky, Earth Friendly Product",$27.95 - $56.99,5,"I’ve always purchased high thread count cotton sheets until… the last set I bought very quickly tore. So as I was shopping for a new brand, I found myself on the Amazon page for these sheets. Bamboo. Hmmmm I had never heard of “bamboo sheets.” It said they’re soft but really that had to be compared to the everyday cotton sheets - not my high thread count ones. But the prices I faced on the high thread count cotton sheets from brands that I had never heard of were just too much considering that I’d be risking a do-over if the quick tear. Yes, I was ready for a change. And I kept coming back to the page for these bamboo sheets - primarily because of all the colors that were available but because I kept seeing the word soft. Well, I usually am the one in my circles that is first to try new things so oh well let’s do it. Little did I know, that I would get a set of sheets that would be just as soft as my 750 thread count cotton sheets but be at least twice as durable. But that’s exactly what reality has proved to be! I was anxious to get the sheets and when they arrived, I opened them immediately to see if they were soft. Oh yes, they were! And that evening when I got home from work, I couldn’t wait to tear down my bed covering and put them on and see how they looked and how well they fit my king-sized bed and how they would feel. I have sensitive skin so the smooth silliness matters a lot to me. I SUFFER from painful sebhorreic dermatitis at times and, when my skin breaks out, it BURNS.

The sheets looked absolutely fancy as tic when I put them on my bed. Indeed, because of the color, my bedding now looked masculine and when I rubbed the sheets, they felt as soft to the touch as they had earlier when I touched them in the packaging. The next test would be the pillow cases and I put them on and threw the blankets on the bed and jumped in. I felt soaked in luxury. I read a review that said VERY low class or something like that. I don’t know what that reviewer is accustomed to but I don’t Malibu luxury condos with somebody catering to my every need but these sheets feel PLENTY classy to me. They fit my deep mattress, they’re smooth and soft and they don’t irritate my skin. I guess it’s true that they don’t cost over $200 so maybe that’s the class that’s missing. Hmmmm I can handle this low-class life if that’s the case! And that’s why I just ordered my second set of these sheets in the eggplant color. And seeing that review it’s the point of shopping for my second set is what motivated me to post this review. Because when you find a great product that’s not reviewed because of its qualities or the lack thereof and has phrases like “low class” or such, you know that that person - or competitor more likely - is using emotion not fact to steer people away from a truly great product. And I want this product to be priced as reasonably as it is so it’s my job to tell you how good it is - based on my objective experience and being upfront about my biases and my risks - as I have done.

So if class to you means you have to spend $200 or more on a set of sheets…. Well these may not be so classy but maybe you should try sleeping on a lower class sheet. You may find that there’s something to be said about these VERY not classy sheets.

But if class to you means delivering an extremely high-quality product that produces results equivalent to those produced by pricier - or classier - products and doing so at a price-point that a, shall we say, not so classy person can afford…… then I’m POSITIVE you will find these sheets to be pretty damn classy! And if you’re thinking I’ll sleep on anything, I assure you, that’s just not the case. I’m the guy who just order a weighted blanket for my bed because that’s how much I value a good night’s classy sleep.

In summary, just forget the reviews that make you FEEL one way or the other. Listen to the facts. The sheets fit perfectly. They’re soft and smooth. I haven't smelt any bad odors from them and I’m pretty sure I haven’t had a nightmare caused by them - as I haven’t had a memorable nightmare. I tumble in my sleep as evidenced by the fact that the previous sheets I used were torn. And yet the sheets aren’t wrinkled and are still tucked neatly under the mattress just as I had put them. That’s also why I’m ordering a weighted blanket. I like style - which is why I ordered the one color which I’m reviewing and why I’m back to purchase a different color. And I think you’ll love these sheets too once you sleep on them and wake up feeling good and then realize how much better you feel when you see that you now have money in your wallet to go out for a nice dinner because you didn’t spend $200 on sheets that you get here for about $35. Enjoy your purchase whatever you choose to do! Cheers!",positive

Bamboo? Really? But hey - the price was pretty good and I needed deep pocketed sheets, so I figured I would give them a try. I'm very glad that I did.

These sheets were exactly as described, fit perfectly and were soft pretty much out of the package. Not flannel soft, but like good cotton sheets soft. I washed them once and they got softer. They're typically cool to the touch and I'm one of those people that sweats when I sleep hard. These sheets are absorbent, but after a few days start to show discoloration from the perspiration. I put them through a duration test and by the end of a second week they were funky, splotchy, and had stretched to where they didn't stay on the mattress well. Washed them, dried them, and they went right back to being like new.

If you change sheets weekly, these will do a great job for you and the price is pretty darned good. If you're one of those people that only change your sheets when they're ready to get up and walk away on their own (like college students away at school - you know who you are), you'll find these know that after a week or so these will look and smell like you're a slob - but they dry out pretty quickly if you pull the covers back and let them air out. They'll stay soft and comfortable, but you'll be pulling the fitted sheet down every morning...

I do not get paid for reviews- I’m a retired momma of many children and now a Nana to many grand babies. This is just from me. 🙂
My eldest daughter surprised me with making my room look nice- and the sheets were the icing on the cake. Not only did I get to sleep in my own bed…. But these sheets are soft, cool, deep pocket and I chose such a pretty color. The Queen set came with a flat, a deep pocket, fitted sheet and four standard pillowcases. That night- I kept moving my legs like I was doing the scissors exercise/ just to feel the softness. These are well made, no strange odors, we washed them prior to use and they are easy to wash and dry. I’m definitely buying more! These are a treat! Highly Recommend!!",positive

I read the numerous great compliments and of course read the ones that were not so complementary. They were a good price on sale and most of the comments on how soft they were, wrinkle free, and most of all that they were cool, made me purchase these. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. I washed and dried them and they came out of the dryer just fine. Put them on the bed and very little wrinkles. Did I mention how soft they are? Very very soft and light. I am very hot natured and live in Houston Texas which is brutal right now. I suffer from night sweats. I cannot say these are miracle sheets but I can say I’ve had the best sleep in a while because the sheets were indeed cooling and breathable as well as very soft and luxurious feeling . I have sheets that I paid hundreds of dollars for that ate 100% 1,000+ Thread’ ‘hotel’ quality cotton. Those sheets I could take out of the dryer as soon as the dryer stopped and they still looked like they had been rolled in a ball for two or three weeks. Yes they were indeed high-quality combed cotton, but they were heavy and not cooling at all. These sheets I gave a a 5+ rating in every area. I see some comments about the piping is not as pretty or luxurious as it should be or maybe the edging and hem should be thicker and better quality. I found no problems with the stitching. The piping was fine but most of all they gave me great comfort and a good nights cooling sleep and that’s all that matters. I am very happy and satisfied with my purchase.I’m thrilled that the sheets come in a large assortment of colors because I’m going to be buying many more.",positive

Gone are the days of being too hot and risking my toes by sticking my leg out from beneath the blankets. I feel like I'm checking into a five star hotel every night when I go to bed. Great for couples too. My spouse refuses to come near me at night now because it might disrupt the ""cocoon"" of sheets around them. It's impossible for me to focus at work because all I'm thinking about all day is getting to bed so I can be underneath these sheets. Mornings are now my least favorite part of the day because it involves removing myself from the luxurious softness of my bed. And the extra deep corners of the fitted sheet means I no longer have to attach suspenders to them like some sort of amateur bed owner.

Before this, I was a night owl. Now every time I crawl into bed I'm out within ten minutes. It's almost hypnotic. I haven't slept this good since the womb. I have to set extra alarms now to make sure I make it to work on time. It changes very little. These sheets own me now. They are too comfortable for their own good.

I do recommend washing them before immediately diving in to the realm of ultimate comfort. I followed the instructions on the tag and threw in a few lavender scent beads and the result is heavenly. It also gets rid of that cardboard insert smell sheets get sometimes. But who am I to judge if you just throw them on your bed and call it quits? Go make your bed and lie in it. That's what I plan on doing.",positive

I’d never had bamboo sheets before, and some of the negative reviews were bothering me (have to learn to ignore them!).
I have washed everything, including the 2 extra pillowcases I bought, and they all came out with no defects.
I used to only put on the bottom fitted sheet, since it was easier. I sleep on top of the bedspread with a soft blanket. But I put these on, and cuddled up under the sheet, which is perfect for the hot weather.
If there is one thing I wasn’t happy with is that the fitted sheet pocket is not as deep as I would like, and the elastic that goes under the mattress is thin, and seems like it might slip off easily. We will see. I’ve only had these on my bed for a few days! So far I’ve enjoyed sleeping under the sheets, something I haven’t done for a couple of years!",positive

I used a mild detergent and plain vinegar as a fabric softener. I dried them together on low heat and everything came out perfectly. I wouldn't suggest a a chemical based fabric softener because it will most likely leave stains on the fabric meanwhile vinegar doesn't leave a smell and will break up any oils the fabric might absorb from your hair or skin.

Just gently moving the liner to the left or right to adjust it can knock the magnets off completely. Also the magnet pouches are either coming apart slightly, or weren't water tight in the first place. A couple have water in them now. The actual liner is fine, it's not like industrial strength but it's thick enough without losing too much feel. It feels durable enough without being a stiff board of plastic that you gotta fight just to adjust.

Overall fine, would have given it possibly 5 stars if not for the magnets.",positive

This year we dropped the ball and didn’t order in time so she had the option of getting her normal pottery barn things after the start of school, or getting something different so she chose to get something different this time.

After years of trying to put our bentgos into the PB lunchboxes and having zero extra room for a water bottle or juice box or anything, so I’d end up SHOVING her water bottle into the side water bottle pocket and she could never get it back in after lunch. This lunchbox is amazing. I can fit her bentgo (she uses both the kids version and the bentgo fresh) with a juice box or water bottle inside and another snack, with 2 cold packs. And even if I had to add more than that, the water bottle pocket is a soft mesh with a drawstring bungee so it’s SO easy to get bottles in and out.

The normal handle has a clip so you can clip it on a backpack (a feature we thought we’d miss from not having the PB lunchboxes, so we love that) and it also has the front handle so you can carry the lunchbox flat, so if you have a bento inside, the stuff won’t get as sloshed around and stuff. Sooo nice.

Not to keep comparing it to PB, but that’s what I have to compare it to. I am BLOWN AWAY by the quality compared to PB. You can tell just by touching it, the material is nicer and will hold up much longer, the handles seem better made, and the insulation is DRASTICALLY better, like it makes me actually sad I spent almost $50 each time I got one of those stupid things and just spent $24 on this or whatever the price was, and it’s so much better.",positive

If your kid isn't patient enough and just jams it in, the edges of the rover are likely to tear up the inner silver liner of the lunch box. Other than the tight fit, this thing is gonna work like a dream. (Fingers crossed it may stretch some as the school year goes on.) Nice and sturdy. Good insulation. Lots of carry options. Space for an ice pack and some extra snacks, and the drink carrier on the side.

180,Home & Kitchen,Simple Modern Reusable Wide Mouth Stainless Steel Flask Thermos,$14.99 - $56.99,5,"So far this is only the second day I've had this water bottle, but I had purchased one previously for my husband in the 32oz size and knew it was a good water bottle! I also have the galaxy simple modern tumbler and love it, so when my c0ntigo fit bottle developed a large dent in the bottom and would teeter and fall over, I knew it was time to get a new one and was ready to get myself a simple modern bottle! I had a really hard time deciding which color/size to get, as I'm used to 32oz, but wanted the variety of lids the 40oz provides, and I do come close to running out of water at the gym, so I went ahead and got the 40oz size. There are so many lovely options to choose from with color and print that I had a really hard time deciding! I was torn between the lavender mist and sea glass sage, and ultimately went with the sea glass sage because it is such a LOVELY color! It is 10x more beautiful in person, and the fact that it is more matte/pastel, I LOVE that! The lid being the same exact color makes the bottle look so much more sleek, like it is high-end. When I look at this bottle sometimes I see grey, sometimes blue and sometimes green. It is such a unique and eye-catching color, im in love with it. Now as far as being leak-proof and all that, it pretty much is. But you have to make sure the cap is screwed on tightly or some droplets can sneak out. The bottle is pretty big, and looks giant in my hands, but i love that because it means i have to refill less, and yes, it keeps your water cold for quite a while! I mean, dont expect it to hold ice all day or anything, especially if you dont fill the bottle up with ice first. But it does do a great job at keeping things cold! All in all, super impressed and hoping it stays that way. I'll update if anything changes but so far I'm just in love with it!",positive
181,Home & Kitchen,Simple Modern Reusable Wide Mouth Stainless Steel Flask Thermos,$14.99 - $56.99,5,"To start off, I will say that it doesn’t appear to keep liquids ice cold for insanely long periods of time, that said, I love this water bottle. This is a great and affordable alternative if you are looking for a large double insulated hydro flask type bottle.

I love the options for lid types and it’s super easy to clean. Plus it looks so nice!

I have a hydro flask that has a really hard angle at the top of the bottle which makes it super difficult to clean. The Simple Modern bottle has a nice sloped angle inside the upper rim of the bottle which makes cleaning so much easier.

I don’t love that it’s hand wash only, but that is expected especially with a super affordable double walled water bottle.

Bonus review of the company: I had received my bottle with a slight chip in the enamel. I reached out to simple modern’s support and they sent me another bottle right away. That 2nd bottle came and was obviously dropped during transport and had a pretty decent dent on the bottom. I was bummed thinking that was it for getting a proper replacement, but I reached out just in case and they instantly sent another to make it right. I am still waiting for the delivery, but I am so impressed with how easy it has been to work with the company. I have no doubts that I will receive a bottle in perfect condition, but will update the review if not.",positive

Picked it up as a backup to my usual for a trip to Europe because I wanted one to keep in the car. Great design, keeps ice almost completely frozen even in a hot car. Absolutely no complaints about the bottle itself.

However. It is vacuum insulated and the one I got did come with a straw lid. Both of those mean you need to unscrew the cap to release built up pressure when taking it on a plane. I forgot about that little issue and am now typing this on my phone mid-flight while half-soaked. Water spurted a good six inches in the air before I managed to flip the top down again. Great indication of a good seal, but really not the kind of demonstration you need. Learn from my mistake. Unscrew the cap (carefully!) before using the straw if you take it on a plane.",positive

It's also durable, and holds up to frequent washing. Its skinny and tall, holds the same amount of water as a plastic disposable water bottle (as a point of reference), and it fits perfectly into my wrangler cup holder too, if that's helpful to anyone. Just snug enough to be confident its not going anywhere, even with the top and doors off at 70 mph. If you're on the fence, don't be, it's worth every penny.

We purchased the bottles for us and our kids as they have multiple varieties, colors, and sizes.
I replaced mine with a new one because it had taken too many falls and wasn't keeping the water cold as long as it used to. The water would be warm after about 12 hours. Usually, if the bottles are filled with ice and water, the water will stay cold with ice for 24-36 hours, and just cold up to 48 hours (If your are not drinking the water and refilling it).
The water bottles look great, they can take a beating and still keep liquids cold.

We highly recommend them.",positive

The only issue was that I drink a lot of water so I was having to refill it a lot. When I lost it, I wanted to go up one size for less refills. I accidentally went up 2 sixes thought and bought the 32oz. The only thing I liked was that I had to refill way less (even when I waited overnight, the water was still always ice cold). However, that size was too fat for my hand to wrap around it comfortably & it was also really hard to fit in a bag. FINALLY after losing that one, I got the 22oz and it’s PERFECT! (I feel like Goldilocks writing this lol) but for real, it has the same circumference as the 18oz, but it’s taller so it can fit more water (less refills!) As w the other 2, the leak-proofing could use some work, but as long as you don’t keep it laying on its side or upside down, you’ll be fine lol. Also, the Nebula design is GORGEOUS!!

My first Simple Modern bottle lasted me about 4-5 years, and it still works great! It is a 32oz straw lid in the color Seaside. Despite its age and use, my husband took it out for golf ~8 hours, and when he returned home, the ice was still rattling inside! I bought a second S|M bottle on Prime Day, a 40oz in Blush. It came with 3 styles of lids, but the straw lid is my favorite. The bottle insulates amazingly well, I have had ice in this bottle stay solid for almost two days. My only complaint is the straw lid can be hard to clean around the spout, where it pivots. I have not researched the best way to clean it, but a white film can start to accumulate around the spout, even where I do not put my lips. The picture does not really show it because it is my new bottle. It's amazing quality for the price. I would love to buy the S|M beverage tumbler once I can drink coffee again.",positive

I have been equally as impressed with the cute blue water bottle I received. It absolutely keeps my water cool all day, is easy to hold and drink from and doesn't leak all over the place. The only thing that I would change is it won't fit into my average-sized cup holder in my car, but I'm sure if I had gotten a smaller size that wouldn't be an issue. I'm not sure if the water bottles are dishwasher safe but I have always put the coffee cups in the dishwasher and other than some light color fading, they've never had any other issues. It's not quite Yeti-level but it's as close as I've found and it is so much more affordable!! Definitely worth the purchase, especially if you haven't tried any of their other products yet.",positive

Its clean, easy to use, convenient and way less messy than the regular Wide Mouth Screw Top Lid can come in handy too. But the Straw Lid... sucked by not having any suction! lol.

The company does replacement lids in other colors, which is really cool. But I wish they sold more lids in this sage color. I love how the bottle and lid match. Gives a clean, modern look and feel.

192,Home & Kitchen,Fabric Shower Curtain Liner,$10.88 - $17.95,5,"This liner is a soft solid microfiber material that gives privacy but allows light through. I'm not using a second curtain so it lets a lot of light through right now. I would say this liner is waterproof because the water bounces off, doesn't go through it or get absorbed. It dries and looks like new once dried. It has magnets to help keep it from blowing on you but it does sometimes still slightly blow when the furnace kicks in but not very much compared to the lighter cheaper curtain liners. You can always buy more curtain magnets if it blows too much. I washed it first and it washed great. The grommets make it easy to hang and I'm using a double curtain hook and they fit perfectly.

200,Home & Kitchen,Linenspa 3 Inch Gel Infused Memory Foam Mattress Topper,$39.99 - $155.98,5,"I am going to address all of the negative comments by some other reviewers, because i experienced zero of their complaints.

There was absolutely no odor or fumes when we opened this, in the house, in winter, windows closed. Zero. I have asthma; I would have detected fumes when others do not. And I did so in the dining area of our small house with an L-shaped living room dining room, so it was pretty much 'in my face' for hours.

2/3 expanded in 3 hours. The rest of it was finished when we got up the next morning. Far less than even 12 hours.

It did not tear. It is bulky, (3 inch queen size) so I had help to move it to the bed, but its not really heavy that way. We did not drag it or pull on just one corner; we folded it in half and carried it to the bed. Then gave it a tug or two to align it. No indication it would tear.

Either I have a different product than the other reviewers, or some reviews are by competitors? Because all that was wonderful.

Comfort: Fantastic! I have recently hit the point of osteoarthritis in my hip, and am a side sleeper...and it felt like I was sleeping with a rock under me. Not sleeping well at all, needless to say. The 3 inch foam eliminated that issue for me as much as could be possible....95% of pain and discomfort gone, vanished!

Heat retention: I placed an old mattress cover around it, the kind that used to have some quilting but has been washed to the point it should have been trashed really...so just a touch of some insulation more than a sheet. The sheet I put on top was much heavier/thicker cotton sort of surface than any other sheets I have. The foam did retain some heat, but that was perfect for the arthritis in my hip, knees, feet. I will likely be putting away one of my two heavy blankets I have been using with a light quilted bedspread that is a good air block, and that's great. That former arrangement was too heavy and would get too hot and awaken me at night, but I needed that to get my joints warm and 'quiet' enough to sleep. Not anymore! The mattress topper gets very comfortably warm in just a few minutes. i am writing this in April in south central PA; temps have been in the upper 30s to upper 40s at night and our thermostat is set at 72 at night, though I have to close the vent in my small bedroom or i get roasted when the heat flows. The thermostat is that high because of the illness of my roommate and our 70 year old brick home is a bit drafty, needing windows and new insulation. I was quite comfortable having some gentle heat from retention by the foam on my joints, while my face and shoulders enjoyed the cooler room temp.

Its wonderfully soft and cushiony. I was comfortable both in my normal side sleeping positions, and also when I had my head rather elevated on multiple pillows (which puts more pressure on the hips). I did not experience any difficulty at all rolling over, even though I am 5'10"" and 195 lbs. I frequently roll over... so much so I use a queen bed all to myself. In fact, it was EASIER for me to roll over than it had been rolling over the hard mattress surface...my mattress is not a rock hard one, maybe the high end of medium firm. It has had about 6 years of regular use and has just recently developed just a touch of sag in the middle...just enough to increase pressure on my hip bone in certain positions....but this extra pressure disappeared with this wonderful topper.

I would anticipate that because this is foam, that at some point it will begin to stay compressed and eventually require replacing. That is affordable at this price.... I see the same complaints made by products costing even four times what I paid for this ($90 plus sales tax). if/when I experience this, i will come back and update my review for a time concept. If I don't experience this within 6 months, I might buy a second one for a backup. The pricing was great, and necessary, because I also need to replace my chair in the living room,which aggravates my arthritis, and I couldn't afford both a good new recliner and another mattress...which might not have been good enough without a topper anyway.

Extremely pleased at this moment!",positive
201,Home & Kitchen,Linenspa 3 Inch Gel Infused Memory Foam Mattress Topper,$39.99 - $155.98,5,"I have suffered with tremendous amounts of thoracic pain that also led to frontal rib pain. During the many doctors, chiropractor, and PT appointments to seek pain relief, it was never recommended to me to examine my sleeping habits or the type of bed/mattress I slept on. Out of desperation to reduce pain, I purchased a rather expensive, specialized mattress that allows for individual adjustment by increasing or decreasing air in a bladder. While this is a good mattress, it only helped moderately.
I took a chance and purchased this 3"" foam topper with the hopes of reducing my thoracic pain by 30 - 50 percent. Wow....was I surprised to receive an 80% reduction in pain by using this topper and it feels super comfortable on top of the particular mattress I am using. It can be a little warm to sleep on in the summer; but this hasn't been too much of an issue.

I have a a lot of back and hip problems due to arthritis and also shoulder issues. My husband has shoulder issues. The extra firm mattress helped his shoulder pain, but made my back and hip pain much worse. So, I first ordered a dark colored grey fabric topper (not memory foam), which was way too thin to help at all. Then, I ordered this one day later, after sleeping on the other one night. After receiving, I unfolded it and left it laying on top of my bed. It was compressed fully and very flat. It fully expanded within a couple of hours. I didn’t wait the recommended 24-48 hours to let it completely fill out since it already did so within a couple hours. I advise waiting longer if yours doesn’t look like it should and the recommended time hasn’t passed. I slept on it the same night, which was about 4-5 hours after sitting fully undisturbed. I kept the other topper over this one since it is so thin. This memory foam topper didn’t help over night. But, I did start seeing pain relief after sleeping on it for a week or two. I started seeing my pain lessen here and there over this period. My back still hurts sometimes, as arthritis issues will. But, this memory foam mattress did help a lot. So far, I’d buy it again. Keep in mind that I haven’t had it a long time. I could feel completely different in 3-6 months. It says I bought a 3 inch. But, I bought a 2 inch. I will update if anything changes.
Update 8/21/22- it's still working pretty well. My reviews still stands for now. I will mention that it sometimes will move an inch or two toward my husband's side of the bed. I'm a side sleeper and do have to switch positions many times while sleeping. So, it could be happening because of me. But, I'm not sure. It doesn't do this on my husband's side. It isn't hard to get the foam carefully pulled back to my side when needed. I have to be careful to not break my nails doing it though. Sometimes, I'll wake up and feel like I'm in a hard feeling flat spot, like it gets mashed with my body's imprint. I just move out of that spot for 5-10 seconds to let the memory foam fill back in. I think this sometimes bothers me more because of the amount of pain I typically have. I can go back to sleep pretty quickly after letting the foam fill in. My sleep quality is still pretty good.

204,Home & Kitchen,Linenspa 3 Inch Gel Infused Memory Foam Mattress Topper,$39.99 - $155.98,5,"Very pleased with the 2"" memory foam topper. I always find myself making excuses for the cheapest options on Amazon, before they even get here, too. You know the generic, everyday department store kind of items that don't need to be brand name. Whether it's something like a mattress topper, tools, electronics, etc. I always assume that the item is gonna have something thats a little off before it arrives. Thats possibly because I'll look for things like button-down shirts, or fitted sheets, and end up finding a perfectly fitting shirt, dare I say the best shirt I've ever lain across my back. The shirt that will change my life. However, in the recent years I must remind myself to adopt a policy of pre-dissapointment. Because usually, right after the nice little shirtprise occurs, I find that the fine garment I purchased, used, for 3 american dollars, has a third sleeve. Just for instance. I am not going to sit here and lie about it any longer.. dammit I loved that shirt, and when I think how shallow it was of me to reject a fine shirt like that, over something as trivial as an extra sleeve sewn into the back of the shoulder.. well I'll just say I'm not proud of it.. but my tale of epic shirtprise that ultimately ended in shirtzaster causes me to digress.. My original point was that if you're going to search through the bottom of the Amazon barrel, your gonna get a third sleeve every once in awhile. Well let me tell you, this 2"" topper was the cheapest option I found in the size I needed, and this intercourse rebound dampener is no three-sleever. The quality of my sleep before getting this topper was comparable to falling asleep in a bar stool. in a bar. I would wake up every 10 minutes, every morning i would need two advil and a midol just to get out of my medeviel torture rack of a bed. My neck, my back, my elbow and my sack would cause me quite a bit of bad pain. Not these days though. These days I fall asleep before my head even hits the pillow. I mean so fast I don't even have time to say goodnight to my wife or maintain a meaningful relationship with her and my 2.5 beautiful miracle children, and that's one of the few statements I've made here that you can take to the bank. To summarize, all I have to say... is that I'm not all that complicated, or all that rich. I'm not all that passionate about my marriage, and I'm definitely not gonna be gettin any of those mug's claiming I'm the world's greatest father, or world's greatest anything, and frankly just bringing up those facts used to cause me some mild, severe depression and life was just so bleak. But today I walk the streets with my head held high and just a little cocky, as If to say, ""hey girl, what your name is?"" To the world, and act unaffected when answered by the world with a firm ""get away from me."" Basically friends, fellow amazoner's, is that today I'm a changed man, and as far as the government and the paper boy are concerned the old me doesn't exist. It has done so much as transformed my meaningless existence into just a literal existence! Its turned my metaphorical toothless frown into a lipped horizontal line. Its as if myself and this single little 2"" memory foam mattress topper were lost in this big crazy world, doing big crazy things, with big crazy people, in big crazy places, wearing big crazy hats, but then the rain stopped, the clouds parted, the sun shone through and we started a wicked-awesome moshpit in the mud with each other, but we're also doin it at the first woodstock or like one of the first 4 lalapaloozas, and the 2"" memory foam mattress topper and I are just out there in the middle of the crowd.. gettin all graphic in nature. Just the two of us, just each other, and I think we were with an old ""my pillow"" i found in a stadium bathroom awhile back that has the word ""jabroni"" written on it with sharpie.. but hey man, that pillow was a serious horndoggin-party-brother and we are all gods children... in closing, the mattress topper was more okay than anticipated. my previous experience with ""brand-less"" items will now be quietly repressed until the next three-sleever item is delivered. 5 out of 5 would buy again.",positive
205,Home & Kitchen,Linenspa 3 Inch Gel Infused Memory Foam Mattress Topper,$39.99 - $155.98,5,"Been sleeping on this for a couple of weeks. Fantastic rest. Even enjoy being on my back.

Set up on the twin bed set up like a bench in the room the German Shepherd and his two little cats chill.

Everyone seems happy at the comfy new pad.

Médium firm. A little squishy. I’m about 145 pounds at 5’9”. Dog is 90 pounds. Cats are collectively about 12 pounds combined.

With the four of us cuddling this bed cushion holds up well. If one of us moves or leaves the rest of the bench doesn’t move the others around.

For the price this is an exceptional buy. I’m not certain why everyone isn’t happy.

If a firm mattress pad is needed Joanne Fabric has a three inch pad that I use for custom seven foot XL twin size benches in a community room I built.

I added a water proof cover with a zipper. Then encased in duvets. Added lots of pillows. Those are comfy and firm.

For me, in my mid fifties, have slept on different type beds. From feather in Austria to crappy cheap in a hotel.

I’d say this is one of my favorite.

I’ve see other people use this for repairing couch pillows. I’d say this would be a great option for customizing RV’s for a better alternative to stock options.

If it’s on a board rather than a mattress think it would be a little firmer. Mine is on a mattress as a topper.

Hope this is helpful. If so could ya give a like?

Thanks for reading.

/\ update
The speed at which this Linenspa pad inflates surprised me.

The full sized Serta bought at a store a few years ago required a few days based on instructions.

Measured all the way around edges. All 3 inches rather quickly. Less then ten minutes.

I’m giving this a test drive for a week or two before noting how I feel after sleeping. The floof so fast promoted an immediate introductory review.

The card included is very straight forward. If there’s an issue immediate contact info. Cute truth or dare questions. No spoilers from me.

“Pro Tip” note says in a cold room this could take 48 hours to decompress. Sounds like a few people I knew. If it were only this easy with humans 😝

I’ll check back in after I’ve had some sleeps. This is replacing a different pad that’s had a good life. So far this seems a major upgrade by appearances alone.

I recently bought two cots for our June camp trip and bought this topper to cushion it. I got the full size, cut it in half length wise and they fit perfectly. Holy crap is it comfortable! Everyone else was complaining about all the bumps and rocks but we were off the ground and slept GREAT with these foam toppers.
I realize I’m using it in a way that it’s not really made to be used but for our purposes I’m very pleased. It packs horribly of course cause it’s not meant to be rolled and crushed down before being stuffed into a rooftop cargo bag- but we had the extra space and a good nights rest outdoors is worth it.

I may end up buying some inflatable mats for the cots just for the sake of packing lighter but for now if it’s not being used for camping we put it on our bed so we are just more comfortable 😏",positive

But what I've noticed with this pad is that if I go to bed tired, I can sleep like a rock on this and wake far better rested than without it. Often, I wake without any sweats--just being real that no surface is going to be a perfect solution to night sweats if your hormones are in flux as often happens with menopause and after.
I bought this to replace an older egg-crate style 1 inch pad which I had for years. This memory foam has been just great! Downside is that I have taken it off my bed for sleeping away from home, and it's not really sturdy enough to be great for transporting. It works once I get it put in place--just not easy to roll up and travel with. Taking it on the road caused a few tears but still working fine. ...

Sleeping on it is great for me. I have several joints that hurt due to old injuries that typically wake me up throughout the night. Surprisingly I've slept through the night since getting this mattress topper. It conforms to by body but provides support it in all the right places to alleviate pain. I sleep a little warmer on this mattress topper than on my mattress alone, but I wouldn't say it's hot. I haven't woke up sweating or uncomfortable.

210,Home & Kitchen,"Katchy Indoor Insect Trap - Catcher & Killer for Mosquito, Gnat, Moth, Fruit Flies - Non-Zapper Traps for Buzz-Free Home - Catch Flying Insect Indoors with Suction, Bug Light & Sticky Glue (White)",$44.99,5,"I purchased a scratchNdent and found my item had been used and slightly damaged, the top swirl grill was missing a small piece, and one of the sticky disks had been put into the unit already with a gnat stuck to it. Okay. I plugged it in, pushed one of the setting buttons (standard) and the light came on and the little fan makes a little bit of breeze, but wet a finger and hold it at the bottom and it is breezing out.

It is also bigger than I expected, but I have such a tiny bug issue in this place, I don't care as long as it works. Something was mentioned about it works better in lower light levels. So. I plugged it in and set it up in a place I have been having issues. Four hours later, I pick it up to look down in. There's a lot more than one gnat on the mat already. It's doing the job. Great.

The local little winged wildlife has resisted: letting the pots dry out good between waterings, watering with a mix of hydrogen peroxide and water, top mulching the pots, and the yellow sticky trap things. This seems to be vacuuming them up. YAY! If this works out I will get a couple more as I have plants in a few areas in my house.

Trust me, I have at least six different microbugs including fruit flies, fungus gnats (arrgh!), a different gnat, and not sure exactly but a few are like tiny tiny various sorts of beetles... keeping the swarms down would be wonderful, without killing my plants. I will update this as it goes..

The picture isn't quite truelight because it is fairly dark in there, but. That's what it sorta looks like ON in the dark. To the right that is a matte BLACK surface that it's reflecting off of.

Edit: my house is large, my buggie collection is way down on one end of the house where I have my first one, but. I just got a second one, also scratchNdent, to deal with the other end.

I seen where someone complained that it is a fly-spa. This will NOT work on houseflies. They are too big and strong to be whooshed down onto the sticky pad. There are other ones built ($60-80) as wall sconces that WILL do the houseflies. This isn't built for that.

However all the assorted little gnats and such are collecting at alarming rates on my sticky pads. It is nice to sit at my computer in the evening and not kill at least a dozen tiny assorted buggies. And my fungus gnat problem that came in with some potting soil mix, is pretty much gone.

I can't say enough, if you have a grow booth and issues with little critters, that putting one of these in the booth at about two weeks for a night will not affect your grow and if there is anything in there it will clear out most of the problems. I have one room where the booth and most of my houseplants live (plus my spring starts as I go into that season as I update this) and the first one is outside the grow booth on the floor where it clears
that room pretty well.

Second one installed near the kitchen sink and other bathroom on other end of house, as there is a persistent problem there. I don't think it will catch sewer flies but those tend to respond to hot vinegar flushed through a running disposal with hot sink water, then follow with a cut up lemon and some icecubes run through the disposer. I will let you know if I get those little buggers back and if it can catch one or not.

On both I am turning them off during the day and on after dark, as that is when the UV light seems to be the most visible to the little winged pests. I also want to see if the kitchen one will draw spiders. There are a few kinds that are drawn to dead prey, and though I have sticky traps for them, if this will be able to stick one down or not if it comes to check it out. Another thing I will update.

Edit update. Plant area one is catching mostly gnats, vatloads of them. Kitchen has only a few, but is getting the fruit flies from the bananas. I put spider traps near both and the kitchen catch is up. Could not be happier with both Katchys. Have spring bedding and flower starts going and a new grow in the tent. I’ve put one in the tent a few times and no gnattie problem (last time will be day/ night 18 so as not to mess up auto blooming). No chemicals. Still worth the price. Replacing the sticky pads is super easy too.

Edit: very late fall. We are the house servants of two mixed breed part Persian purries. The grey and white one in particular has very fine hair and a very full coat despite daily brushing/grooming. So we have slightly pre-used fur all over. Plus lots of house dust-joys of where we live. I have to take a q-tip to the top of both my Katchy’s weekly to keep the house glorp from obstructing airflow (also have to do it to our tower fans). Still catching the tiniest no-see-ums, fungus gnats and fruit flies. With fall garden harvest, the fruit flies moved in. I added a capful of apple cider taped off with a few holes next to the kitchen one, and it was literally carpeted with fruit flies in the bottom. The plants that came in brought micro buggies, and those numbers are quickly dropping as well.

A Katchy doesn’t instantly get your population but in days you should have a disgusting collection on the bottom pad… I purchased a no- zap UV/sticky pad catcher meant for houseflies and installed over the toilet at the ceiling. It also does the job with a little time. So. Katchy do their job well, are easy to use and maintain, and paired with a true flycatcher, really helps keep you unbothered. $40 well spent.",positive

I set up Katchy last night in the bathroom that seems to be the source of these tiny moth-like pests that emerge from our drains each summer. By morning, it had caught 25-30. There were one or two drain flies on the window and shower curtain, but morning usually finds closer to a dozen clinging to the room's vertical surfaces.

We've tried everything we could think of to eliminate drain flies, including pouring gallons of bio-gel drain cleaner down our sinks to replacing our our 70-year-old home's main drain line out to the sewer. Every July or August, the drain flies return as our underground pipes get warm enough to drive them inside.

My hope, at this point, is that running Katchy around the clock will make a noticable dent in our drain fly population within a week.

• I witheld one star because I can't speak to Katchy's longevity. It could be dead in a week, but then so could any of us.

• I was also disappointed that Katchy came with only four glue board and that the company's replacements cost $1.75 a piece sold as an eight pack. Fortunately, compatible non-Katchy glue boards can be found on Amazon for 50 cents a piece. That's about the same unit price as the much stickier Pest Pro Mouse, Spider, Roach & Insect Glue Boards I use in the furnace room to trap insects. Using a pair of scissors, one could probably cut two Katchy-size glue boards out of every 8""x5"" Pet Pro glue board.",positive

I am SUPREMELY disappointed because I was so excited at the thought of having an effective method to combat my nemesis that is the mischievously thriving fruit fly colony which plagues me, and this item arrived this morning broken. :( The blades of the fan internally are not connected and are banging about inside. Though I don't normally pay full price for things unless necessary (I either wait for a good sale or use applicable coupons/promo codes), I took the plunge on this purchase due to my need for a competent and efficient resolve combined with it's GLOWING reviews! First, I had to wait 9 days to receive the item, which I wasn't happy about, but not upset either. I have literally been checking tracking daily and looking forward to it's arrival. Then it arrives *HAPPY DAY*. I opened the package, removed the unit (felt/heard something odd but didn't think too much of it at that moment), reviewed the directions, plugged it in and although the light came on, the fan did not. I thought maybe I need to press a particular button or what-have-you, so I re-read the directions. Nope, it should be automatic. So I then began inspecting the unit and realized the fan blades were not connected. I then even looked for a way to open the unit without busting it so that I can fix it myself (I'm incredibly handy and that's how much I wanted this to work!). No go. I could probably open it up, but then it wouldn't be returnable. Ok, so THEN I go to the item link on Amazon and as of earlier today, it said ""This item is currently unavailable"" followed by something to the effect of 'and we don't know if or when it will become available'. I attempted to contact the seller to no avail. My only viable option was and is to return it. I don't want to return it for a refund or leave a bad review. Rather, I want the working unit I paid and patiently waited for. Errrrr. I decided to go about my day knowing I'd come back to this later and here I am. ... I pull the item up this evening, it is in fact available again, but instead of the $39.79 price I paid 9 days ago, it is right now (6/15/2018) listed at $54.49. Whaaaa?? So I am leaving this review in hopes that the seller will contact me and make good on my purchase, at which point I would update my review to reflect the working conditions of this seemingly enigmatic device.

In summary, this 1 star review encompasses only that the item arrived broken and therefore did not operate as intended. A working unit may very well be worthy of all it's positive reviews. And maaaaybe even the new $54.49 price.

I hope I am a unique case. I also hope this review was of help to you.

Update 6/17/18:
The seller contacted me today apologizing for my inconvenience and explaining that Amazon is responsible for the damage done during the shipping of this product. I responded immediately that I appreciate the response and although I completely understand that Amazon assumes the shipping responsibility, I am also concerned that I cannot repurchase a working unit at the price I paid 2 weeks ago. I inquired how this can be rectified, stating that I fully intend to update my review according to their level of service and the actual benefits of a working unit.  And now I await their response.

Honestly, if I have to repurchase at the higher price, I won't and I'll leave my review star at 1. It's not the price as much as the principle. Products can be damaged in shipping, that's understandable. But the seller is also responsible for commitment. So I'm really hoping they come through with a reasonable resolve that honors the price I paid for a working unit. I'll keep you posted.

Update 7/1/18:
The seller not only replaced my originally bought unit, but included extras as well. They have been extremely diligent in correspondence and I can honestly say that I am not only satisfied, but impressed.

With that said, I would not have altered my review to 5 stars for customer service alone. ...these units works amazingly! The home I live in was built in 1924 and does not sport insulation the way a new home would. So pests are/can be/were a problem. The units do in fact attract flying things very well! The sticky pad of results had 2 bugs I didn't know I had and don't recognize. I am extremely happy with my purchase! And may very well buy more.

The unit itself is aesthetically pleasing and is relatively quiet. Night is the best time for results since that's when it's darkest and the bugs can 'see' the light. The blue light transitions in brightness, which is even more effective in attracting it's prey.

I'm changing my review from a 1 star to a 5 star. I saw other reviews stating it was a flimsy design. I do get what they're saying, but how thick must this unit be to rectify that?? It works as intended and looks good doing it. The bottom is easy to open to check and/or replace the sticky pad. There are only 2 buttons so it's super easy to operate. And it doesn't look like a bug catcher at all. No one would know. So I feel it's 'flimsiness' (is that a word?) is of no concern. As long as it performs, who cares how heavy or thick it is?

This is 5 stars from someone who had to work for it. I hope this review helped you! Happy bug hunting :)",positive

It did catch normal house flies, though they were not as drawn to the light or noise like gnats/fruit flies or mosquitoes. My only frustration was the amount of dust that built up in the top fan part and there was no way to open it to clean it out so it was just accumulating and I did notice it wasn't working as well. I tried the vaccum hose and nothing seemed to work and I was getting really frustrated but then I decided to use a spray can duster (like for a computer keyboard) and it worked like a charm.

Because it uses a light to attract the bugs it works best in the dark. It catches a good deal of nats. Even though it says it does not catch flies, mine caught quite a few of them. There were a couple of times when a fly flew out when I opened the bottom. I guess a strong fly gets away from the sticky pad. It might be that the flies get pushed in and trapped by the wind from the fan. After a while it gets tired and sticks to the pad on the bottom. Just guessing. Also caught a little moth like bug.

It does what it’s supposed to do and it looks great doing it!! It’s super easy to use. None of the other bug-removal attempts I’ve tried have worked (though I haven’t been very proactive about anything else, which is why I’m enjoying this thing since I barely have to do anything!)

I finally decided I needed to do something this summer. I’ve been living in the same place for 5 years and bugs have never been a huge problem, but for some reason the mosquitos are way worse this year. I think it’s probably because I over-watered my lawn, so they’re out in droves. Also my indoor plants have very recently gotten infected with these horrible little gnats (they look a lot like fruit flies, but they live in soil). This machine has significantly reduced both the gnats + mosquitos that have been inside in the last couple weeks since I started using it.

The bugs aren’t sticking to the paper very well anymore, one just flew off of it when I went to take this photo, so it’s probably time to change that (there is a pack of the sticky papers included with your purchase). It could not possibly be easier to switch them out for a new one, the designers of this definitely thought of how to make it as hassle-free as possible. Also great that it’s easy to access because I love opening this thing periodically to see how many more bugs we’ve gotten in there.

Just buy it. If you’re at the point where your bug problem is bad enough that you’re wondering if it’s worth shelling out for one of these, then you should go for it. I really don’t think you’ll regret it.

Some other reviews mentioned that you could make your own sticky paper instead of buying more from this company. I think that’s a great idea for anyone whose handy. As someone who is way too lazy with this kind of stuff to ever make my own, I’m happy to keep buying the sticky pads from this company until the end of time.

Hope that helps and good luck with your bugs!",positive

The zapping model apparently killed nothing. The bottom tray remained empty, even when I positioned it right near the window where the bugs were sneaking in. I would have left a bad review, but that model is no longer for sale on Amazon - I wonder why...

The Katchy has done well and continues to run 24/7. I finally changed the sticky board after a month and numerous problems ""removed"". I noticed a different within the first 24 hours of plugging it in, and it continues to deliver. I wish it was a bit quieter, but it does a great job and I have been running it on the slower fan speed the entire time of this test. I even swapped tested the location of this one and the other zapper mentioned above, and this one was the only one that continued to kill bugs including all kinds of bugs. Great product.

I can't speak for those people but for myself this thing absolutely catches bugs. The one big downside is that this thing is hard to clean.

So you probably have to replace the machine (not the traps, the MACHINE) once a year. You can prolong the life of the machine by making sure it isn't placed near dusty areas. And that you turn it off during the day when you're not using it. I'd also try vacuuming the top of the machine once in a while to get it ""unclogged.""

I'm not sure how well this would work in a bigger apartment or a house (you might need multiple depending on how many areas you have flies in) but for my 1BR apartment it's worked great. One word of caution - maybe it's just me and my morbid curiosity, but I wouldn't recommend opening the trap often to see how many flies have been caught. The fly trap part has a grating so you can see the flies, but it's dark and you don't get a full view of the trap. I opened the trap compartment and a fly was able to get out.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I very much like the slim, stainless steel, sleek profile of the scale, I like the width of it for placing a bowl on it, and I really like how the buttons seem simple and easy to operate.

I bought from this company because the customer service seemed good in the reviews.

Unfortunately, the digital kitchen scale unit was never accurate from the day I bought it. I always treated it gently, as I do all my things, kept it in his original plastic sleeve and cardboard box when I stored it in my kitchen cabinet in between attempts to use it. It certainly never was jarred or fell so that can’t be the argument for Wyatts in accurate.

I wasn’t sure how to prove to myself whether or not it was accurate, but it seemed INaccurate from the very beginning.

It took me over a year to figure out how to — duh! — take it to thr grocery store where I purchase bulk spices. As they weighed each bulk bag on their accurate check out scale, I re-weighed it on my Etekcity digital scale model EK6015, and indeed, the scale was wildly off.

I tried calling the phone number inside the product box, but they don’t accept messages.(Argh!!! I hate it when customer service does that, by the way!!!) Their outgoing message said to use email and expect a reply in two days.

I will update this review when I have their reply and find out how they handle the customer service.

As long as the customer service continues to be good, I look forward to trying another version of the scale, and expect it to be accurate. If not, I will be very unhappy and will let my recommendation of one star stand.",positive

The shaker ball does a fine job of blending powders into liquid bases but occasionally small berries and chopped fruit and other ingredients can get stuck in the ball though this is not a serious concern if you chop to size or keep small fruits like strawberries whole and avoid the minor inconvenience.

I took one star off for having to wash the container quickly after use to avoid picking up “off” odors. I have had to wash it several times in a row to rid it of strange smells when I’ve kept it in the fridge overnight or taken a shake on the road where immediate washing isn’t possible. Just wash in warm soapy water right away and you’ll be good. It is dishwasher safe, top shelf, but I don’t like food grade plastics in the dishwasher’s heat and chemicals cleaners so I hand wash my shaker.

I recommend this product for its value price but remember to clean it fastidiously. 😁",positive
231,Home & Kitchen,"BlenderBottle Classic V2 Shaker Bottle Perfect for Protein Shakes and Pre Workout, 20-Ounce, Cyan",$8.79 - $27.46,4,"I wanted a giant sealed water bottle that i can leave in the fridge for cold water and originally went with the giant nalgene. I returned the nalgene because it was delivered cracked on both sides. The side walls were very thin. This giant blender bottle seems sturdier and more durable. I use it as a giant water bottle/pitcher that i leave in the fridge for cold water. It serves its purpose well enough. It is durable and sealed. The spout is big enough that I don't have to take off the lid to refill from my water dispenser. It is easy to clean like any blender bottle. It is tall, but it sits well and balanced. It is perfect for my use case.

My only issue is the lid. It does take some force to open and close the spout. It doesn't open and close as easily as its smaller counterparts. I find that I have to really apply some force to pop it open and snap it shut.",positive
232,Home & Kitchen,"BlenderBottle Classic V2 Shaker Bottle Perfect for Protein Shakes and Pre Workout, 20-Ounce, Cyan",$8.79 - $27.46,5,"Has not leaked a single drop in 40+ uses. Drinking lid is a bit hard to snap, but I like that. It won't come open unless you are foolish enough to try using carbonated drinks in it. It is CLEARLY not meant for pressure. Also, if you are a macho man who likes to force everything, the lid seal might leak after awhile. I turn slightly past initial resistance and have no issues.

Really like the unit. Throw in the whisk, mix, and 3-4 ice cubes, shake 50-60 times, and you get a perfect ice cold mix every time.

Only downside is that bottle starts to smell bad from the protein if you do not wash every time, which is to be expected. Wash and it goes away. Bought two more so I could throw in dishwasher top rack. Whisk does not accumulate any protein, which I was concerned about with the ""paddle"" type mixers.

It is a simple unit but absolutely effective.",positive

I had bright red fruit punch colored liquid spray all over the kitchen more than once, despite doing my best to make sure it was tightly sealed.

The stainless steel whisk ball is amazing, springy, and easy to clean. The smaller sized cups i got are PLENTY big enough for me, I'm not chugging gallon sized smoothies..lol. I just add like 8 or 10 oz liquid and 1 large scoop protein powder, shake for about 10 seconds and it's done! Easy to drink from without dripping. Every detail of these bottles is well thought out.

260,Home & Kitchen,Bentgo Kids - Leakproof Children’s Lunch Box,$26.90 - $36.98,5,"If you're on the fence about which bento box to order for your child (BENTGO KIDS or YUMBOX), I will compare the two brands in this review. My family has used both kinds for about a month.

**BENTGO KIDS**

My 5 year-old kindergartner takes this box for his lunch, and it is truly the better choice for YOUNGER CHILDREN in my opinion. It has a more juvenile color scheme, five small food compartments, DURABLE RUBBER TRIM on the top and bottom, and overall exudes a higher quality product that will withstand more abuse than the Yumbox. The latches are more HEAVY-DUTY than the Yumbox, and although it can be a bit difficult for kids to close at first (it's a tight seal around the inner tray), my son got the hang of it after a couple tries. The Bentgo Kids trays come in three different colors and seem more durable than the Yumbox trays.

The Bentgo Kids box doesn't hold a LOT of food, but it is plenty for my son, and I imagine it will provide ample food until he's in second or third grade (probably a good box for 3-8 year-olds?). The largest compartment will fit a half sandwich unless your bread is huge, but then you can just cut it in quarters. The Bentgo Kids shell is a bit larger than the Yumbox, so it's a tight squeeze into my son's soft-sided LL Bean box, but we manage to fit the Bentgo and a Lifefactory water bottle into the LL Bean box.

*UPDATE* - We recently purchased an LL Bean Discovery lunch box, and this easily fits either the Bentgo or Yumbox as well as a water bottle and extras. The Bentgo also fits in a Lands' End ClassMate soft sided lunch box with a Goodbyn water bottle (see photo).

Does the Bentgo Kids leak? Nope. The rubber gasket on the lid is impressive, and ranch dressing has stayed neatly in the center dip compartment. The gasket on the Yumbox doesn't seem to be as good, so this is another reason why I like the Bentgo Kids better for younger children. It's pretty much foolproof. To clean, simply remove the inner tray and put it in the dishwasher. I always hand wash the outer shell or at least give it a wipe-down each day.

**YUMBOX PANINO**

I purchased this Yumbox Panino for my 9 year-old third grader. I like the Yumbox Panino colors and design better for OLDER CHILDREN (maybe 7-12 year-olds?). It's less juvenile than the Bentgo Kids box, and the Panino version has room for a larger sandwich. Since its tray has thin dividers, it will HOLD A BIT MORE FOOD too. The Yumbox has a slightly SMALLER FOOTPRINT than the Bentgo Kids, and it fits snugly in my son's LL Bean lunch box, but his water bottle does make his lunch box lid bulge out - not a big deal. We have since upgraded to the LL Bean Discovery lunch box, which is much deeper and has plenty of room. If you only have room for a small, narrow water bottle, the Goodbyn bottle is a great option (found on Amazon).

We have packed ranch dressing in the center, and as long as I press down tightly while latching the lid, it doesn't leak. The inner tray has printed text underneath (they are not removable stickers), but it does have a more grown-up look to it than the whimsical designs on other Yumbox trays. Yumbox sells plain trays on their website. The tray easily snaps out for washing in the dishwasher, but we always wash the outer shell by hand.

FOUR compartments or SIX? Yes, Yumbox offers two different versions - same size, but the trays have either more or less compartments. I debated greatly over which to buy, but ultimately I decided that the Panino (4 compartment) style would grown with my son better than the 6-compartment Yumbox, and on days when he doesn't pack a large sandwich, I simply use silicone baking cups as dividers. Links to the cupcake liners and leaf-shaped food picks shown in my photo are at the end of this review.

SUMMARY:

Both boxes have different features, so the box to choose really depends on your child's needs. The YUMBOX PANINO is my favorite for OLDER CHILREN or those who eat larger lunches because of the tray design and color combinations. The BENTGO KIDS is terrific for younger kids as it seems MORE DURABLE yet holds plenty of food for little ones. I do wish the Bentgo Kids box came in more colors, but perhaps this is in the works. For now, my son enjoys using his different-colored trays to switch things up a bit.

Due to this, we looked into electric coolers and portable refrigerators, and found we wanted a refrigerator. This is because it cools to the point of refrigeration but does not run constantly.

This Bodega fridge cools very quickly, holds up to larger size bottles (think 2 liters or wine bottles) and has a large capacity. For the price point it was a great deal as it has both the cigarette lighter adapter as well as the 12 volt. We take it in the truck with us when not camping. We've been using it nonstop for a month with no problems

Highly recommend and would purchase again.",positive

The word goes out on their little mosquito teletype devices - or snapchat - whatever the case may be - that the sweet blood humans are out and about and ripe for the biting. I use bug spray liberally when going out for walks, but then I have to shower to avoid transferring the spray onto my clothes and sheets when I retire for the evening. I don't want to have to do that when I am simply sitting on my back deck, sipping a frosty beverage and enjoying the long languid summer evenings in the shade of my heavily treed yard.

I have invested in several Thermacell Mosquito Repellent devices and need to order refills every 6 weeks or so. This particular bundle provides a great combination of fuel cylinders and repellant mats. The cylinders last for 12 hours and the mats conveniently change color as they are used, so you know exactly when to change them out. I like the dirt scent which seems to be largely targeted to hunters,, but to me it smells like the earth rather than dirt - although one could argue that they are one and the same. Regardless, it is not an artificial flowery scent - it is the good earth. And I like that.",positive

I do allot of summer outdoor work and in the past, was infected twice by West Nile. This is when I realized that spraying yourself from head to toe doesn't suffice in repelling the dangerous disease. The fog from the Thermacell Repeller is quite exceptional, and only when I mistakingly venture too far from the source of the Repeller, do I find myself amongst the pesky and dangerous insects again.

290,Home & Kitchen,Honeywell,$16.99 - $52.66,5,"I bought this little fan for use at my desk in a hot bedroom that cannot have a window air conditioner because we bought side opening windows not realizing their limitation that way-never thinking I would fall in love with it. The first day I used it we had the unending heat wave in NY and I thought it would be an added boost to the other 2 floor fans I was using to alternate using the air conditioner after we had a 3 hour power outage. Was I ever delighted and surprised. I put it on a side sofa table in the living room instead of the super hot bedroom and the dog immediately laid down in front of it and went to sleep. When I turned the air conditioner on later, I kept asking my husband what temperature we had it on because the air conditioner felt like it had become so much more powerful and we realized we had forgotten to shut off this small fan but it was maximizing the air conditioner big time. Right now the dog has put herself right in front of it and is snoring away. I am so tempted to return the big floor fan I bought at the same time ( never realized there was assembly for that one) and just buy another one of these.
It also has a nice footprint ( I bought the white one based on other reviews)- it looks nice, is quiet, petite and attractive. All in all, a winner.",positive
291,Home & Kitchen,Honeywell,$16.99 - $52.66,5,"tl;dr - This thing is quieter and MUCH stronger than my pedestal fan!

-------------------
Wanted to buy a fan for my mother's bedroom. We had two fans in the house before this buying this one. One is in my room, which is a pedestal-style Black + Decker fan, and the other is a fan from Vornado that has the same shape as this fan, albeit larger and more heavy-duty looking. Pedestal fan sucks. As in, it's so bad, you can't feel the air any further than 2 feet away from it. The Vornado fan on the other hand is a monster, you can feel it from across the living room.

So when we were looking for a new fan for my mother's bedroom, we looked for one that had the same shape as the Vornado fan, but a little more compact and not as overpowering. Which brings us to this Honeywell fan. It's cheap, we're not expecting much from it, but whatever, it's summer. Fan arrives, and... man, we're blown away! (badum tss)

I'm not sure if it's the design or what, but this fan blows stronger than my pedestal fan. I ended up feeling almost COLD after laying in front of it after a while. Needless to say, I ended up buying a second one for myself. Did I mention it's quieter than my pedestal fan?

I'll update this review if it ends up dying on me, but for now, this is a solid 5-star fan in my books.",positive
292,Home & Kitchen,Honeywell,$16.99 - $52.66,4,"It's a smaller version of a different Honeywell I have some experience with. It works just the same, with only a single grievance. When it's titled to the bottom level, it occasionally shifts itself to the second-to-the-last-level.

Considering it's price, it's amazing. It has more strength than a neighboring Lasko circular fan that's slightly larger. Up close, anyways. I'm not actually sure the overall difference, but that means nothing, even if they'd end up similar or some other garbage, the fan's cheap and it works great. The tilting makes it a winner above most other fans. You can aim it wherever you need to aim it! If you can't beat Air Man, then perhaps you can join him.",positive
293,Home & Kitchen,Honeywell,$16.99 - $52.66,5,"I bought one locally and was very impressed with it, so I bought two more from Amazon. They work at a distance that you wouldn't imagine such a small fan to work at, and they really push the air. Turbo Force is a good name for them. If I try to use it close by, it has to be on low, and even then it's too strong. The only thing I don't like about it is that, while it can tilt up in two positions, it can't tilt down.",positive
294,Home & Kitchen,Honeywell,$16.99 - $52.66,4,"I had bought another make of tabletop fan about 20 years ago and used it until it stopped. I like a fan in my room, in addition to my overhead fan, as a white noise machine and to provide some extra breeze as I sleep.

This little fan is great and was exactly what I wanted. But starting perhaps 8 weeks ago, I would turn it on as always, and it act like it was deciding whether it wanted to run that night or not. After a couple of minutes, the blades would very slowly begin to turn, and once it got up to speed, it was fine until I turned it off the next morning.

Not being the mechanical type, I was afraid it might be about to short out and possibly start a fire, so I bought a replacement, which arrived today.

As I glanced at the product instruction leaflet that came with it, I noticed that it is supposed to be possible to remove the front plate to clean the fan's interior. The instructions say to unscrew the screws. I can't find any screws, so I'm no wiser than before.

I also noticed that quite a lot of dust had accumulated in the interior of the first fan, and perhaps that was really the problem.

In any case, this is a fine little piece of equipment that answers its purpose exactly. I highly recommend it.",positive

296,Home & Kitchen,Honeywell,$16.99 - $52.66,5,"I live in an apartment without a patio door. The air from the windows is very limited. I now have a fan in the living room and one in the bedroom. I usually leave it on the low setting, it is quiet and works great bringing in air from the outside. I highly recommend these fans.",positive
297,Home & Kitchen,Honeywell,$16.99 - $52.66,4,"I have had a Honeywell HT-800 for over 12 years. I think I paid just under $10 for it back in 2007. It has been an amazing little fan that has never failed me. I use the fan on the floor facing straight up to circulate the air throughout the room. And it does the job perfectly. In the winter, once I turn on the fan (Slow speed), I notice a major warming in the room, especially on the floor in about 30 minutes. And the same result with air conditioned air in the summer.

I also love the slow speed for the perfect white noise at night for deeper better sleeping. And it has always worked very well for that purpose. So you can say it serves two functions overnight. It circulates warm air in winter and cool air in summer, and it helps me get a better sleep. Also on nice low humidity days, I would sit the fan on a window sill and draw in a little fresh cool air. Again on slow speed I felt a great breeze from 15 feet away.

Recently after 12 years, the fan started slowing down and sometimes stopping. I took it apart and cleaned and oiled the fan blade axle, and it started working great again and is still going like new. But this recent issue made me decide to buy a replacement, just in case. Of course after the great service of this fan over 12 years, I certainly wanted to get an exact replacement. Unfortunately, I noticed that the Model HT-800 was no longer available, but there is now an HT-900 that looks exactly the same. So I ordered one.

The new HT-900 is identical to my old HT-800 in almost every detail. The stand is shaped slightly different but that is not important. And considering that there is no mention anywhere of the fan blade size, it is 7 inches. Otherwise the design of the fan is the same as the old version.

The somewhat sad part is that this new HT-900 does not have the higher speed of its older version. The 800 and 900 both have three speeds, but they are very different. I have to run the 900 on hi speed to get similar airflow and sound as the old 800 has on medium speed. My best guess is..... The new 900 is about 35 to 50% slower on all 3 speeds compared to my old 800

The hi speed on the 900 is slightly slower than the hi speed on the old 800. Perhaps 20 to 25% slower. But the difference is easily noticed by both sound of fan speed and by the feel of air-flow.

There is one very good reason why the difference in speeds is so important. My old 800 has run on slow speed 99% of the time. Mainly because the slow speed was more than enough speed to serve its purpose. This is a good thing because it means that the fan has never been pushed to its maximum power. That means the fan motor ran cooler and did not have to work as hard. This contributed greatly to its very long lifespan.

It is the same principal as how a light bulb on a dimmer will last much longer than the same bulb at full brightness. A 200 watt light bulb dimmed down to 100 watts only runs at half power but still gives a 100 watt light. This extends the bulbs life because the bulbs filament runs cooler than it is rated for.

So far the new HT-900 works fine. For the same effect as my old 800, I just turn the speed of the 900 up to medium or hi. I just fear that this will shorten the lifespan of the fan by a lot. You never know, but I doubt this new 900 will last over 12 years like the old 800 has.

One other note of interest. For those who are bothered by the loudness of noise from a fan, YES the new HT-900 is much quieter on the slow and medium speeds. But they sacrificed higher airflow and perhaps years of life, for a slower quieter fan.

But on a good note, I set the new fan on the floor (Slow speed) aimed straight up to circulate the warm air at the ceiling. It took about twice as long but it finally warmed up the floor and whole room. And it did this quieter so I didn't have to turn up the TV as much. The manufacturer could have simply added a fourth slower speed for quieter running. I recommend this fan, but keep in mind that it may not last as long as the older models did.",positive
298,Home & Kitchen,Honeywell,$16.99 - $52.66,5,I bought one of these fans for my house and liked it so much I bought two more. I keep one running on low in the living room and one in the bedroom when I'm getting ready for work. It circulates the air well and has a calming sound. I gave one to my son for college.,positive
299,Home & Kitchen,Honeywell,$16.99 - $52.66,5,We purchased this fan to attach in the top corner of a doorway to move heat from one room to another. It's small enough for people to move freely between rooms and we were quite surprised that it moved so much air for its small size. It's run for one season and is ready for the next. We would definitely recommend this small fan to anyone who wants to get the air moving!,positive
