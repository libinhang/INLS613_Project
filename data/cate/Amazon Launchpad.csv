Ingredients are high-quality, I like that there's natural vitamin E (d-alpha and not dl-alpha) and that instead of folic acid, these vitamins have the superior form, methylfolate. At the recommended four-per-day rate, though, 3 people use up a 120-count bottle every 10 days. In other words, they're fairly expensive. They're also fairly low in Vitamin A and don't contain iron, which is good in the sense that kids aren't likely to be poisoned by eating too many, but we'd like to have a bit more of those nutrients in our vitamins. One child was also disappointed to learn that he won't be able to eat them after he has braces put on, because chewy things can pop the brackets off. The upside is that I don't have to remember to give them out every day because the kids remember on their own.",positive

Our 7 year old son tested off the charts for impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity in his ADHD evaluation and was diagnosed with severe ADHD in February of this year. He had struggled in school since kindergarten and received bad reports almost every single day from his teacher this year. He was frustrated because he couldn't control it, and we were distraught and all we wanted to was to do what was best for him. We wanted to help him so badly. I scrambled to find a doctor to set up and appointment with to discuss medication even though I am typically adverse to any medications for our family unless absolutely necessary and always seek natural methods first if possible. We were only a couple of weeks away from putting our son on ADHD pharmaceuticals. In a last ditch effort, I ordered Smarty Pants gummies and prayed with all my heart they would help. We also eliminated ALL artificial food dyes and began to eat as organic and clean as possible. After one week, we already noticed a difference. After 2 weeks, the difference was substantial. We went to his doctor appointment and she noticed such a difference that she was fully supportive of continuing our natural methods and even wrote a letter to support our decision to his school. The good reports started to come back from school and we are now almost 3 months in and we have only received a couple of semi-tough day reports. Overall his teacher has given us positive reports for weeks now and that has NEVER happened. His teacher even told us she no longer felt it necessary to have a support team meeting that they had arranged with several of his teachers and staff to strategize what to do next to help him because he has made so much improvement!!!! He still forgets from time to time and still needs redirection at times, but he was so bad before that he could barely even function and has now gone to fully succeeding and thriving! He is a completely different kid and we are eternally grateful for finding something that has completely changed our son's life and given him the ability to be the incredible kid he has always been. I tell everyone about these and joke that I would literally be their ""spokes-mom"" if I could because I love them so much.",positive

They were immediately brought inside and not left out in the heat. They look weird with goldish-type veins all over them but smell fine. I did see there were several other reviews with similar concerns. I was able to text message the actual Smarty Pants support to ask questions about why the sleep kids gummies look like this and if they were safe for consumption. This is the response I received from the company:

""Part of the production process includes drying the final gummies - and during the drying time the surface appearance of some gummies can be impacted more than others. This variance can occur in the same batch and also from batch to batch. There is no quality concern or safety risk from this appearance. We use a combination of herbal ingredients, including Saffron Extract, in SmartyPants Healthy Kids Sleep. Due to the nature of the saffron extract, there may be some natural color variance in the gummies. However, you can rest assured that this doesn't impact the purity, potency, and safety of the product, which are all tested for at a third-party lab. We are sorry for the concerns this has raised.""

I only gave this a three-star rating right now, because we only used them for one day. But I look forward to updating it after using it for a few weeks.",fair

We trust this brand with multivitamins too. Started to know more about this brand because Costco carries is, and Costco usually carries reputable brands, imho. So we thought maybe we could trust them w probiotic supplements as well.

Because my son doesn't drink milk, our pediatrician makes sure that we have cheese and yogurt, and we add this to make sure that my son's gut is as healthy as possible. After all, immunity stems from the gut. Since we started this (along w multivitamins, and vitamin c from this same brand), my unmasked son hasn't come home sick with anything from preschool, which is an amazing feat. Fingers crossed he continues to fight off anything that comes his way. We of course use these as SUPPLEMENTS to a healthy diet. I sent him in w a full tummy of fruit, yogurt, and an egg on rice every morning.

Good luck with your decision, and I hope this helped a bit. :)",positive

After becoming a big sister, the jealous behavior coupled with long standing bad sleep habits had her awake hours past her bedtime and multiple times a night.

She has been taking Smarty pants kids sleep for 7 nights, and fallen asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow for the past 4. These vitamins are life changing for her (/me)!

I give her a vitamin at the beginning of her routine and 20-30 minutes later she's asleep. I love that there's no melatonin. We plan to use these for 3ish weeks and then wean off for the rest of the bottle. I'm so grateful to have these! Hoping we finally get some good sleep habits!",positive

10,Amazon Launchpad,"Dude Wipes Flushable Wipes Dispenser,",$8.24 - $19.15,5,"My husband watched a Reel on Facebook about a guy who dissed the wipes publicly without trying them and he said that the company sent him for free to try and that he changed his stance on the product and explained that it was a game changer... husband just had to check them out so he ordered them and absolutely loves them. I guess men want and need a fresh and slightly tingly clean for the behind just as women do.

I tried one as well but didn't feel any minty or tingly sensation for the behind but definitely felt cleaner and if you have a burning sensation before using it like having stomach problems it does help sooth that as well.",positive
11,Amazon Launchpad,"Dude Wipes Flushable Wipes Dispenser,",$8.24 - $19.15,5,"Let's face it, these are kind of a touchy, uncomfortable subject for some, but once you take the first step by trying wipes instead of just dry toilet paper, you're going to want to find the best for the money. These are a good size, larger than others I've tried, and substantial enough not to worry about them failing you. They flush easily, perhaps my favorite feature: they dispense well. A lot of these wipes are hard to get out of the packaging, or give you several wipes when you want just one.",positive
12,Amazon Launchpad,"Dude Wipes Flushable Wipes Dispenser,",$8.24 - $19.15,3,"It’s my fault that I hadn’t noticed that dudewipes started making a flushable wipe. I don’t find flushable wipes worthwhile, they are far more expensive than my own recipe using a sawn-in-half roll of brawny paper towels with the core removed. I was looking for wipes for the family to control body odor from health problems.

That being said, these were a bit bigger than the other flushable wipes we’ve tried, but they are nearly impossible to even carefully remove from the package without them tearing apart into 4 or more tiny scraps. There’s better success if we remove a 1/2” tall stack all at once, pull off what’s needed, and ball up the rest so they don’t all break apart into a million pieces being pushed back through the fairly generously wide opening.

There’s a ton more plastic on each package than with cottonelle wipes also, and the hard non recyclable plastic top on these is probably a huge part of the problem.

No matter what, there’s simply no affordable way to make septic safe flushable wipes that will come anywhere near to the strength and softness of septic safe TP. I say softness, because pilled up balls of wipe don’t feel good on sensitive bits.

Unfortunately, I bought us a multi pack. I’ll see if someone else wants to see if they can make these work, because I absolutely detest burning $10 on a small addition to our compost pile and the guilt over throwing quite so much nonbiodegradable plastic in the trash and not even being able to use the product in the first place.

I was hoping to see if regular dudewipes might be able to occasionally substitute for body bed bathing cloths. I’m irked enough by the poor product design and crummy function for a higher price… definitely higher than a major brand that takes up easily 75% less space in a landfill, works easily 10-20 times better as far as doing what they’re supposed to, and in general, it doesn’t tick me off about making such a huge mistake.",fair

15,Amazon Launchpad,"Dude Wipes Flushable Wipes Dispenser,",$8.24 - $19.15,5,"Pros:
During a field exercise with the military, I packed these for a field-bath because there was going to be no showers available. First of all, no male (especially military guys) wants to be seen taking baby wipes with them. Dude Wipes bring that manly aspect to the baby wipe arena - thank you for that! Secondly, while I did use quite a bit, they worked perfect for a full body field bath. I used 2 packs over 7 nights (each night I bathed). Thirdly, these things do not leave any residue or sticky feeling of any kind. They make you feel like you just took a shower without actually having took one.

Cons:
Durability...unfortunately, there were multiple times that the wipes would rip or break apart if I began to ""scrub"" for just one swipe. They are thin and meant to simply wipe gently, not use pressure or scrub by any means.

I HIGHLY recommend and would encourage these to any guy that uses baby wipes...be a man - get some Dude Wipes!",positive

He can’t shower 5 times a day so in between activities he uses Dude Wipes and let me tell you it makes me want to cuddle and kiss him all the time (I refrain since he is older now and doesn’t want mommy cuddling him all the time). Now he takes Dude Wipes with him whenever he goes to long sporting events, Scout camping trips, and vacations. They’re easy to use and smell fresh and clean. I highly recommend!!

I bought them to improve my gut health after learning that some of my medication can harm the natural gut microbiome. I hoped it would help regulate my IBS-C & was surprised to see such a change in a short period of time! It took about 7-10 days for my stomach to adjust (not necessarily an upset stomach, just a lot of gas those first days!). I noticed that most people who were drinking these used a milk frother to blend them. I figured they were being extra and thought I’d just use my Blender Bottle. I was wrong! A Blender Bottle barely blends these and some type of frother/stirrer(?) is definitely needed. Even with the frother they don’t fully dissolve. I always blend up a scoop of the powder with about 8 oz of water and chug it then put another 8 oz in the glass to get the left over bits on the sides and bottom of the glass. It doesn’t taste bad but I’m not crazy about the texture or smell so I prefer to drink it quickly. Based on other reviews, I’m not sure if certain flavors have blending/dissolving issues or if it’s all of them. I’ve only tried Citrus so far and look forward to trying the other flavors.",positive

I do buy greens regularly, usually the generic Amazon brand, I do not enjoy it and I kind of just chug it to get it over with regardless of whatever flavor I get. Compared to the greens that I have tried this blows them out of the water. I ended up getting a deal on Amazon prime day which is why I tried the product in the first place and figured why not, it was around the same price of my other greens and I was due for a new bottle anyways. I am so glad I did. The flavor is amazing, it’s not overpoweringly sweet, I actually enjoy drinking it, it mixes well, it’s not gritty, and I don’t have to force myself to get my greens in.

I’m on my third bottle and it has definitely become part of my daily routine. I’ve tried the mixed berry and coconut flavors. I prefer the coconut because I found it to blend smoother. I just use a shaker bottle so maybe with an electric mixer it would be better. I drink it in the afternoon and it gives me a slight energy boost. Also if my stomach is ever upset it always helps with that too. Overall I’ve found that Bloom Nutrition delivers what they advertise.

It’s delicious! The instructions say to mix in 8 oz of water or juice but we wanted to try the flavor instead of disguise it in juice, and what a delicious surprise. Now, it was a little too sweet for our taste so we added more water and some ice and it helped with the sweetness but the flavor is there. Tastes like berries. It is very soluble but like any other powder, eventually settles and you can expect that in most powder drinks that contain vegetables but in this case you mix it again and it almost disappeared, I don’t mind it but a lot of people do. I’m glad we finally found a healthy green powder with a fantastic flavor so you don’t taste the greens only the fruit and that you don’t have to drink it with juice.",positive

The scent is very mild and not unpleasant as well. I like it, but only 1 of my 3 children is willing to drink it and 1 tasted it without seeing it, so he wasn't influenced by the color. I understand it's not marketed for kids so I won't hold that against it. It blends very easily but there's a little sludge at the bottom of the cup I need to mix some additional water to in order to get the full serving.

30,Amazon Launchpad,"Hint Water Bottles, Zero Sugar, Zero Calories, Zero Sweeteners, Zero Preservatives, Zero Artificial Flavors",$10.28 - $50.08,5,"So I’m a fan of Hint water. The flavors are pretty accurate. The Cherry is my favorite, but lately it’s been a lot less flavorful than it used to be, and especially in comparison to the other flavors. For example the Crisp Apple (green) tastes exactly like a crisp green apple and you can’t miss it. With the Cherry, sometimes it’s hard to even taste it.

I wish there was more of a variety on Amazon in the 12 packs. I assume they don’t have all the flavors on Amazon to push you to their website.

The cost:
Most of the time, for a 12 pack of the Cherry flavor, it’s around $13 which I find reasonable. On their website, a pack of 12 bottles at 16oz is $21.99 and $17.99 if you subscribe to have them continuously shipped. I find that very unreasonable. It’s water. With a little bit of flavor. I go through 12 bottles fairly fast because I drink a lot of liquids, especially during the summer. I noticed they had 12 packs of 32oz bottles and figured that would be the best way to go. However, at $32.99 per 12 pack, I couldn’t rationalize it. It’s not any cheaper on Amazon.

So while o really like Hint water overall, I feel their prices are highway robbery. I did place an order on their website a couple months ago. They have a deal for new customers where you get to choose 3 packs from any of their 12oz 12 packs, and it’s $36 dollars. I find that reasonable.

At some grocery stores a bottle is $0.89, at others it’s $2.50 for 16oz.

Now don’t get me wrong. I have no problem paying extra for something I really like. I’m a conscious shopper, but I don’t just grab the cheapest of everything. I will pay a premium for a product I really like, but $2.50 for a 16oz bottle of semi, semi flavored is a once in awhile splurge, not something that’s on the weekly grocery list.",positive

I am a mosquito MAGNET in a very mosquito-heavy area, and this thing is a godsend. Creams almost never help me with super itchy bites, it's like putting regular lotion on them. There were times when I had really bad bites and I resorted to ice packs or painfully hot water to make the itch stop. For so long I've wondered why we don't have a better solution for such a common irritation. When I saw this tool, I couldn't buy it fast enough, and I now swear by it. About 75% of the time, after I use it, the bite stops itching promptly and flattens by the next day. MAGIC!!!! Before this tool, I had bites that stayed swollen and itchy for over a week. (The other 25% are bites that I noticed too late since sometimes I have a delayed reaction.)

I do have a particular way of using it that deviates slightly from the recommended steps. First, I do at least 4 full pumps every time. Yes, it gives me a tiny hickey/bruise, but I don't care!!!! Second, I follow it with a quick swipe of rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer, because I don't want anything lingering on the skin post-suck. I highly recommend this method to anyone with ultra-sensitive skin like mine.

To the makers of this product: THANK YOU. I only wish it had existed sooner.",positive
41,Amazon Launchpad,"Bug Bite Thing Suction Tool, Poison Remover - Bug Bites and Bee/Wasp Stings, Natural Insect Bite Relief - White",$9.95 - $24.99,5,"I've used this little gadget for several years now and love, love, love it! I've since purchased more and shared with all my friends. Only one friend said she didn't have much luck with it on one of her children. I suspect it was not used correctly or it was too long after getting the bite. Yes, you can give yourself a sort of hickey with it, but in my experience, that has been from keeping the suction on too long. I go with the max 20 seconds, and that's fine in most areas, but you can do less and also try not pulling the plunger all the way. Usually it just leaves a slight indentation and maybe a little pink circle for 10-20 minutes. You're better to go back and use it once or twice again after a bite only if necessary. Usually once is enough for me. I have found that the back area is also more likely to have the darker circle appear, so go easy there until you know how your skin will react. My son and I have both used it on our faces for the appropriate amount of time, and not had any problems.
Given my reaction to mosquito bites and how long I react to them (apparently in my older age I've become very allergic and the itch lasts for weeks, not days, and it's awful!), a brief pink circle is worth it. I'm buying more now because I want a couple on each floor of my house, in my car, in my suitcase, etc. I never want to be without it in the summer!!
On another note, my husband, who apparently has very thick skin and never gets mosquito bites, has watched me use The Bug Bite Thing for years but he was still skeptical. He got stung by a bee recently and I suggested that he try it. He was amazed that it took the sting out immediately and it was like it had never happened.",positive

I've actually purchased several of these. Are they a miracle? Yes and no. Here's the thing..it works best if you use it right after you've been bitten. I am HORRIBLY allergic to mosquito bites. I will swell up at times up to the size of a silver dollar. My bites will itch terrible for days and most times I will end up scratching until they bleed. I carry my bug bite thing with me any time I go outside. I'd say 85% of the time if I get it right away I get instant relief. Sometimes especially if I don't use it right away I may have to use the BBT 2-3 times before it works. The thing is, it usually almost always works for (with the exception of places that don't have enough padding to allow for suction such as ankles, elbows, fingers etc). None of the itch creams have ever worked for me and this is literally the only thing that provides relief for me when I get mosquito bites. If you're on the fence about it, give it a try if you're like me and find yourself scratching constantly it may just be what you need.",positive
43,Amazon Launchpad,"Bug Bite Thing Suction Tool, Poison Remover - Bug Bites and Bee/Wasp Stings, Natural Insect Bite Relief - White",$9.95 - $24.99,5,"Adding my comments for fellow sufferers—those of us whose first thought before venturing outside in the summer is how to ward off the biting insects as well as we can because we get huge, ugly welts that torture us and linger for more than a week. Still haven’t found the miracle preventive spray but now, having tried the Bug Bite Thing, at least there’s an effective treatment for the itchy bites. I’ve tried so many anti-itch creams and liquids, Benadryl, ice, you name it. If they work at all, the effect is super temporary. Then I read about this silly-sounding piece of plastic, and, with great skepticism, bought it, thinking it probably won’t work but at least it seems pretty harmless and it’s not expensive. But it works! Never been happier to be wrong! Does it really “suck out the toxins?” I don’t know. All I can say is I’ve tried it on several bites in the past few months and it has done the trick every time. Immediate, lasting relief. I will never leave home without this in my bag.

One caution: I read lots of reviews before buying and saw some horror stories from people who used it on their face and neck, and got bruises/weird swelling. The packaging does say not to do this. Sorry there’s an off-limits area of skin but this device is still so worth it!",positive
44,Amazon Launchpad,"Bug Bite Thing Suction Tool, Poison Remover - Bug Bites and Bee/Wasp Stings, Natural Insect Bite Relief - White",$9.95 - $24.99,5,"I vouch for this bad boy. Try to get to a bite as soon as possible, but I've used it hours later to good effect. I can still see the bite afterwards, but the itching pretty much goes away–most often entirely. I should mention that I tend not to have too strong a reaction to bites, but my family finds it just as effective and most bites can do them nasty. I tend to be aggressive with the suction and that can lead to hickies, but I want that bug mess out. Worst case I sometimes have to try again the next day, but I'm not complaining. We're fighting an asymmetrical battle here, so I'll take any advantage I can get, and this is that.",positive

So for the price, why not try it? I will say this product is absolutely amazing and does work but ONLY if you can catch it almost right away vs hours later. I keep one in my purse and use it the second I notice a bite. The bite will continue to itch for a few minutes, but if you leave it alone it is completely gone an hour later. It does help a little if you notice a bite later on, maybe cuts the healing time in half. All in all though, I can't believe it. Game changer.",positive

The bump was still there, but it didn't itch. I've now used it several times and had one I had to scratch the top a bit (it was a couple days in) and used the bug bite thing and it brought a spot of blood out and no more itch!

48,Amazon Launchpad,"Bug Bite Thing Suction Tool, Poison Remover - Bug Bites and Bee/Wasp Stings, Natural Insect Bite Relief - White",$9.95 - $24.99,5,"I was really amazed at how well this worked during first use. About an hour ago my 3 year old told me she had a bump on her foot. She said it was hurting and itching. I don’t know what bit her. But it was big and I could tell it was fresh. I followed the instructions by using it 2-3 times and for the duration it suggested. I literally saw the bump get smaller right before my eyes. She told me it feels better and that it doesn’t itch anymore. Wow!

Word of advice: PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOW THEM! I remember reading reviews on this product before I bought it…reading things like, “Don’t use it on your face and neck because it leaves a big mark!” or “it doesn’t work” or “I used it and after one suction it didn’t work!”. Honestly, I’m starting to think these people simply did not follow the instructions. For example, the instructions says not to use it on your face or neck. The instructions also say to use the suction tool 2-3 times instead of just once on the bite. The instructions also say to use it right away at first sight of the bite before your body has time to fully react to the venom. So….if you don’t follow those instructions, of course you’re not going to be satisfied!

Also, do follow the instructions for use on kids as well. It stated to only pull the suction half way and for a lesser duration period than for an adult or older child. Please do that! I didn’t do it and it did hurt my 3 year old a little bit. It’s not supposed to hurt. If you follow the instructions, it won’t hurt.",positive

My husband and daughters have though. They say it works, except if you get a mosquito bite on an awkward place. For example, my oldest had one on her ankle bone and was unable to use it there. You are the one completely in control of the suction, so people who complain about that, are using it wrong. Also, the packing states not to use on your face, or any other skin that is more sensitive. There are no chemicals with this as it is only using suction power to remove venom or saliva to stop the itching.",positive

*indicates review for this product

AM- hydrating, lightweight, works under makeup

Cleanser -  BOOTS Botanics All Bright Gentle Cleansing Cream  (purchased from Ulta for a fraction of the price $6.99)

First Toner-  Mario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater, 4 oz. – $7.00 - This is like a drink of water for your face. I love this stuff and will spray again randomly throughout the day whenever I need a refresher. The aroma is a little strong for my liking but (almost like perfume) but I’m willing to overlook since the rose and aloe does so much for my skin. I used to use just straight rose water which has a very present smell but I like the spray delivery of this product better.

Moisturizing Toner- [Skin Food] Premium Avocado Rich Toner 180ml  –$12.98 - I can’t say enough about this. It’s a nice thick toner much more substantial that the western watery toners I was used to. The smell of this is very bright and green (that’s the best way I can think of to explain it) I love the smell! Every now and then I will smell it on my face and it gives me an invigorating boost. This toner works well to moisturize and calm my skin and will certainly be re-purchasing. A little goes a long way with this stuff so that won’t be for quite some time!

Treatment-  Body Merry Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Anti-aging with Vitamic C and Natural Green Tea, 2 Oz – $13.99 - I use this during the day to keep my skin feeling hydrated and give my skin the boost of anti-oxidants to help combat ageing. This is a lightweight serum (which is why I use it under my makeup) but it does take some time to fully absorb in and dry on my skin. After I put this on I generally go and have breakfast before coming back to finish. The aroma leans more towards green tea which again I find refreshing for the morning. The syrup is a milky and slightly viscous with minimal stickiness.

Eye Cream-  Loreal Revitalift Eye Cream 0.5 Ounce (14ml)  (14ml) – (Purchased from Ulta)

Face Cream-  [MIZON] Snail Recovery Gel Cream 45ml (1.52 fl.oz.) Pack of 2 – $9.99/ 2-pack - Lightweight moisturizer which works perfectly under makeup. This product doesn’t’ have much of a smell. The consistency is unique halfway between a gel and a cream. Glides on smoothly and provides a decent amount of hydration when combines with my other hydrating products. I don’t like to use occlusive products during the day and this moisturizer fits the bill.

PM-all about Snail- Repair, Hydrated, Moisturize

Makeup Remover-  Boots Botanics All Bright Soothing Eye Make-up Remover 5 oz.  – Purchased at Ulta for a fraction of the price - $6.99

Double Cleanse - [Total 2Pcs] The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Oil + Foam SET  –$14.21 - The oil cleanser feels light and silky. At night, I massage 1 pump into my skin and works well to dissolve the days make-up. Once I am done breaking down all the makeup, I use water to get some of it off before moving to the foam cleanser. My only complaint is that the fragrance is a little strong and can burn my eyes if I’m not careful. It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. The foam cleanser works well to clean off the oil left on my face. The foam cleanser aroma is a lot more tolerable to me. It comes out of the tube a shimmery white color and is Very gentle. These two cleansers work well to get my face clean and ready for treatments without that typical tight feeling. They leave my skin soft and moisturized.

Exfoliation -  Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion & Peel System Microdermabrasion Treatment 1 Kit  - $21.99 - one a week - I used to use philosophy's microderm kit but this one offers the same exact results for 1/2 of the price. This exfoliator leaves my skin feeling baby soft but it does seem a tad harsh so I don't like to use it too frequently. I love the fresh citrus smell of the crystals and the warming foaming action once you put on the activator. Since I only use this once a week it lasts for a VERY long time and is totally worth the price.

Toner-  [Skin Food] Premium Avocado Rich Toner 180ml  –$12.98 I can’t say enough about this. It’s a nice thick toner much more substantial that the western watery toners I was used to. The smell of this is very bright and green (that’s the best way I can think of to explain it) I love the smell! Every now and then I will smell it on my face and it gives me an invigorating boost. This toner works well to moisturize and calm my skin and will certainly be re-purchasing. A little goes a long way with this stuff so that won’t be for quite some time!

*Essence -  [Cosrx] Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence 100ml  – $15.85 - I only use this at night because it does leave bit of a film on my face which I find unpleasant under make up. It dries quickly and a single pump gives me enough to cover my whole face and neck. There is no smell to speak of but it does have a slimy snail-y texture ( it is 96% slime!) and can be a bit tacky once its all said and done. I have also used this on some iron burns to help it heal faster and minimize scaring with a lot of success.

Treatment- MIZON Snail Repair Intensive Ampoule - Anti Wrinkle - Multi Function Formula  - $11.43 - Anti Wrinkle - Multi Function Formula- Clear viscous liquid. Not nearly as slimy as the essence. No smell, absorbs quickly. I focus heavily on the snail products at night because I read that the copper peptides naturally contained in the snail can
alter the effectiveness of the vitamin C and vice versa.

Spot Treatment- [MIZON] Acence Blemish Out Pink Spot 30ml – $14.95 - Use only as needed – Works wonders to diminish blemishes overnight. I used this quite frequently when I first started but after a while using all these products I didn’t have any acne to speak of!

Sheet Mask -  Dermal Korea Collagen Essence Full Face Facial Mask Sheet, 16 Combo Pack  – $10.40 - I use once a week. I know that sheet masks are the totally hot thing in Korean beauty but I don’t think they do much for me other than a relaxing home spa experience. I just don’t see that they provide much and probably will not be buying more.

Eye Cream-  MIZON Korean Cosmetics Snail Repair Eye Cream, 1 Ounce  1 Ounce – $13.98 - Light weight, absorbs quickly. The container is quite generous and a little will go a long way. I think I will have this for a while! It doesn’t have any smell.

Face Cream-  MIZON Black Snail All In One Cream, 2.40 Ounce  –$10.49 - Like all of the Mizon Snail products I have tried this is a very easy introduction into the world of snail skin care. It has minimum smell and lightweight texture. Minimal slime factor, you wouldn’t even know it was snail in a blind comparison. It has a off white color and a lightweight consistency. It doesn’t work wall as an occlusive if that’s what you want you may need to add a different moisturizer at night.

Face Oils- I use a mixture of two oils applied at once:  Radha Beauty Rosehip Oil 4 oz - 100% Pure Cold Pressed Certified Organic . - $13.95 - and  Radha Beauty Moroccan Argan Oil for Hair, Face & Skin 4 oz - USDA Organic 100% Pure Cold pressed Virgin Oil From Morocco - By Radha Beauty  –$12.95 - I like to use the oils last because I feel like it really seals everything in and provides moisture to last me through the night. The rosehip oil is very yellow orange so I wouldn’t recommend using during the day abut I do sometimes mix the Argan oil in with my foundation if I want a dewier look.",positive

If you try to use this product as a standalone moisturizer, it will exacerbate any dryness you have, or could cause issues with dryness. BUT, heretofore, I was not able to use a more occlusive moisturizer… anything heavier than a gel consistency clogged y pores and broke me out. But using this product as an intermediary has not only helped my pores, fine lines, and moisture retention, it has helped me be able to layer heavier creams on top without breakouts. I cleanse with CeraVe hydrating cleanser, then layer this essence on a damp face. I let it sit until tacky, then follow up with the CeraVe moisturizing cream.

I recently was turned on to Korean skin care for their more bearable sunscreen and I came across this. I was intrigued that is was snail mucus, I mean you can’t get more natural than that, so for the 16 bucks I purchased it (also knowing Amazon has a great return policy helps). About a month later I am really impressed. The snail mucus really does help with retaining the moisture in my skin. My skin looks very plump which is something with aging skin is important. And after using it this long I am kinda in love with the fact that it’s snail mucus, because snails have to retain their moisture in order to live and their slime is used as a lubricant to move, or heal their abrasions. I don’t know I just think it’s really neat. (No make up in photos)",positive

I use about a pump and a half both in the morning and before bed, right after washing my face (but before other serums and moisturizer). I highly recommend!

If you're wondering if you should buy it... go for it. The snails aren't harmed, it lasts forever (I use it at night 3x a week) and it will moisturize, soothe and plump up your skin. Get your skin damp before using it because of the hyaluronic acid. Give it 2 weeks of consistent use and you'll see results. I just wish it were in sustainable packaging :(",positive

The key is to take your time plotting where you are going to install the mount, before peeling back the adhesive. I try to find the optimal location where the phone does not hinder my driveline site, yet is a quick glance away. I make sure that the edge of the bottom bracket is lightly touching the dashboard so as to ease the pressure on the mount. I flex the mount in every direction to make sure my iPhone can easily get in and out. The only time I have experienced any issues is when I have left my truck out in the blazing sun and the adhesive gets soft. This lowers the unit, but all I need to do is rinse the mounting bracket with warm water, let it dry, and it re-adheres like new.",positive

The 1st one I had years ago was great with unbeatable suction for the dashboard just fine, but I accidently broke the suction bar because it was difficult to remember for sure which direction it meant to move; thus, I've been on the journey of finding a replacement for many years. I've tried a bunch of the ones where supposedly you could attach to the vents.... well, maybe, but definitely not the 2004 model. The vents are so loose that they couldn't hold the weight of any cell phones prob not even the Samsung mini flip phone. Fast forward to this product, I tried using the suction way on the windshield so I didn't have to put it on the dashboard... well, it didn't last overnight. I was about to return it then I finally tried the sticker suction way on the dashboard. I was trying to avoid this version since it's more permanent than the windshield, but at least it worked and stayed on without any problems for about a month or so now.

Other models of phone holders will either not stay mounted to the dash, or they will not hold my large model phones that will always be wrapped with a protective case. This iOttie, of which I have had two, has always stayed solidly mounted where I have installed it. It has been able to hold the weight of the phone with the case (S21 Ultra + Otterbox), and the attaching mechanism has never failed even after many months of daily use. The previous one lasted for several years.

The other nice attribute is the ability of this device to move in so many directions in order to place the phone in the position I need it in. The dash on my truck is a bit odd and I don't like my phone in my line of sight. I was able to create a way for my phone to be placed lower and still have rigidity. I've been very happy with iOttie products. I generally purchase the more simple models. I don't need the more complex ones. However, I am sure they would be very well made.",positive

I bought this one after my old mount would lose suction and fall off if the weather was too hot or too cold, oftentimes it would fall when I was driving, and that was very dangerous.

The mount by iOttie has been stuck to my windshield for 10 months now and stayed on during sub freezing days and days where the temperature reached well over 100!

The spring loaded clamp is so hassle free and holds your device in place, and no need to squeeze the sides because it automatically clamps down on your phone when you push it against the back of the holder!

I work on a construction site where huge bumps and potholes are very frequent and this thing never shakes lose and keeps my phone secured.

I have an iPhone 13 pro max and it fits perfectly.

Get rid of those janky holders where you have to contort and bend the support arm just to get it in the right position. Keep it sweet and simple.

One little issue that I wasn't very bothered by was that the dash mount didn't work for me. But this is largely because of the way my dashboard is. If you're looking for this to mount on your dash just make sure your dash is flat enough and not made of a slick material.

Other than that this mount is perfect!

74,Amazon Launchpad,iOttie Easy One Touch Dashboard & Windshield Universal Car Mount Phone Holder Desk Stand,$16.99 - $24.99,5,"For some reason there wasn't a single phone mount that fit my car, so I bought this one. The Kia Rio 2019 is weirdly designed and there really isn't a good spot for a phone mount. I put it above the touch screen radio and it has to block my screen a little bit, but it's better than blocking my view of the road. The most important thing for me was to be able to clearly see the road because my phone mount before blocked the road and it was so scary to drive with.
I love that I can use one hand to put my phone in and take it out. My phone is very secure and never falls out. I also like that I can adjust the arm and the angle.

I can't get my phone low enough due to logistics of the holder. The angle would make the phone screen unviewable.

It is still attached very strongly. This holder is a welcome safety feature for quickly referencing navigation directions.",positive
77,Amazon Launchpad,iOttie Easy One Touch Dashboard & Windshield Universal Car Mount Phone Holder Desk Stand,$16.99 - $24.99,5,"Background info:
I bought the Easy One Touch 4 in the fall of 2018 because of its features and price. I still use the original because it still works and nothing ground-breaking has come out--all it needs to do is hold a phone. The only problem I had with the Easy One Touch 4 was the adhesive coming off after a few months, but I was able to get a replacement [via RMA] in a few days. I've bought the Easy One Touch 4 several more times for family and friends based on the price/performance ratio and the after sale support. I wanted to see if the Easy One Touch 5 had made any major improvements, so I went ahead and ordered it.

Packaging:
The packaging is roughly the same, although the sizing chart had been removed and the stock image now shows the mount being used in a ""luxury"" vehicle; this tells me that the company is trying to move upstream [which is fine], but outside of Lyft/Uber, I don't think most people would use a phone mount if their car already has
infotainment/GPS built in. The packaging does look nicer and the color palette remains the same. The font has also appeared to change, but I doubt anyone cares much about the packaging except for environmentally conscientious individuals. Every component inside receives its own bag--this is likely to prevent dust and/or damage to the adhesive. Aside from fully sealing the outermost box, this is the best option. The manual contains multiple languages and instructs on how to adjust the newest feature; a magnetic charging cable holder; more on this later.

First Impressions:
The piano gloss black has been removed in favor of a less fingerprint prone matte black and the ""push panel"" has been upgraded to a more subdued and trim less soft-touch rubber. The push panel, which is used to automatically retract the arms, no longer bears the brand name, but gains a texture. This design choice is intelligent because
it lowers tooling cost and looks more premium--something the packaging is also trying to convey. All rubber grips have been slightly altered to provide a surface with more grip and depth to help hold a phone securely. I did not have any issues with devices falling out, but it is good to see.

More Details:
The suction cup and tab mechanism is largely unchanged and intuitive; no reason to fix what already works. As a side note, the instructions clearly state a ""curing"" time and temperature to mount the base and arm. If you do not adhere to the instructions, the adhesive will not form a strong bond and may fall off. Additionally, if you have a car where the dashboard is made of rubber or has been recalled for something like UV degradation (google car dashboard melting recalls), you may have an issue with the adhesive regardless--this isn't to say it won't work, but if you have a mid-2000s Toyota Camry and park in the sun, you might find that the suction cup has melted.

The Magnetic Cord Organizer:
Inside the box you will see a small black strip of rubber with 2 magnets on opposite ends [similar shape to a Breathe Right strip]. This is to wrap around your charging cable so it doesn't fall away between your chair and center console or anywhere else you wouldn't want it to fall. There is enough clearance for most phones and cases for the cable to rest in a neutral place and everyone I've showed it to did not have any issues using it with their phone.

Changes:
The arm now extends an additional 3 inches (8 total) in case you have a very long dashboard or want your phone to be as close to you as possible. The tension mount on the back of the device is now thicker, stronger, and has better quality threading--it is easier to work with when compared to last year's model. The feet are still adjustable, but the position of the feet is no longer controlled by a dial; the same piece of plastic used to hold the magnetic cord organizer can now be pushed (gently) towards to user and moved up or down depending on the height of the phone.

Notes:
There are wireless charging variants of this device, but I feel that the cost increase is not worth it--you still have to touch your phone to mount it, it takes 3-5 seconds to plug in your phone and the cable will already be directly underneath the mount.

TL;DR Its the best car mount available [that I am aware of] in its price bracket.",positive

I have a smaller phone (iPhone 12 Mini) and it holds it just fine with minimal vibration. However, I have mine mounted with the extendable arm collapsed all of the way, so I don’t know how it would perform extended with a heavier phone.

90,Amazon Launchpad,SHEETS LAUNDRY CLUB LAUNDRY_DETERGENT,$16.65 - $62.99,5,"These are fantastic. Simple as can be. Just toss part of a sheet in with your laundry (I just toss mine right on top of my load) and you're done.

And economical. I compared the price when I bought them to the liquid detergent I had been using and it was no contest at all. I did find some cheaper powder options, but not by as much as I would have expected. These were clearly on the low end of the spectrum and for me the effectiveness, simplicity and lack of mess mean they more than pay for themselves. You'll find lower cost options but I can't imagine feeling like these are exorbitant.

One of the greatest things is the flexibility. The sheets are sized according to the most detergent you're likely to need in any load. I end up using half a sheet for normal loads, a quarter sheet for small loads, and 3/4 for really big loads or just a little extra oomph. I don't think I've ever used a full sheet; you'll get far more loads out of these than there are sheets.

I find them perfectly effective, performing on par with other detergents we've used. Laundry needs at our house are pretty basic. Our clothes get lived in before we wash, but we don't deal with a ton of major stains and odors constantly. I've got some everyday stains out with these alone. I've paired these with regular bleach and had good results, so I reckon you could use other additives with them just fine. But check out some other reviews if you think you need something heavier-duty than I've needed these for, or if you have particular sensitivities.

Another thing worth noting, I've had bad luck with powder in general in the past, with it not dissolving properly, especially in cold water; which is a small majority of my laundry. For our basic uses, these seem to dissolve no problem. I've never found any residue or anything either in the washer afterward or on any clothes.

Past that, I've found storage and tidiness are side benefits. This tiny box as opposed to a huge tub? Yes please. The cardboard isn't so strong you'll reuse the box after, but it's as sturdy as it needs to be and the ""drawer"" design lets you save partial sheets on top of the stack for next time. Neat as a pin, with no drips or grains to wipe up after. Keep it high enough that nothing wet will spill on it and give your shelf some breathing room.

What else... fresh scent that's not overly strong, obviously all the ecological and sustainability benefits... I may tinker around with other laundry options when it's time to replace these just to experiment but these set a high bar for our needs.",positive

For heavy soils, I add 'splash' of Oxy Clean. We're so used to pouring liquid or powders from a jug, or using pods, also from a plastic container. If I can take one plastic item off my list that may or may not really be recycled, that's one less item floating in the ocean.

The cardboard box that they come in keeps them fresh, it's compact, and recyclable. If you leave the box open the sheets will get a little stale and start to firm up but they still work fine like that.
I always put them on the top of the load so the water hits it directly, and I've never had any issues with it not desolving or becoming gummy (cold wash works as well.)
Haven't tried the subscribe and save yet with them but I've been using them for 14 months. I've gone through four boxes total. Sometimes I do split the sheet in half for a smaller load but one sheet does a large/extra large load just fine.",positive
96,Amazon Launchpad,SHEETS LAUNDRY CLUB LAUNDRY_DETERGENT,$16.65 - $62.99,4,"I love these laundry sheets. I was glad to finally find a version that comes in fully recyclable packaging. I am not a fan of the linen scent, but it isn't overbearing or offensive, I just prefer fragrance free soaps whenever possible. It is my fault for not noticing this was for the Linen Scent and not the Scent Free version that I have ordered in the past. I have sensitive skin and can get rashes or itchy from many detergents. I have not had that reaction to these sheets.

Ease of Use: I have a top loading washing machine and I usually tear up a single sheet into small pieces and drop them in while allowing the washer to fill up with the lid open before putting clothes in. I will swish the water around with my hand to get the sheet dissolved before putting clothes in the water to avoid the potential for the sheet leaving residue on clothes, however I have also tossed the sheet in after loading clothes and have not had the issue other reviews mention of residue. I think the trick is making sure the sheet is directly under the water flow to make sure it gets dissolved before the wash cycle starts.

What I LOVE: I hate paying for water so buying liquid laundry soap seemed like such a waste, not to mention the extra energy that is required to truck heavy jugs to stores and again to my house. Concentrates are my friend and these are an ideal version of concentrates. I find my clothes are just as clean as with other soaps and I can usually do a large load with a single sheet. If I am washing really dirty things from the dog or from yardwork/ garage use I may use 1 1/2 sheets. Small loads of delicates can easily use just 1/2 sheet.

NOTE: The cardboard packaging is great for me, but it would be a bit of a headache for people in very humid climates as the moisture would get inside the packaging and maybe make the sheets stick to each other. In high humidity you would need to store these in a container with a desiccant packet to keep the moisture at bay.",positive

Almond or coconut milks just didn’t taste as good as dairy in my coffee but oat milk is an excellent alternative. I usually buy Oatly or Planet Oat from the grocery store. But I’m so attached to my morning oat latte that I needed a shelf stable version to take on travel. Suffice it to say, oat milk is not yet widely available everywhere. I stumbled onto California farms. The quart size is perfect for packing into your suitcase! The taste is good and it makes for a creamy coffee in a pinch. However, I could not get it to froth in my frother. Might just be my frother but it has no problem frothing the other brands. I will definitely be buying more of this to travel with but for home use, I’ll stick to the grocery brands that froth a bit better.",positive
111,Amazon Launchpad,Califia Farm,$21.48 - $52.99,4,"I really think Calafia Farms makes pretty good products. Not to say others don't.
I use oat milk in my coffee to get away from dairy as the lactose bothers me and keeps my weight on.
I really loved an oat milk latte I had at Peet's Coffee and learned they use Pacific Foods Barista Blend (but too pricey)
I was buying Calafia Farms from the grocery store until I saw the shelf stable cartons which is convenient. It doesn't take up room in the refrigerator and risk of running out is low. Just go to your pantry for the next carton!
I was going to re-order today but the product went up over $4 for the carton and I think it's too pricey. It's only oats! Not nuts! I guess it's pricing on popularity.
I will be making my own in the blender. I can use organic oats and purified water. It takes 30 seconds (only and not more) You can tweak to your taste if adding salt or a touch of sunflower oil and costs pennies on the dollar.",positive

My doctor recently told me it might be worth it to try going dairy free and as much as I love dairy I did notice feeling crappy after eating dairy products. I can't have nut milks because I feel crappy if I eat too many nuts, so I started trying oat milk. I tried the regular Califia Oat Milk and didn't like it, it tasted burnt to me. I also tried a few others like Ripple and didn't like them either. I stumbled across this Barista Blend while searching for something else to try.

I really like it and even gave a carton to a friend for her daughter who has a casein allergy because I knew they'd been having a hard time finding something she liked. They were happy with it as well. Her mom even made whipped cream with it and everyone was surprised by how well it turned out.

I use it in my coffee everyday and for cooking/baking. I have some Krusteaz gluten free boxed baking mixes and used it to make a cake which was amazing. Usually they end up a little dry but this one was perfectly moist and tasted so good I wanted to scarf the whole thing down right away.

This Califia Farms Oat Barista Blend is quite good. Very creamy, thanks to sunflower oil. On the rare occasion I make my own oat milk, to get a creamy taste and mouth feel the use of sunflower lecithin or sunflower oil is the key.

I havent tried frothing this, I just use a health splash in my coffee. I will use this in a pinch for any other milk or cream needs. It has a neutral taste. I think oat milk is the best milk for anyone who prefers cow milk but are open to plant based milks. It just has the best taste and mouth feel.

That being said, get them from a grocery store. I ordered these on Amazon and the first package arrived a week later (why so long?) so the ice pack had long melted. The gummies had melted and congealed into a solid mass. I requested a replacement and was told I could just keep the solid jar of gummies, which I ended up throwing away. The second order, again for some reason, was sent regular mail and showed up a week later. Same story: the ice pack had long melted and the gummies were a solid, nasty mass. This time Amazon wanted me to return the gummies to them (why? who knows) before they would issue a refund. It's been two weeks since I dropped them off at the UPS store (which was scanned right when I dropped them off) and I have yet to receive a refund.

131,Amazon Launchpad,OLLY Women's Multivitamin Gummy,$12.78 - $37.99,5,"UPDATE 07.23.22:
I am very pleased to say, the “vitamin” smell and taste disappeared largely after the first couple of days.

After they had a chance to “air out,” These are pleasingly palatable. I also do not get sick with these after consumption like I experienced with One a Day Women’s.

If you experience hypersensitivities to flavors, I recommend opening the gummies and giving them time to release the “vitamin air” that seems to linger in brand new bottles. These became surprisingly enjoyable in less than a week, so trying them is a must.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Right now, where I live we have triple digit heat, so I was curious to see if my gummies would turn into a gummy steak.

Amazon did a fantastic job insulating the gummies in this heat. Everyone is still in tact.

Will update this review in a few weeks regarding my opinion on the gummies.

First impression, these are definitely vitamins, I can taste them, like the flavor of an additive-free One-A-Day, in gummy form.

If you are hypersensitive to flavors, I do not recommend this. These are not like Welch’s fruit snacks, however they are palatable to an average person for the time it takes to chew 2, it seems.",positive

140,Amazon Launchpad,ALOHA Organic Plant Based Protein Bars,$19.19 - $45.25,5,"Over the past two years, I have developed a gluten sensitivity as well as a corn sensitivity (and living in Iowa makes ""no corn"" a big problem! Man, I miss popcorn and sweet corn!). Most of the protein bars on the market have gluten or corn in them (corn can be used as corn syrup, corn starch, maltodextrin, dextrose, and more). So it has been hard to find a protein bar that I can grab for a quick breakfast when I am in a hurry or running late.

So I was thrilled to find this Aloha bar that is both corn and gluten free. The taste has been excellent (I've only tried one other flavor - Sea Salt Caramel - but I preferred this Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip), and I've had zero stomach or bowel issues from it.

My only complaint is that it is just a touch pricey. But for its quality and ability to fit my dietary needs, I'll happily keep paying it.",positive

Aloha bar with peanut butter and chocolate chip is great. It's tasty enough that I can eat it every day and I pretty much always enjoy it. I've eaten these nearly every morning for half a year now and I still enjoy it. I'm sure eventually I'll have to stop eating them because I get tired of it. But for now I still like it. And they have helped me get back to the weight I was in my mid-20s. The fiber makes you feel full for hours and the protein helps build muscle.

They are easy to chew. Overall a great product, the container is a cool shape and size, looks good sitting in the fridge where I keep them. This isnt required but the kids like them better cold.

The only thing to note as far as I can tell. Be super careful with the heat as theyll melt into a giant glob. When I got mine it was fine as far as delivery, but I left the container in the car in the sun, and even though it really wasnt super hot out, the greenhouse effect of sun and rolled up windows made them pretty melty.

Even though the pimples were large (half an inch wide on the big one), I put the small size patch on, and it still worked excellently. They did not fall off as I slept.

I sprayed SkinSmart antimicrobial therapy on the area immediately after I took off the patch to disinfect the area (works for killing all skin bacteria, including acne and boils.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N0O0TV7/

I use Queene Helene Triple Whipped Cleansing Cream as a face wash at night. This causes my face to exfoliate half a day later so I wash again with regular Kirk's Soap and when my skin is wet, scrap off the excess skin with a rough wash cloth. My skin sheds a lot, though. An abnormal amount, I think. Sometimes I use a soft children's tooth brush to exfoliate it.

If my skin is dry, I use Tea Tree Therapy brand Antiseptic Cream. This helps a relative with itchy dry eczema, it also kills bacteria well. If you apply it with a soft tooth brush, it exfoliates and moisturizes at the same time.
Other times I use Hollywood Beauty Tea Tree Oil, it is a blend of tea tree oil and carrier oils that helps my acne, too.
Tea tree oil kills bacteria.

Sometimes after using the eczema spray I.mentioned earlier, after it has dried and I wipe off any remaining saline solution (which is what the eczema spray breaks down into after 1p minutes), I spray Probiotic Action Emerald Spray. This sprays good bacteria that is naturally found on a healthy face, Bacillus subtilis, onto your face. This good bacteria eats the food of what bad acne causing bacteria uses to thrive on your skin, restoring bacterial balance to your skin and causing the bad bacteria to die.

Obviously, if you are spraying good bacteria onto your face, you cannot use any other products, except these stickers (but the spray won't get on the sticker part, just other acne spots). Most products for the face (lotions, acne medicines, also makeup if you wear it) have preservatives in them to kill bacteria. This is really good or your product would go bad in its jar. But that means you CAN'T use the good bacteria and the other products at the same time or you are just wasting the good bacteria because it's going to be killed by the preservatives in your other product.

You cannot put the good bacteria from the Emerald spray into a clear spray bottle, either. The light will eventually kill the bacteria. The good bacteria will live long enough on your face to eat the bad acne-causing bacteria's food though, so you don't have to hide in the dark after you spray good bacteria on.

(You see online a lot people with yogurt masks. Yogurt contains good bacteria, yes, but it's only anerobic bacteria, meaning it needs an oxygenless environment — your stomach — to work. You will never get the benefit of good bacteria by using yogurt on your face because your face is not an oxygenless environment. Whomever says you can benefit from a yogurt mask is not being honest, usually out of ignorance.

I've also learned that some East Asian companies put, or claim to put, Bacillus subtilis in creams and face washes along with other products. Obviously, as said before, the other ingredients in the creams and face washes, as well as the preservatives in these products, will kill the good bacteria. Don't fall for any product that claims to use this bacteria in it along with other products, the company isn't honest, or they are poor researchers, and you definitely are not getting the benefit of the good bacteria.)

Also, the following supplements have really helped:

I take × 2 Vita Breeze 95% Curcuminoids with Black Pepper Extract to reduce inflammation; 95% means your body uses 95% of the curcumin, unlike regular curcumin that your body uses very little of the actual curcuminoids, which are what reduces inflammation. Start slow with the curcuminoids, one every other day for a while, then one a day, then after a while one a day. Research 95% curcuminoids: they kill cancer — and thus prevent cancer — they are as effective as prozac for treating depression and if you take prozac they enhance the benefits of prozac, they help with arthritis, and they help your cognition. A lot of medical research which originated from Baylor University is about 95% curcumins.

A lot of people try to sell you curcumin and it isn't the 95% curcuminoids. All research and medical benefits are ONLY on the 95% curcuminoids, so don't be duped into wasting money on a curcumin product that isn't 95% curcuminoids.

I also take any brand Saw Palmetto and Milk Thistle, two types of adaptogens safe for men and women that are for balancing hormones, which was recommended by a dermatologist for hormonal-related acne, and a daily vitamin with some zinc for managing acne that could be caused by vitamin deficiency, also recommended by a dermatologist.

For daily vitamins, I use HEB — regular grocery store — brand Adults 50+, even though I'm not that old. It is less expensive and has more vitamins than ones targetted towards younger people or ""men's"" or ""women's"" vitamins, and the vitamins that the one for older people contains help heart and eye health and help prevent problems when you are old and are almost worthless when you've already developed problems with your heart or eyes, so they're really good for people at any age, especially people under 50. Advertisers use warfare's ""divide and conquer"" technique to try to get our money — divide us into groups, conquer our money — so they may say it's for older people, or some other group of people, when in fact it is good for everyone. That way they can charge more money for products aimed at younger people or their targetted group. For vanity's sake, people go along with the labeling because they think it makes them special, but look at the label of your daily vitamin, because it's the contents, not packing or label or even cost, that matters for your health.

A daily vitamin will also have a little vitamin e and a. These are important for many functions in your body and not having enough can cause skin problems. It's your body's way of showing you it isn't healthy. I tried taking zinc, e, and a separately in larger doses, but zinc made me sick and vitamin a is easy to overdose on because it is stored in the liver. I guess because I wasn't very deficient of either. Also I read men who took high doses of E for a long period of time were more likely to develop prostate cancer. I decided the normal doses in a daily vitamin were enough. If you are deficient in any of these vitamins, and you take a daily vitamin long enough, you will no longer be deficient without having to expose yourself to the risks associated with taking higher doses. You will also consistently be getting these vitamins.

All this has helped me more than the thousands I blew on other types of over the counter products (salicylic acid has never helped me nor anyone in my famiky, benzoyl peroxide felt terrible like my skin was paper thin) or sometimes extremely expensive products from certain dermatologists, including antibiotics that I could only take for a limited time before I had to stop or before they made me sick.

I hope this review helps you avoid wasting time and money and avoid getting ripped off and helps improve your overall health.

I also hope it helps open your eyes that acne is not about ""beauty"" so much as it is a reflection of health (hormonal, inflammation, vitamins, bacterial: it's all related). I used to get huge pain cysts, which were considered medically category 5 of acne, and it was a real medical problem that I had to go to doctors for, I always hated that acne treatments fell into the ""beauty"" category online and in stores. I think categorizing it this way prevented me from getting treatment sooner. It is a health issue, and a reflection of health. ThatsThat's probabprobably the reason high quality skin is considered beautiful, because it reflects good health and sound mind. I think wevewe've forgotten that as a culture and turned it into a vain thing, or at least advertisers have, I don't know which came first.

Your skin is your largest organ, take care of it not for looks but to be healthy, like you should all your organs. And don't be embarrassed by people's stupid categorization of acne treatments or how they try to make it a ""vanity"" issue: ignore people's dumb labels and take proper care of your health.

It's the right thing to do, it is very good to do.

God bless.",positive

When peeled off, you can see they've gotten a little bit out. However, it really isn't that much. It's less than COSRX and far less than ZitSticka patches. It makes sense, however, because they are so thin. While that does make them less visible (so for those wearing makeup, that may be a big benefit) it seems to inhibit extraction ability.

Used over something that is in the later stages of healing, it seemed to help calm the skin down some and keep it from getting too dried out. They aren't really strong enough to pull off any scab-type layers, which COSRX can do.

I did really like that they have a rather large size. Like, the large is the size of maybe a nickel (if not a little bigger).

There would be good if you use patches to avoid picking at your skin. They are also good for covering a rough area that is healing. They stay on if you have a spot bleeding you need to cover. They won't go far toward healing a breakout, though.

I almost gave three stars, but gave four because: There were no adverse effects, the price point is lower than others, they didn't fall off my skin, and they did seem to help calm the skin they were applied to.

If I need a ""bonus purchase"" to meet a minimum for free shipping, I would get these again. Otherwise, I would rather divert my money into more effective patches.",positive

I do not understand exactly what voodoo is behind these little patches, but I am not exaggerating when I say they are straight up miracle workers!! I’ve never been blessed with amazing skin, but until recently I took for granted the fact that the only real issue I had was a minor jawline breakout every few months around my cycle. As a 34 year old woman, I thought a pimple every few months was annoying, but was always able to cover it up with a little bit of concealer and move on with my day. I never had a real need for any medicated creams or special products. UNTIL a few months ago when I weaned my nine month old baby, and hell in the form of hormones entered my life. Along with my other less visible symptoms came the most horrid and painful case of cystic acne that there ever was. I woke up one morning with one lesion (not just a pimple), and by bedtime that same night I had two more. By the next morning it had spread over my entire face. I was actually terrified that I had some sort of staph infection. I visited my doctor, and was put on antibiotics to no avail. I was taking ibuprofen all day long for the pain. I went into panic mode and spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on new makeup and every skin care product and every prescription cream known to mankind. Nothing even touched this acne. I was beside myself. I am not being dramatic when I say that I could hardly look in the mirror. I canceled plans. I was embarrassed showing up to work, even contemplating calling in sick some days because it was so bad. I could never have understood the emotional drain that this kind of acne could be until it happened to me. At some point, because the chemical products weren’t working, I decided to try a more natural route. I cut dairy out of my diet. I tried essential oils. I practiced oil pulling every morning. I drank apple cider vinegar. I’m telling you, I was devoted. And, the acme barely budged. I considered going on Accutane, but it didn’t feel like a good fit for the fact that I’d like to have another baby at some point in the relatively near future. So I’m telling you, I was feeling totally hopeless. Then about a week ago, browsing Amazon in bed wondering if there was anything left in the world that I hadn’t tried, I came across these little patches. I wasn’t that excited about them, but they didn’t cost much and they were indeed something different, I figured it was worth a shot. They arrived Tuesday and I put them on overnight. Woke up Wednesday morning and was both impressed and disgusted by what I peeled off. My skin wasn’t irritated and the redness was reduced, but the acne was still very much present. I wore them to bed again on Wednesday night, and woke up the next morning to find that for the first time in months, my skin appeared to be healing. I was so excited that I actually almost cried. When I got home from work that afternoon I washed my face and was so encouraged that I put more patches on and wore them around the house for the rest of the day and evening. I am not kidding when I tell you that I took them off before bed to find that my acne, which had completely withstood the test of every dermatologist recommendation for months, was all but gone. GONE! I could not believe my eyes. I cannot tell you what an insane feeling of gratitude and relief I have for having found this product. If you are suffering with acne, do not hesitate for even one moment to buy these little suckers!",positive

But I do still get a surprise pimple or a surprise patch of pimples sometimes during my time of the month, and of course having to wear a mask everywhere is not helping any. The first time I tried A Pimple patch, I had received a 8pc sample pack of the Corsx brand and I was over the moon. Then, I received a sample of the Avarelle, all 3 sizes and the second I agreed one to my face I already viewed it as a superior product in my opinion. Thankfully, ecru when I do have to contend with a blemish, they are small and minor enough that it only takes 1 6-8hr application of one of these patches and *POOF* I remove the patch to find it all but disappeared, if anything there's nasty be a small spot barely visible that liners for one more day. The reason this brand exceeds any other in my opinion is 1)Most times I first become aware of a pimple in the morning and these patches are true to their claims... The actual patches are so thin and clear when applied to clean skin that it is virtually invisible(sometimes if it catches light at a certain angle it will be slightly noticeable for a moment), but I've learned to fix this by covering it with a very light layer of makeup if I'm wearing any that day. This feature in itself is a selling point because now not only is my blemish invisible, it's also being treated as soon as it's noticed. With the other brand, the patch was not clear, nor was it thin enough to be unnoticeable, so I would only apply them overnight and sometimes that world be irritating if for example, my pimple accidentally popped over the daytime or morphed into a whole new deal. And just because these ones are in fact very thin, does not mean they are any less effective or adhesive. I make sure after I peel the patch off it's base, It's normally stuck right on my fingertip... I just make sure it's centered exactly whet I want it, then lay it down on its center and just press down around the edges to make sure it's sealed.. And it always is. And I mean airtight sealed... Even if I don't apply makeup, I still have a strict skin care routine to perform and nothing gets undernearh or affects the adhesiveness, and I use Toner, Essence, Ampoule, Serums, Moisturizer, SPF, etc. Also, these patches come in 3 different sizes which for me is a huge benefit... Most specifically, the extra large sized ones. On those occasions when I get a little cluster of a breakout, the blemishes are always very close together and usually 1 of the Xtra large patches is big enough to eradicate the whole cluster instead of having to use separate patches on each individual pimple. And last but not least, the Averalle patches have not let me down yet.... Whether I end up applying for a day or for a night, when I remove them, my problem is all but gone and that's a very big deal to me considering I'm a fanatic about my skin care and put a lot of time into it over the years so that even though I'm 41yrs old... No one ever believes me when I first tell them my age. I only buy full size products of smokes received if they seriously impress me which these obviously do.

Occasionally I get extremely large cystic bumps. Example in photos. Before Avarelle, I would squeeze them till a head formed then let it drain which would sometimes take days or even weeks to achieve, causing bruising, bleeding, and often time spreading the cystic to other parts near the spot. I’ve come to realized after multiple uses and brands that these top all. For large spots I use the large patches which seemed excessive at first but much needed in final review. The small variety patches work great on small or even medium spots but sometimes need reapplication because they can only absorb so much. Where the large patches can absorb more so they can handle bigger spots. It took 3 days of back to back large patches which I cut to resolve my forehead cystic spot. God only knows how long the giant horn of a cystic zit would had been on my forehead or how big it would had grown without their being a head to relieve the cyst.

My normal skin color in the summer is paler than most regular white people in the winter. You can see all the pink undertones and the veins and everything. I also have very very textured skin and my legs and arms are always dry and bumpy so very self tanner, application method, and application tool combo I've tried has always resulted in various degrees of streaks and splotches, no matter how much I exfoliate, moisturize, blend, etc. I also am not fond of coconut oil or its smell. I tried a tanning water before this and as long as I blended with a dense self tanning blending brush) until my arm muscles gave out and then some, after a ton of exfoliating and moisturizing, it worked kind of well. I'd still have to scrub my wrists, elbows, toes, around my feet, ankles, armpit creases, and cleavage to get the darker areas lighter and then add more tanner in certain spots on my arms and legs. Still had to wait like 8 hours to shower and still ended up a little orange-y.
With this B.Tan Act Natural, I exfoliated, moisturized rough spots, and then applied with my tanning brush everywhere except my belly and mid and low back. It didn't feel as sticky as other tanners and dried a little more quickly. The coconut smell dissipated after awhile and turned into a less pleasant smell but not horrid. After 1-2 hours I jumped in the shower and gently cleansed my skin with just my hand and some Cetaphil cleanser. I was a little darker by then, which is when the picture here is from. After washing it off and then going to bed, I woke up the next day a little darker too. The tops of my feet and my ankles and wrists were way too dark even though I went very light on product and even wiped lightly with a tissue after blending those areas. On the rest of me though, the color was golden and not orange-y in the slightest, and my skin was very soft and moisturized, and it stayed moisturized after showers with no lotion. This tanner does come off my face VERY quickly though, in like 2 days. I don't wear makeup except once or twice on weekends but I work out almost every day and shower and wash my face with a gentle cleanser, and then I use some micellar water in the mornings.

I’ll start by saying this self tanner is better than most, including the expensive kinds. The tan I got wasn’t as dark as I was hoping for but still looked way better than what most self tanners end result is.
It definitely looked like a natural tan. No orange tint or anything, but when you do apply it don’t be discouraged by the grey color it gives off. It’ll wash off and look like a real tan.
It was fairly easy to apply, just make sure you use a good exfoliant on your body beforehand and make sure you blend it really well.

The cons:

The major downside I had with my experience with it was it went away before the week ended. I applied it to my whole body in two coats. I’m a full time mom of a four month old baby boy and it’s hard to find the time or even the energy sometimes to keep up with something like that when it doesn’t even last a week.
A lot of people say it has no scent as a good thing about it, but it actually does have a somewhat of a smell to it, it just wasn’t a good one. For me personally, I would’ve rather it have some sort of a good perfume scent to it like a light lavender lotion scent instead of slight chemical like smell.
Even though it was fairly easy to apply, I found it was a little bit of a challenge blending it in on the neck, armpit and face even when I exfoliated my whole body and face really good beforehand.

All in all, it’s not a super bad self tanner by any means. I’m definitely not saying not to buy it. If you don’t mind the scent or that it may not last as long as the bottle says then by all means it’s a good purchase. I don’t necessarily regret buying this product and I will definitely give it a second try when I have the chance. I just found that maybe it wasn’t what I was hoping for. For a self tanner that’s cheaper than most and works better than most overall, I’d say give it a try and see how it works for you. I always keep an open mind with things like this and I definitely encourage anyone who buys this to do so as well. As with all self tanners, it’s not always perfect.",positive

So far I have to say I am SUPER impressed with this product. I’ll update it in the morning if things change but so far I am loving it! Possibly even more than a natural tan.

Here were my steps:
Showered and scrubbed with soap. Exfoliated with a sugar/coconut oil mixture. Shaved legs. Scrubbed again with soap (just to get rid of any lingering coconut oil). Applied one coat with their mitt and back product. Waited ten minutes and applied another coat. Currently, I’ve waited about 1 hour. I plan on sleeping in the product with pants and a long sleeve T-shirt. It’s not as dark as I would like at the moment but I can definitely tell a difference and I don’t want to apply a third coat, given that this is my first time using it. I have to say, I haven’t noticed any streaking and NO orangeness. Just looks like I was kissed by the sun! Also, I applied lotion to my face, knees, ankles, feet, and face to prevent and super dark spots. I only applied one coat to my face and it was with whatever leftover product I had at the end. I applied two coats to my knees, ankles, feet, and elbows. The first time I applied the product I used it everywhere else first, and then I applied it to my knees, ankles, elbows, and face. Again, with leftover product on my mitt. So far, I think the only thing I would change is exfoliating/moisturizing the day before I applied the product but I love it!

I followed the directions, used a mitt, and was very happy with the results.

The application was super easy. The product comes out in a bubbly mouse. I used short pumps and paid attention to what I was doing, making sure to blend. There was no offensive smell during the application but I did notice my body had an slight ""earthy-musty"" scent the following couple of days. It was very faint and I knew it would fade. Not messy at all.
None of my clothes, towels, or bedsheets were stained during or after the process. I was very careful applying the mousse to my face and the color blended well with my foundation. I experienced no skin or eye irritation.
The one bottle I bought will last me, I'm guessing, at least 5 more similar applications. I did touch up a few days after the first try.

absorb the product as you put it on and cuts spreading time in half as I learned. Another good tip if you are as new as me, if you use a gel/cream hair remover make sure you do that before you apply.

I will update to 5 stars once I'm able to fully use this and can test the length of wear, if it fades in the shower, and if it dries my skin a lot. But, so far it's great!",positive

The smell is hardly noticeable at all even the first day. I put it on after I shower in the morning. Once it's completely dry then I put on my clothes. Usually 30 minutes.

180,Amazon Launchpad,TubShroom The Revolutionary Tub Drain Protector Hair,$12.95 - $22.00,5,"I have tried every hair catcher conceivable on the market. The rave reviews for Tubshroom had me thinking so there was nothing to lose except the costly plumber and everything to gain - hopefully a clear drain.
Pros: the tubshroom collected the hair as promised after regular shampooing and conditioning BUT the big test was after using my in-shower hair mask which is a heavy cream product applied after shampooing but before the final conditioning. During this time, after applying the cream product, I lather up/rinse off then apply my conditioner. I kept one eye on the drain to monitor the results. Tubshroom performed as expected. Everything went down the drain and no residue in the tub - by residue I mean product suds that caused a slippery surface in the tub.. My first two photos above show how the hair did, in fact, wrap around the tubshroom and not down the drain. The third photo shows the amount of hair tubshroom caught. I used my styling brush as a dark backdrop so you can see the hair.
Cons: Only 2 - #1 My drain is just a hair (pardon the pun) smaller than the tubshroom; hence the bottom of the gadget is slightly bent but still does the job 100%. #2- Because I was in the shower for an extensive amount of time during this 1x a month treatment, the water did back up but only an inch or 2; however, the minute I turned off the shower, the water drained immediately. That's my lori-stori for Tubshroom which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I planned to make a video but my cellphone has limitations so I hope my review and photos help Amazon customers with this 5-STAR decision. Thank you. Psst: This product also makes a great holiday Stocking Stuffer.",positive

The nice thing about this one is that unlike mesh strainers that you just put on top of your drain, the hair that gets tangled in this one is not visible. The other side of this is that you have to take the thing out to clean, but that's very easy to do. Also take into account this can plug the bath, so if you want to take a bath you'll have to remove it and put in a plug. We basically don't use that bath almost at all but if you do, that's something to consider.",positive
182,Amazon Launchpad,TubShroom The Revolutionary Tub Drain Protector Hair,$12.95 - $22.00,5,"Honestly, I didn't believe the reviews, and if I didn't experience it for myself, I still wouldn't be a believer. My tub has a metal piece that the plumber broke when trying to remove so it's stuck there, which means the TubShroom sticks above the surface of the tub a good inch. It's a soft silicone feel, so there's no issue with a part of it being above the tub surface, but I thought, there's no way this will be effective - boy, was I wrong. Not only does the TubShroom capture all of the hair, but the water drains like a dream, which it has never done with any other drain protector. It is so easy to remove the captured hair.

Long. Hair.
I have tried every single drain guard on the market, yet there I am, a bottle of Drano in one hand and my phone in the other on speed-dial for my plumber.
Until I tried this.
It only fits in one of our drains-the traditional one-not the ones that are like flat grates on the floor. More’s the pity.
Because this works. Really works. Better than anything else I’ve tried.
Once properly seated into the drain hole there is very little that can get through. And it sits up above the level of the tub floor so that not only does the water go through it easily, you can just pluck it out and toss whatever hair has wrapped around it.

I have had better drainage and not any standing water while showering (yuck!). The main issue I have is cleaning it. Hair is gross, wet slimy hair is even worse. I am not a fan of pulling the hair out. I wish there was a way to get the hair without touching it. Plus, a few strands get tangled in the shroom and you have to work to get them out.

This is up your alley - because let me tell you, when you do eventually remember that this little guy is down there and hasn't been checked in a while, you're gonna pluck him out of the drain and begin the process of unwinding what can only be described as drowned roadkill. Every bit of soap, shampoo, etc that goes down the train will become part of the growing beast of human hair and slime to the point where it's just unpleasant to clean.

It's not HARD to clean. No special tools or chemicals needs. It's just unpleasant to clean. Like, you need a strong stomach. Maybe I just live with really gross people and we're balding at a rate never before documented by science - but the absolute nightmares this thing produces are... Well... Hopefully you get my point.

The very fact that it's producing so many Tribbles as opposed to letting them inevitably colonize in the drain and require intervention from yet another disgruntled plumber, however, surely means the design is good and well worth the money.",positive
187,Amazon Launchpad,TubShroom The Revolutionary Tub Drain Protector Hair,$12.95 - $22.00,5,"I ordered the Tub Shroom after years of frustration at the bathtub drain.

My wife has long hair. I have hair. It's not as long, but it contributes to the gross, never-ending cycle.

Because we are on septic, I'm absolutely not using the usual products on the drain. You know, the ones that eat clogs. The ones that I worry might screw up the septic somewhere between the tub drain and the actual tank. That would be really bad. It could cost thousands of dollars to repair or replace.

So, I get to either plunge the clog and hope it pushes out into the tank or snake the drain and hope I can forget the horrible mess.

The wet, slimy, soap scummy mess. The one that I must remove every several months. Because my wife and I both insist on having hair and showering.

So. Gross.

Anyway, I ordered the Shroom a couple few months ago and, after it arrived, performed what I hoped would be the last plunging and or snaking of the tub. After verifying that the tub drains perfectly, I removed the nearly useless drain cover - the metal circle with big holes that seem to attract hair - and popped in this product.

The Shroom let's plenty of water pass through. My wife and I both shower without any change in the experience.

Whrn I want to soak in the tub, I pop out the Shroom and use the flat stopper that just sort of splats over the drain. (It's an older house. The built in stopper stopped stopping drainage and I'm not tearing out drywall and spending my entire weekend messing with it.)

About once a week, I pull out the Shroom and use a bit of toilet paper to wipe it down. The mess of hair comes right off and I can toss the TP. All done. No snaking or plunging or horror.

This is a fantastic purchase and I would definitely buy again. The Tub Shroom has saved me from the wet, slimy masses of hair and God knows what else that I had been fighting for years.

Also, I threw away the metal drain cover because I didn't want to clean it. If I remove the Shroom, I guess I'll have to cough up a few bucks for a replacement cover, but at least it will be a clean, hair-free one.",positive

I have long hair and we also bathe our dogs in the bathtub. This seems to catch a lot of the hair. The only downside we have found is that it is easier to clean when it it dry, but usually you only notice that it needs to be cleaned once your tub isn't draining properly anymore. Obviously, when that happens it is now wet. So remembering to check it before each shower, just in case, is a bit of a hassle (really, it only needs to be cleaned about once per week). Overall we still prefer this to using drain cleaner chemicals when the drain gets clogged.",positive

I haven’t clogged my shower for 3 months now with this hair catcher in. Now I only insert it when I wash my hair , if you allow the hair catcher to accumulate too much hair you’ll begin to see it hold water thus YOU HAVE TO CLEAN IT BEFORE YOU SHOWER and then insert back in. Don’t allow it to sit there for various showers and have it collect hair , soap scum etc. I use gloves to clean it because it looks pretty nasty since it also collects some soap scum.
It fit the diameter of my shower drain unfortunately I don’t know the dimension of what I have.

Good: manipulating it until shapes *click* into place is very satisfying.
Bad: many of the obvious shapes I have made where all sides are touching flat do not magnetically stick together. Some of the coolest shapes don't stay, so they're either unintentionally cool shapes or the magnetic system has a huge design flaw.

Good: the designs are cool. The paper is thick.
Bad: I'm starting to see some white lines develop where the paper gets the most amount of pressure. Also, it takes a little more than minimal effort to pull this apart from the original cube form, so one set of corners is wearing.

I think that $25 is an absurd price to pay for this! ABSURD! I only bought it because I had gift card money.

I’ll buy them again because I do think they’re helpful. I got the pill version, because I didn’t trust gummy delivery in the summer time, and they have a bit of a funky taste but nothing unbearable.",positive

It sticks after the first FEW times you use it.
You’re supposed to spray 4X to dose & every time you push down to spray, IT STICKS, and you have to manually grab it & pull it up, EACH TIME YOU SPRAY….& it becomes harder & harder to push it down each time, too, not just to pull it up. And pulling it up once it’s stuck is not easy either. I’ve had to use my teeth a few times & a couple of those times, it didn’t work, had to get a gripper thing.☹️ But I like the product, just not the sprayer/“doser.”
Update: Beekeepers contacted me thru Amazon & refunded me my purchase amount thru Amazon. That speaks very highly of them, especially since I made no such request & they made good on their own. But NOW, Beekeepers, can the sprayer problem be fixed? Cuz I really wanna keep using the product but it is a pain pulling it up every time cuz it sticks, & it gets more difficult to push down each time, too, cuz it sticks.

I nicknamed my 5-yr-old cat Pica because she habitually chews on non-food items like she's still teething; nothing wrong in her blood work. I can't buy her toys wrapped with twine or string or even those toys made of large felt strips tied to sticks, because she'll unravel them and swallow the strings and felt strips whole like one long spaghetti. I bought her baby teething toys when she was 1-yr-old and she chewed them to pieces (dangerous!).

These tendon strips are perfect for her, especially since it's a food item! At first, she didn't take to them. Since they don't have a scent, I used one to pet her face around her mouth, which prompted her to lick it and bite at it. Less then a minute of playing like this and she was hooked on biting and chewing on it herself. The tendon stick is about 8 inches long and very tough, so she can grip it with her paws but her little teeth haven't been able to bite any of it off yet; one stick will definitely last a long time (i.e., well worth the money). I'm not worried about her swallowing a large piece since she tends to bite more towards the end of the stick when she holds onto it herself.

All up until this chew.

250,Amazon Launchpad,"TrailBuddy Trekking Poles - Lightweight, Collapsible Hiking Poles for Backpacking Gear - Pair of 2 Walking Sticks for Hiking, 7075 Aluminum with Cork Grip",$26.99 - $31.99,5,"Okay so not much different then the 4000 reviews for these poles. What has been said has probably been said somewhere.

So the poles first. We have the updated design with the threaded rubber feet instead of the push on version. Very nice to have that feature.

The poles come apart easily and back together while unlocked. With these poles to give it just that quick test. I set them leaned in with 6 feet 240lbs and these did not move at all. Which is great because I bought them for the wife who is accident prone.

The color the wife loves (berry pink). The accessories has things that my poles do not. First is the bag. That is great just to keep all the accessories and poles together.

The different tips, which we may get some use out of the mud ones but so far just normal rubber tips are good for the wife. Easy to adjust poles do come in handy for moving snakes off the paths.

And the cork handles I love more then mine. Plus Boomer on the logo is not a bad touch.

Not to mention a 3 year warranty for parts at the time of this review.

So if mine happen to get destroyed, lost, or dropped off lovers leap then these are going to be the replacements.

And the thing that is not an accessory is the clips that kept the poles together in the packaging. I liked those so much I came back here to see if I could get another set just those of those. You see I wanted to strap my poles more out of the way in the SUV while making them easy to get to. Those little clips are perfect for linking the poles together and strapping to the ceiling or side. And they just pop right off the poles when you need them.

So how did we get here. This is our forth round of poles. Our first round are just carved walking sticks that we have just for show of the trails we have been on. Not much use for actual hiking.

Then during one of our walks we ran into this older couple that was just tearing up the trail with hiking poles, while I am helping my wife over every stick and rock. So that is it, we are getting some poles.

So mine are cheaper (not by much) with no accessories, no bag, foam handle but has the flip locks. And I love them, but had I done more research I would have bought trailbuddy instead.

The wife then got our third set of poles. Research was done for purple poles. Seemed ok, so why not. This was a mistake. Those poles were those twist kind. You may have tried them...the kind that if you need to brace yourself slip back down to the smallest size while you continue your tumble. And that when you go to put them in your pack they lock in place that vice grips are going to be used to get them packed away. And then finally after dealing with all of that. The wife hands me a pole in two pieces and says it came apart. No problem, I can just slip the two pieces back to...geth...er....wait... I think I have it, well isn't that something. I am going to estimate of 30 minutes by the car trying to put two poles together. I am normally Mr. Fix it but man these poles humbled me. (I can not put to sticks together can you believe it). And when I did finally get it together it would not shrink so locked in a place too tall for the wife.

So I gave her mine to try and walked with her one pole that semi worked. With a vow that she is getting new poles and they will not be twist locks. So then she took a trip to see her sister in Arizona in which they walked all over the place. But good luck getting those twist locks in a suitcase. And I really did not want to part with mine, but they are going to stick out of her pack on a plane.

So she showed me these and finally I said sure....looks ok. But this time it was more then ok. They come apart easy and back together and are just as tight locking, but easy to adjust.

Worth every penny and we are now back to hiking again in north Georgia and Tennessee.
I cannot wait to try to get these past TSA when we go to key west to visit the other sister.

Final note - give Boomer a treat and a walk. He deserves it.",positive

Heck, Cathy and I hiked the 800 ft high, 3.6 mile Elephant Back Mountain trail in Yellowstone, and about 100 other places with sticks we found on the trail!!!...What do we know, we're a tad older, so we just figured that was the way it was done, until we started seeing other hikers with poles that looked to us like skiing poles. So, with the amount of hiking we do, I figured it might be time to upgrade from wood to something a bit more aerodynamic...That, and Cathy's birthday was coming up so it seemed like a cool gift. It's a bit overwhelming for a first time buyer. Questions I didn't even know to ask were answered from just about every outfitter on Amazon. Prices range from $120.00 to $20.00 So which ones are best? Carbon Fiber or Aluminum? Foam grips or cork? To lock them into place, do I get this kind of screw type latch, or that kind of flip and snap type latch? What are all the different types of attachment tips that come WITH some and not others? Oh, and last but not least (when it comes to Cathy)...What colors do they come in? After reading more reviews than War And Peace, I started narrowing down all of the factors and I focused in on 3 different brands in the 35 to 40 dollar range. I wasn't ABOUT to spend 120 bucks on something I had never used, but I didn't want to go cheapy cheap either. One seller, in their pictured ad on the page, while explaining how their locking system works, said to ""turn the knob"" this way or that...Only, they had spelled TURN...TRUN and KNOB...KNOP...Trun the knop counterclockwise....??? Heck, if they can't spell TURN and KNOB IN THEIR OWN AD on the Amazon site, then what chance do I stand using their product to help propel my big a$$ up and down a 1000 ft mountain??? So they were out. That left two, but something about the Trailbuddy poles kept me coming back to their site no matter how many I researched. I pulled the trigger on them, a blue set for me, and red set...excuse me, a BEETLE RED set for Cathy, and after logging several trail miles with them, we could not be happier. No wonder my arms were so tired after hiking for miles with a 5lb wooden stick! Only drawback is that I don't think I'd have the same luck beating back any bear I came face to face with, with an aluminum pole in my hand! But are they strong enough to support my 6'3"" 200 lb frame up and down hills, over muddy and rocky surfaces, and are they enough to prevent slips and potential falls? YOU BET! ...And THEN some! Cathy's pretty ecstatic about them too...Just between you and me, I don't think she ever liked the wooden sticks too much. Something about her hands getting too rough and needing extra moisturizer afterward. We love this product and I would definitely buy again, with one tiny caveat. The Orange-ish color shown as an option in the ad was not available as a choice when I clicked on them to choose my color and buy them. I figured orange would be a good color to spot in the woods if I ever laid them down to take a picture of Cathy conquering some mountain again. Well, that and Orange is the same color as the Houston Astros! Either they were discontinued, or they are just that popular! No matter. Blue works for me, and that's an Astros color too!!!...The few reviews that mention losing the rubber tips had me a bit concerned, but Cathy and I have already put these things through living hell and never had that problem. Perhaps they upgraded their design. If you're looking, and stuck in the minutia of trekking pole hell, stop here and press buy. You won't be disappointed.",positive
252,Amazon Launchpad,"TrailBuddy Trekking Poles - Lightweight, Collapsible Hiking Poles for Backpacking Gear - Pair of 2 Walking Sticks for Hiking, 7075 Aluminum with Cork Grip",$26.99 - $31.99,5,"I bought these hiking poles in early 2018 to use for stability while walking or hiking so I don't have to use a cane or crutches. I have been using them a few times a week for more than a year now, and I really like them.
I am a 49 year old man who was disabled and forced into medical retirement at 34 years old following a parachuting accident in the Army. I have complex injuries at multiple levels throughout my spine and hips, and I've had 3 spinal fusion surgeries over the past 16 years. Chronic pain and muscle spasms are a constant part of my life, as are instability, sudden weakness, and endurance issues. Those all are obstacles I did not have to manage in my youth. I grew up as a 4-sport athlete and manual laborer who went everywhere on a bicycle. After high school, I was both a full-time Army soldier (Infantry and Field Artillery) and part-time college student raising a family and enjoying an active lifestyle heavy on fitness, sports, fun and excitement. After sustaining widespread injuries to such critical structural parts of my body, I have been struggling in what feels like a totally different life in a different body trying to adjust to the countless changes. For years, the damage to my spine and hips was getting worse, so I kept having to reduce my activities until I was about 80% chair/bedridden in severe pain and misery - and depression. After several surgeries and years of ongoing therapies, trying and adjusting medications, and learning what I can and cannot do (still learning 20 years after the accident), I finally found decent medical care and figured out things I can do to enjoy life again and manage my disabilities, pain levels, and muscle spasms and cramps. After years of atrophying and gaining weight despite reducing calories and eating healthy, I have been able to put together a therapeutic fitness routine to rebuild some physical capabilities and improve my mobility, strength, and endurance while also getting out and about more. That includes walking and some hiking on established trails. I'm not talking about 25-mile ruck marches with combat training exercises mixed in, and I'm not talking about climbing mountains or hiking all day off the beaten path like I wish I still could do. I walk routes of 1.5- to 3.0 miles around my home in a hilly area, almost entirely on asphalt roads or trails and concrete sidewalks. In public parks, the established hiking trails vary greatly in distance and usually are packed gravel, packed dirt, asphalt, grassy paths, or a combination of surfaces. In Ohio's Hocking Hills and Mill Creek Park, there are steps cut into the landscape made of stone, gravel, wood, packed dirt, and grass. Again, it's not climbing mountains, but it can include uneven terrain, steps of different height and depth, and some places can be slippery. For someone who has struggled with falling and fighting through pain and spasms to get out of bed or a chair, being able to walk outdoors and enjoy the scenery and fresh air again is thrilling!
The TrailBuddy Trekking Poles give me the added confidence and stability support I need to be able to continue being active and working on my fitness. They look sporty and athletic, so I don't have to feel embarrassed using a cane or crutches -- and that can be a huge psychological factor for some people. I'm grateful to have my canes, crutches, and even an electric handicapped scooter when I need those devices, and I DO still need them all at times. When I want to feel a bit more like the athletic, physically fit, strong, active person I was the first 30 years of my life, grabbing my trekking poles to go for a walk or going to a park to hike in nature is a big deal, especially leaving the scooter at home and leaving the cane/crutches in the car.
When I'm feeling really good, I can collapse the poles and store them inside their bag (in which I also keep spare tips and tips for different types of terrain), and I slip the bag into my light backpack or strap it across my back. The poles are lightweight. They're easy to adjust, and the licking mechanisms never have failed me or even slipped a little bit. I'm 6'0"" tall and my weight has gone from 245-230 pounds. When I need to, I lean onto the poles for support, and they have always supported my weight without a problem.
They're a great buy at a good price.
I have never owned another pair of hiking poles, so I cannot compare with other brands, mechanisms, or materials. I used other people's poles a few times before buying my own, and I've checked out poles in sporting goods stores. I use tripods for my camera, binoculars and telescopes, so I've used collapsible devices with different kinds of locking mechanisms. I generally do not like adjustable/collapsible locking mechanisms that screw to tighten or loosen. The hinged flip-tabs on these poles actually have surprised me with how sturdy and reliable they are. They're adjustable, too, so you can tighten the locking tabs more or less depending on your preference.
My wife, kids and grandkids have all used my poles, so they've been adjusted to different heights many times. The poles have markings on them to use as guides when adjusting. I know which markings I use for my comfort, and I can tell at a simple glance if the poles have been adjusted or not. I always check the locking mechanisms at the same time, and then I'm off!
There can be some chafing on my hands around the wrist straps, but I prefer mine to be slightly snug. If I'm hiking, I keep gloves with me, and wearing gloves can reduce the chafing.
All-in-all, I'm very happy with these walking poles for how I use them, and I recommend them to anyone who wants some mobility stability and support but doesn't need to worry about whether or not they're tough enough to make it to the top of Mount Everest. They might he good enough, but I'd probably take a backup set or two if I were going to do more strenuous and more rugged hiking and climbing. I also would seek advice from experienced climbers regarding the best equipment to use on rougher terrain.",positive

The clamps are pretty odd in that the screw has to still be loose, but the instructions make this fact very clear. Speaking of, the manual included was in actual English, which was a nice surprise. The poles are lightweight and sturdy and have held up on various terrain so far. I prefer using the metal tips (which are pointed but not sharp) since I mostly walk on dirt, stone, gravel, or grass. I feel like I get a pretty good grip with the cork handle and find them comfortable. My only real complaint is that the hand straps are a little difficult to adjust, but so far they have held up fine.

I should note that after setting up the poles I keep them at a comfortable height and do not adjust them; I don't know if shortening the poles would affect their durability or not. I just stick the ends of the poles in the included bag (for mud) and leave them in the back of my car.

I used them on a hike near the house then carried them in a couple short trail runs so I could get used to their weight (which is very reasonable) hanging off my pack. I then took them on a trip into the mountains and their usefulness really became critical. They were particularly handy crossing streams especially when I had my family with me and wound up sheparding the group across and could use one to stabilize myself in the middle and pass the other to each person as they crossed. I'm sure there are nicer poles out there but these solved my problem for a very reasonable price and should be able to provide years of service. The cam locks really need to be tightened down out of the box. I'm not a little guy and the locks popped open under a solid lean test. Just open them and tighten the screws as hard as you can by hand, this will make the locks much harder to close due to the increase tension but I could lean my whole body weight onto one pole after this adjustment. The grips did wear on my hands after hours of heavy use, probably unavoidable really, but I had a pair of leather gloves in the pack for just such an issue.

If these trail buddy hiking poles disappoint in anyway, I will revise my review. I don’t think they will. They are very light, yet very sturdy. They have a telescoping design and a handy carrying case that can fit in my small day hiking backpack without needing to completely dismantle them, (they do stick out of the top of the pack but In a comfortable way), so they can be easily stored and carried when not needed. That is key for me, as I prefer not using trekking poles on mellow segments of trail, but love whipping them out on hairier segments. I have minor balance issues due to an inner ear thing, and even if I didn’t, these would be so helpful! Especially on steep declines! There are several ‘feet’ you can change out on the poles, depending on the terrain, which may end up being useful. I haven’t had that option in the past.

I’m very impressed with the quality of these poles. They are a good weight, the grip and strap are very comfortable. The locking mechanism is straightforward. Previous poles had more complex systems and they always ended up being the failure point. The carrying case is a great add to keep them together with all the accessories in the car or closet. And to keep things clean in checked luggage. I appreciate the spare set of end caps. I always lose end caps, but these screw on, so maybe I won’t lose them! The mod and snow baskets also screw on. I was hiking in snow recently with borrowed poles and the baskets kept falling off. And I kept find lost baskets on the trail. That won’t happen with these screw on ones!

I just couldn't figure it out, and I still had issues into adulthood. I bought the expensive left-handed can opener and it honestly wasn't that strong, so there went my money and my hope. And let me be clear, I can make pies and cakes from scratch, but opening a can just never went well for me. My grandma is 90, and we got her this so that her arthritis wouldn't act up so much when she cooked. She hated it because she said that it was too big compared to her can opener and it didn't cut the cans off the way her old one did. She's picky, so whatever. I tried it out and loved it. First off, the color is great. I love that I can attach it, press the button, and BAM! The end rises up a little (that's how you know you've got the right grip), and then I can mince garlic or add oil to the pan or season meat or literally anything else but agonize over opening a can. I usually let it go around twice, and it will stop itself once it has completely cut around the can. I press the button to turn it off, it sinks back down, and the top of the can magnetically sticks to the opener and pops right off! Sometimes the bigger cans require me to use the built in indentation to pry them up. Either way, cooking with canned food is now just as easy!

She cannot operate a manual can opener and she doesn't have the strength to hold a can for using a traditional electric can opener.

I purchased the Kitchen Mama in hopes she would be able to use it. A few days after I showed her how to operate the opener, she opened her first can with no problems at all. She was extremely excited with the ease of use and her success in opening a can on her own.

It's very easy to align the opener on the can and the opener works like a charm! I am as pleased with the Kitchen Mama as my wife is. I I kept the manual can opener as a backup, but don't expect to have the need to use it.

After reading a number of reviews complaining about the unit quitting after just a few weeks or months, I realized that some users may be missing a few important issues. 1 - A motorized device, such as a can opener, requires more battery power than something like a flashlight, wireless door bell, etc. If your can opener is bogging down, test and or replace the batteries. They need to be well into the good range. 2 - Generic batteries usually do not have the power or life as the brand names. I use nothing but Duracell.

If you wonder about this advice, I started tinkering with electricity and electronics when I was about 7 (64 years ago). I have a degree in electronics and a diploma in appliance repair.

270,Amazon Launchpad,"Stasher Silicone Reusable Storage Bag, Bundle 4-Pack Large",$9.21 - $101.99,5,"I felt compelled to write a review after reading some of the negative ones left. I just purchased ANOTHER set, a year later, because we love these so much! With 3 kids, these have saved us (and the planet) hundreds of plastic ziploc bags over the past year! That’s not to say we completely stopped using one-use bags, but these eliminated the daily use of those, for sure!
We started with the Large set to try. Quickly added a bunch of sandwich sized to the collection. And then some 1/2 gallons. Waiting for some deals for more of the stand-up types, as I get braver to try liquids.
Daily use, the kids take breakfasts on-the-go almost daily. They have left stuff in them, to be “found” in the car, days later. Never an issue with smell or cleaning!
I have a rough 6 y/o and 9 y/o, and haven’t had any rips or tears. They have held up over road trips, and daily abuse. I don’t use for red-sauce type foods though. Those always stain silicone.
I would say the issue of mold in the seals, I was worried about, so I always dry upside down, until they are very dry. Usually over a cup or a handle or a “branch” thing on the baby bottle rack. (See photo). Haven’t had an issue in a year. I suspect people with mold issues aren’t drying throughly. I keep them in a pantry organizer and the kids have easy access. As we’ve been minimizing, editing, in our house with very little storage, these are keepers!

They do not leak with the things that I put into them, which are dry. They seal tightly, and they are very easy to clean.

They are difficult to open for people with arthritis or any disability in their dominant hand. They get easier after use, but can still be tricky to open.

272,Amazon Launchpad,"Stasher Silicone Reusable Storage Bag, Bundle 4-Pack Large",$9.21 - $101.99,5,"I noticed a couple of other reviews talking about how they came in plastic bags. I noticed upon receiving my stasher bags that they came in all different types of packaging. Paper, plastic, or none at all. My advice, you can obviously recycle the paper, and the plastic wrap you can recycle at your local grocery store, but hopefully it's not a deal breaker, because with these bags you'll never have to use zip locks again! I've been using stasher for a while now and these are my first larger sized bags. I've noticed they're not very fun to clean by hand, but in the dishwasher they do great and you can wash them on either the top or bottom rack. They can also be microwaved or put in the oven which is super convenient for me. I used up my zip lock bags before I switched to these and now I no longer have to feel guilty every time I stick yet another ziplock into recycling where I'm not even sure they'll be turned into a new bag. They don't get damaged easily, or at least not that I've noticed, and all around they're a great product, in my opinion. Each order comes with one bag. They're a bit pricey, but worth the price if you use these a lot, but, like others, I suggest you wait for sales to buy or buy them locally. My whole foods sells them, for example. They do come dusty, so give them a wash when they arrive before you use them, and when you wash them make sure you dry them thoroughly so moisture doesn't get trapped in them.",positive
273,Amazon Launchpad,"Stasher Silicone Reusable Storage Bag, Bundle 4-Pack Large",$9.21 - $101.99,5,"Stasher silicone bags are a good quality expensive reusable option for food (and not only). The bags are very versatile, the limit being just the size; I use them to store, carry, freeze, refrigerate, warm-up, cook food and anything in between. The silicone is quite thick, but still somewhat flexible; the thick silicone makes them really durable, but I would still advise care to not scratch or puncture the surface with something very sharp.
The Stasher bags make a great addition to my plastic free reusable items collection of household items.

Overall, I wouldn't consider them that great for voluminous items, since the silicone is quite thick and the opening quite narrow. And if you pack too much stuff in them the pinch-lock can easily open; but if you don't over stuff the bags the seal is air-tight. Still, personally I won't store liquids like soup in them.

I personally wash them in the dishwasher and they always come out 100% clean. I just make sure that I `spread` out the opening as much as I can without putting stress on the silicone. I never noticed gunk hiding in the crevices of the pinch-lock or around the corners; and since mine are transparent, they would be easy to spot. If I leave them stretch-opened in the dishwasher, they dry out completely.
Depending what I stored in the bags, they do get some staining in time; but I consider this part of the regular wear and tear.
Otherwise, my bags were used hundreds of times in the freezer, microwave and oven, without any issues.

Snack size:
The snack size is pretty small, it's more usable for portioned snacks (puffs, nuts, crackers, dried fruit, homemade granola bars). It's quite sleek, so it fits in bags and backpacks, while keeping items safe. If you sit on the bag you'll crush the puffs/crackers, but otherwise they do help with keeping snacks from crumbling.
I used sometimes to freeze smaller portions of fruits or half of an avocado.
It's the perfect size to bring vitamins and supplements to a week long vacation/travel.

Sandwich size:
The sandwich size is the most versatile for me. I use it to store small portions of meats and veggies/fruits in the freezer. I use it for leftovers in the fridge. I use it to carry snacks, from rice cakes, to carrots, sugar snap peas, crackers, puffs. I use it for bread and sandwiches; the bag fits regular sized sandwich bread, but it's too large for thin sliced small portioned ones and not big enough for super-sized slices; if you make huge over-stuffed sandwiches, they won't fit in the bag.
Besides storing bread, the bag is great for reheating stale or frozen bread in the oven. I pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees, put the bread/buns locked in the bag for 7-8 minutes and get back crusty warm delicious bread. I bet it works for (non-glazed) donuts and pastries as well.
I also cooked eggs in the sandwich size bags, both in the microwave and in boiled water. The eggs are really fluffy when cooked in the Stasher bags.

Big size (1/2 gallon):
I mostly use the big size to freeze large quantities and sizes of veggies (great for long one like green beans and asparagus).
But the best use for the 1/2 gallon bag for me is making popcorn. I just put in the salt and the popcorn kernels, run my microwave popcorn program for 3-4 minutes, and get perfectly popped popcorn each time; you can add oil or butter if you like, but it's not mandatory. I would repurchase this bag again and again just to use it for popcorn. Mine started getting brown stains from all the times I made popcorn in it.
Another great use for the big size is steaming veggies in the microwave for a quick meal. It works for green beans and smaller broccoli and cauliflower florets.

Stand-Up:
This is definitely the most versatile bag, from pantry to freezer, from produce to soups. It can hold a large diversity of dry bulk goods, rice, beans, smaller pasta, crackers, nuts, cereal. Fruits and smaller (or cut) veggies fit perfectly both for fridge and freezer storage. They are great for meal prep, both for storing food and for taking it along (although the opening won't allow too much flexibility from eating straight from the bag). In the big one I can store even whole cut watermelons and halves of spaghetti squash.

I have purchased various sizes from Amazon both individual bags and sets, usually when there's a deal around. I have reviews for different sizes with the same overall comments, but specific considerations depending on the size.",positive
274,Amazon Launchpad,"Stasher Silicone Reusable Storage Bag, Bundle 4-Pack Large",$9.21 - $101.99,4,"As others have mentioned, these bags are extremely sturdy. In addition, the seal is super tight, so whatever you put inside will stay fresh.

Cleaning was a concern because we have a double-drawer Fisher Paykal that only has one level. But, thanks to answers for other Amazon users, I washed the largest one in our dishwasher, and it came out sparkling clean without watermarks.",positive
275,Amazon Launchpad,"Stasher Silicone Reusable Storage Bag, Bundle 4-Pack Large",$9.21 - $101.99,5," I absolutely LOVE stasher. I’ve been “collecting” them for about a year and a half now, and couldn’t be any happier with a silicone product. I try my hardest not to use single use products. My journey isn’t perfect, but stasher makes it 10 times easier. I have NEVER experienced ripping, tearing, exploding, molding, or spilling with any of the stasher bags that I’ve owned. DO NOT TURN THESE INSIDE OUT. That is definitely the very first rule for the longevity of this product. I put these in the oven, microwave, and sous vide with them. (Make sure to open the stasher slightly when putting them in the oven and microwave) These freeze wonderfully, and NOT prone to freezer burn. I don’t have plastic in my freezer, only stashers. The food truly does last longer. When I buy tons of ground meat, I will portion them out in my half gallon stasher- flatten the meat out-let all the air out of the stasher, seal it up, and freeze them flat. Can’t imagine my food prep without them. Perfect for low waste food shopping, and traveling as well. Now that I’ve gotten my pros out of the way, let’s talk cons. They stain extremely easy. Aesthetically, I don’t want sauce stained stashers. Tomato, turmeric etc. Not every sauce stains. But the dark acidic sauces do. Also, putting heavily scented items in the stasher will make the fridge smell. I quickly realize I can’t keep onions, scallions, and other smelly foods in the stasher as storage. If it does make my stasher smell, I can put them in the dishwasher and the smell will go away immediately. No big deal. Also if I put something like chips, pretzels, crackers ETC in my stasher longer than 24 hours, I feel as if the food becomes stale. Even with the air out of the Stasher and it being sealed tightly. It has always been like that for me. Other than that, stasher is one of the greatest low waste products that I have ever owned! I love all of my beautifully colored stashers!
