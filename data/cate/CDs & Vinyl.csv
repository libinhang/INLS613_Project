0,CDs & Vinyl,"Gskyer Telescope, 70mm Aperture 400mm AZ Mount Astronomical Refracting Telescope for Kids Beginners - Travel Telescope with Carry Bag, Phone Adapter and Wireless Remote",$9.99,5,"I bought this knowing nothing about telescopes and not knowing what I could expect to see through this thing.

Now I know more, I think this is a decent value, but it comes with A LOT of cons.

In telescopes, the aperture size matters much more than magnification. The bigger the aperture, the better the image will be. This is a 70mm aperture (2.75 inches), which is about as small as you can get. It's typical for an ""entry-level"" telescope, and a decent value for the money if you want to get into stargazing without dropping 500 bucks or more on a bigger scope.

However, if I could do it over again, I would've spent more and gone with a better one.

First, as with all beginner telescopes, it is actually much harder to use than a more intermediate level one. This is something well-known in the amateur astronomy group I've joined, and they never, EVER recommend buying a beginner telescope, ESPECIALLY for kids.

Because most kids like looking AT stuff more than looking FOR it. And with this telescope, far more time is spent hunting for objects than actually looking at them.

My kid doesn't have the patience or attention span for that, but I rather enjoy the challenge, so I do it. Which brings me to the next problem.

This is made for kids. As such, the stand is very short. Which means that all the time you spend hunting for things, you'll having to be hunched over, crouched down, or kneeling on the ground.

And if you live in a place with a lot of light pollution, you won't be able to see much more than stars, the Moon, or the brightest planets. Even Mars is difficult to see through this telescope, and you can't make out any detail whatsoever on the surface.

You can make out SOME faint detail on Jupiter, especially if you go away from light pollution on a clear, moonless night. And you can just make out Saturn's rings.

Venus, on the other hand, is very easy to see. Especially now, near the end of April 2020, it is the brightest it'll be all year, so we've been looking at it every night. It's too bright, even at its dimmest, to make out any detail, but you can see what phase it's in.

Galaxies, most nebulas, and many star clusters are beyond the ability of this telescope, but that being said, I was able to see a planetary nebula called The Ghost of Jupiter last night.

For perspective, I've had a few weeks of use and practice, and feel comfortable with the telescope, and have a number of apps, charts, and star maps to help me find things, and it STILL took over an hour for me to finally find it, put it close enough to the center of my field of view to use with max magnification, and put it in focus.

And even then, it looked like a hazy, bluish star. We couldn't make out any detail or the distinctive eye-shape that can be seen with even slightly larger scopes.

Still, it was cool and the kid loved it. I consider it worth the effort, but my back is killing me today.

Don't get me wrong, for an entry-level telescope, this is good. It'll serve our needs while we save up for an upgrade. But, like all entry-level telescopes, this is harder to use and not powerful enough to see much.

All the time required to hunt for things, for what many may consider a disappointing result, could potentially end up killing a kid's enthusiasm.

If you absolutely MUST get an entry-level telescope, this is a good choice. But if at all possible, save up and get a larger aperture.",positive

It's been perfect for supermoon season. Not really good for other planetary bodies, but definitely was useful when I was trying to figure out what was happening a few miles away under a plume of smoke. If you like to check out the details of the moon, this is a great purchase.",positive

3,CDs & Vinyl,"Gskyer Telescope, 70mm Aperture 400mm AZ Mount Astronomical Refracting Telescope for Kids Beginners - Travel Telescope with Carry Bag, Phone Adapter and Wireless Remote",$9.99,4,"This really is a great telescope but with my iPhone 13 it definitely does not help during the daytime hours when trying to take pictures of birds or whatever it may be. It is constantly readjusting focus and seems to never get that, I have only been out at night a few times with the camera and it works well but there is quite a lot of adjusting necessary to get a good picture. Beside the fact of trying to take photos with a mobile phone it is a great telescope and works as you would expect it. This is honestly a good investment if you are wanting to get into night time viewing or daytime without taking pictures.",positive

She is really into astronomy and constellations, stars, etc. I wanted a 'starter' telescope, but most of the models seemed like they were for little kids. This one, however, completely matched all of my expectations. It has different lenses, an easy tripod mount, and a digital display!! Great for starry nights.",positive

7,CDs & Vinyl,"Gskyer Telescope, 70mm Aperture 400mm AZ Mount Astronomical Refracting Telescope for Kids Beginners - Travel Telescope with Carry Bag, Phone Adapter and Wireless Remote",$9.99,4,"I bought this as a gift for my grandkids and the intent was to allow them to witness the ""Christmas Star"", the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn on December 21. The plan was to capture the event nightly from December 19 through December 22.

Receiving and unboxing the telescope was pretty straightforward. The instructions were somewhat trying, but given that there were only a few ""moving parts"" it was easy enough to figure out. The only problem we encountered was that the adapter for allowing the telescope to connect to a smartphone was missing half of the adapter and we could not connect a phone to the telescope. No idea why the part was missing. We unboxed the telescope on our dining room table and when we discovered the part was missing we had no less than 5 adults searching for it, to no avail. We didn't lose the part, we just never had it. That was disappointing when you consider that being able to attach a phone was one of the primary reasons for selecting Gysker and we lost our opportunity for the grandkids to record their witness of the grand event.

Setting that bit aside, the telescope worked wonderfully. It was easy to set up, with all of the [available] parts fitting nicely into the supplied carrying case. We transported the telescope to our observation area and the telescope set up easily. The 'spotter' scope allowed us to get on target quickly and the aperture and zoom features allowed for a spectacular view, including many of the moons surrounding the planets. We even used the spotting scope and a smartphone app to align the telescope with other stars for equally breathtaking views and we spent about 2.5 hours searching out various objects in the night sky each time we went out. (From dark until bedtime).

The grandkids (10, 9 and 7) really took to the telescope, learning how to use the various parts and functions rather quickly, even to the point that they could select and observe a star on their own. The tripod was solid and held a stable image and everything, sans phone adapter, worked very well.

If I was rating just the telescope on cost to function-ability, I would rate the Gysker telescope 10 stars. It is a very good telescope for the money and since we wanted the kids to get excited about the night sky, this was a great purchase. The ONLY disappointment was because I specifically chose this telescope because we could attach a smartphone to record an event that only happens every 800 years and then was unable to do exactly that, well, it was a real letdown.

Even at that, I would tell anyone wanting to start amateur exploration of the sky that this is still a great telescope for the money.",positive

It was easy to carry on to the mountain. Easy to set up and take down. Put in the camera attachment on was a bit tough but finally got these pictures. It's definitely harder to see stars with this cause it's not as powerful and it doesn't have the timer to follow the Earth's movement, but just for checking out The moon and planets it works really good",positive
10,CDs & Vinyl,Will of The People,$12.79,4,"I've been hoping Muse would have another album that would rival their second, third and fourth albums. That's a tall order, and Will of the People doesn't reach that level, which is why it doesn't get a fifth star. HOWEVER, it is significantly better than their last three albums, and possibly better than their last four albums. If you're doing the math, that possibly makes it their best album since Black Holes and Revelations. It's certainly their best since The Resistance. For those who were waiting for Muse to get their mojo back, here it is. Welcome back, Muse!!!",positive
11,CDs & Vinyl,Will of The People,$12.79,3,"Unfortunately due to the ""life during covid"" subject matter, pretty much every song on the album is going to date quickly. Had this been released in august 2020 instead, it would of been absolutely appropriate for that summer. But sorry Matt Bellamy, you're two years too late. The last thing anyone wants to do is listen to bands weeping about the state of the world now. We want escapism from all that. With that all said, this is certainly not a bad album though. This is Muse doing Muse things after all, which is still better than 98% of what's out there. As usual they nail the Queen sound, on the track Liberation. That is probably the track that will get the most plays by me.",fair
12,CDs & Vinyl,Will of The People,$12.79,5,I thought this was going to be an ok album wont stand down was in my top 10 when i first heard it so i thought it would be at least 4 good songs i could listen to but im happy to say i was wrong this cd will be the only cd allowed in my car for at least 2 months straight.,positive
13,CDs & Vinyl,Harry’s House,$31.49,4,"My 10 year old and I LOVE Harry Styles and have all of his albums. Fine Line is still my favorite album of his, but this is an awesome album too - it has a lot of funky 70s beats as well as a Phil Spector wall of sound feel to some of the songs. Harry's voice is excellent, great for slow and fast songs. ""As It Was"" is my favorite, but I also love ""Music for a Sushi Restaurant,"" ""Late Night Talking,"" ""Love of My Life,"" and ""Keep Driving."" The only song that I don't like is ""Boyfriends."" If you're a Harry fan, you'll love it. Even my mom who had no idea who he was liked a lot of the songs when we listened to it as we drove to the beach- she said they had a 70s feel. Harry has really come into his own and you can tell he loves the music he makes now as a solo artist.

My only complaint is the terrible cardboard packaging, it arrived a little bent on one corner. The hard clear cases are so much better because it actually protects the inserts and CD. It's also awkward to take out because the opening has you pulling it out from the center. Redo the packaging please.",positive

A multiple number of other songs. A music listener can easily be metaphorically transported into a music treasure chest of other earthly and pleasant emotions listening to a multiple number of other hypnotizing songs on Harrys House; Daylight, Late Night Talking, Cinema, Love Of My Life, and more.",positive

CDs cost less, too.",positive
20,CDs & Vinyl,Harry’s House,$31.49,5,I thought every single song were written and performed beautifully. It's not an album that has only 3 to 5 good songs.

23,CDs & Vinyl,Finally Enough Love: 50 Number Ones,$26.39,5,"As someone still mourning the demise of the CD single, compilations such as this can come as a real treat. And as a huge fan of Madonna in particular – with the tattoo to prove it – the gaps in my collection of physical media is especially heart wrenching as we’ve moved into the digital age. Though a lot of the material on Finally Enough Love isn’t completely new to me, I can still appreciate older songs in edited and/or remastered form (“Everybody,” “Physical Attraction,” “Like a Prayer,” to name a few), and anything past about the MDNA era which was never issued on CD maxi-single at all (such as “Turn Up the Radio,” “Ghost Town,” “Medellin”) definitely makes it worth the purchase, at least to me.

At this point the only thing left is the subjective argument of whether they selected the best remixes available for this collection. Personally, I would have swapped out the so-so Thunderpuss mix of “Don’t Tell Me” for the more exciting Vission mix, for example, or perhaps included a less dubby version of “What It Feels Like For a Girl,” but we could go back and forth like that all day. In the end nothing that made the final cut is bad enough to warrant knocking off any points from what is otherwise a 5-star effort. Nor would I lose sleep over what some might call technical issues; nobody cares if a song fades two and a half seconds earlier on this CD than it did on its original 1984 release :P

All in all, hardcore fans, though often nitpickly, should ultimately just be satisfied this album exists at all, while more casual buyers will be pleased to discover all new aspects to their favorite Madonna hits they probably never knew existed before. Here’s to fifty more, I say!",positive
24,CDs & Vinyl,Finally Enough Love: 50 Number Ones,$26.39,5,"Madonna's 3 disc remix album is beyond indescribable! This really takes long time fans back to certain songs that are part of our teenage years to our young adult lives to nearly 50 and older in what marks her 40 years in music. For me the best part is the remastering of the older songs. Express Yourself Open Your Heart (the never before released video version) and Vogue sound amazing! These songs were really in need of an upgrade and this is top quality. My favorite surprise is the remix for Turn Up The Radio, which I had never heard. This release has a bunch of brand new never before released remixes that are incredible. Keep It Together Impressive Instant and Living For Love are standouts. Add these to your gym workouts, you will feel the energy! This really is a treasure trove for fans and the not so big fan would love this as well. I do have 3 small issues with this release. Causing A Commotion, a number 1 from 1987 was not included on this release, I believe because there was a single vinyl release on its own, still , would have been great to have it here! 2nd, the remix of Like A Prayer here is not the popular dance version the radio always played, Madonna for whatever reason added a different version that I really don't care for. 3rd, the remix of Fever should have been the video remix. The one on this release is a little underwhelming. Nevertheless, this is an epic collection that is long overdue that Madonna produced herself. Finally Enough Love, finally!!!",positive
25,CDs & Vinyl,Finally Enough Love: 50 Number Ones,$26.39,5,"Writing this review while listening to this collection, cannot help but think about how incredible it must be for longtime fans to realise that they have been following the woman who changed the face of pop music for the most part of their lives.

64 years old this week, the one and only and most celebrated pop icon is also celebrating 40 years in the business with this, a 50-track collection of remixes, all of which charted at the top of the Billboard Dance Chart. Primarily aimed at fans, ""FEL"" is the first in the series of reissues following Madonna's return to Warner.

This is the most complete out of the 7 CD and vinyl variations. It is a cute 8-panel digipack, with a frugal 12-page booklet giving some background info about each remix, no photos. The music itself is the most important aspect of the release obviously: even the avid Dan will at some point marvel at the grandeur of the material selected here, some of which is quite simply astonishing (""Everybody"", ""Like a prayer"", ""Express yoursel"", ""Bedtime story"", ""What it feels like for a girl"", ""Sorry"", ""Celebration"").

It becomes more impressive when someone realises that some of her biggest hits ever are not included on here simply because they did not chart at the top spot of the Dance Chart (no ""Live to tell"", ""Papa don't breach"", ""La isla bonita""). But it's pretty wild to know that there is an artist who has never stopped offering material and surprising fans and critics alike with the diversity and inspiration that is exhibited in these remixes. This is a must-have to any music fan's collection.",positive
26,CDs & Vinyl,Finally Enough Love: 50 Number Ones,$26.39,5,"I loved this set. The artwork, the liner notes and the music. All of these mixes are pretty great. I particularly loved her remixes in the 90's, the Junior Vasquez ones, the William Orbit ones. I don't mind that most are shortened. If she had released the full length versions, it would have been a 4 or 5 disc set which would have cost more to produce and probably wouldn't have sold as much. No big deal. I actually prefer the shorter versions. Can't please everyone. But I'm pleased. Great collection! Long live Madonna!",positive
27,CDs & Vinyl,Finally Enough Love: 50 Number Ones,$26.39,4,"Is this collection needed, yes. Is it necessary, not entirely.
Hardcore fans will appreciate the many formerly unavailable remixes (although most are edited for time restraints). Wayward fans might not find it entirely useful. Don't get me wrong, as a once hardcore fan, some of these I have been waiting to see a domestic release for years and they prove worth the wait.
One issue for me is which formerly available remixes the have chosen to include. A few completely kill the flow of the album.
All this said, the remastering is excellent and the packaging is great, especially the track by track descriptions in the liner notes.",positive

88,CDs & Vinyl,Thriller,$16.83,5,"There will never be another artist like Michael Jackson. He had everything. The sex appeal, the voice, the experience, the connections- Michael Jackson epitomized everything about a pop artist. Despite his recent history and the jokes that go hand in hand (which haven’t been funny for years), Michael Jackson proves on his albums that no matter what he does, he has something great that everyone will remember him for. Thriller stands out as one of the best albums in his career, showcasing some of his most legendary songs ever.

The success of Thriller is flat out scary. The album skyrocketed to the top of the charts and stayed there for 80 weeks, one of only 3 albums to reach that level. Today, it stands as the second highest selling album in the United States and according to some sources, the highest selling album ever in the world. Seven of the nine songs on Thriller became singles, and three of them are among Jackson’s greatest hits. Thriller shows Michael Jackson branching off into a large amount of genres, including rock, R&B, funk, and just straight up 80s synth pop. Despite all the different areas of music, Jackson almost subconsciously inputs his undeniable catchiness and appeal. He took a larger songwriting and production role on this album, allowing him to really play to his strengths. He shows an obvious influence from artists like James Brown, George Clinton, and Stevie Wonder, but he also pulls in some even bigger star power. He called on Paul McCartney, immortally famous Beatles member, to do a duet with him. They “collaborated” and produced The Girl is Mine, the first single off of Thriller

Jackson actually wrote all of The Girl is Mine, not allowing McCartney in any of the writing. McCartney simply adds his voice and more importantly, his name to the song. Unfortunately, even with the talents of two of the greatest pop artists of all time, The Girl is Mine fails to impress. The song is a slow, dreamy love song, allowing the vocal talent to stand out. However, the poppy hooks fail to catch the attention of the listener and the music itself pails in comparison to most of the album. Regardless, The Girl is Mine found instant success, maybe due to the star power in the song. It peaked at #2 in the pop singles chart. However, The Girl is Mine was only the beginning of the success for Thriller. Jackson then released Billie Jean, a much more uptempo and overall better song than his previous effort. Jackson also wrote Billie Jean entirely, and proves his undeniable songwriting talent on the song. It grooves a simple drum beat and a fantastic, jumpy bassline. Melodically, a synth chord progression outlines the verse, but more and more instruments add in to the climatic chorus. The chorus features extremely catchy vocal harmonies and a superb funky guitar line. That line later expands into an instrumental bridge, and the guitar stands out as a certain highlight of the song. Billie Jean shot to #1 in both the Black Singles and Pop Singles charts.

Thriller contains two more extremely important tracks, the first being the title track. Known more for its dance moves and music video, Thriller is about as epic as a pop song gets. The song draws from Tower of Power horn licks and Funkadelic pop sensibility. The huge brass statement that leads the song into its main groove simply states that Thriller plans to go beyond the normal limits of a pop song. The song outlines the story of a cheesy horror film, which the video conveys perfectly. Immediately following Thriller is Beat It, which also brings in some extreme extra star power. Jackson called on Eddie Van Halen to play guitar on this song. The song draws heavily from the hair metal wave taking the rock nation by storm. The song actually peaked at #14 on the rock charts as well as #1 once again on the Pop Singles and Black Singles charts. Van Halen’s guitar playing is just as lackluster as McCartney’s appearance, but at least Van Halen isn’t as legendary as McCartney. He bursts out his typical fret-burning solo that somehow never impresses me. However, it’s a common misconception that fast guitar playing equals good guitar playing, so fans ate the song up. The riffing plays fairly stereotypical, but this isn’t on a Van Halen album, it’s on a Michael Jackson album, and Jackson lets his audience know that. His poppy vocal harmonies and lyrics make this song for what it is.

Overall, Thriller is composed much like a sandwich. The bread covers the top and bottom, the less interesting part of the sandwich. On Thriller, tracks 1-3 make a good first impression but after hearing the entire album, they just do not live up to the middle of the album, or the meat of the album. The three huge singles, Thriller, Beat It, and Billie Jean all stand out even today as some of the greatest pop singles of all time. Finally, the last half of the album feels much like the beginning. Human Nature and The Lady in My Life are both good tracks, featuring some great bass and Jackson’s more sensitive side, but still never live up to the catchiness and fun of the middle of the album. However, as the entire album is listenable all the way through and each track has at least its moments, Thriller stands as one of Jackson’s greatest efforts, giving him an eternal legacy in pop music.",positive

124,CDs & Vinyl,RENAISSANCE,$10.79,5,"Club Renaissance is finally open and what a once in a lifetime moment Queen Bey has created with this lively vibrant body of Art. Even with a pesky album leak a couple days prior to it's release, the real Beyhive held it down and didn't sneak into the club too early despite the temptation to hear the magical sounds that make up Act I of this musical journey. RENAISSANCE (the first act in a sprawling genre swirling trilogy of albums) is dirty decadent ""Disco Trap"" (as Queen Bey coins her newest sound in the spirited and powerful groove ""Heated""). RENAISSANCE is fantasy (vogue worthy ""Alien Superstar""), RENAISSANCE is dreamy (honey sweet jazzy jam ""Plastic Off The Sofa""), sweaty (the Grace Jones and Tems assisted night out anthem ""Move""), sexy (hypnotic and funky album centerpiece ""Virgo's Groove"" which unfolds like three excellent songs in one) and luxurious self-affirming escapism in a time we need it most. Creatively curated during the pale bleakness of the pandemic, it makes sense why the album is energetically neon-drenched and dripping with glittering finery, RENAISSANCE is meant to be a hyper stylistic jolt of aspirational hope for enriching fun and living life fully present. The music is invigorating, enthralling (Beyoncé delivers such fresh vocal compositions here and sophisticated sonic structures around her voice, exercising it in ways she rarely does) and inspires unphased self-confidence and self-resilience. It feels like your ears and entire being are stepping into a modern-day ultra-chic Studio 54 of Beyoncé's wildest dreams and Club Renaissance is her answer to fill that void, where no hate or harmful shade will be tolerated. To fully appreciate this beautiful album, one must know the gorgeous history and legacy of Black Queer culture (specifically the late 70's to early 90's New York Ballroom scene and it's bawdy brazen House music), various textures of African music like Afrobeat, some Afropunk, Southern Hip-Hop/Bounce and Soul that inspires it. Beyoncé and her creative collaborators made it a point to shine a comprehensive light on the Black Queer creatives and allies that made it possible for this music to be created in the first place. This is why ""Break My Soul"" featuring sampled vocals from Big Freedia encouraging us to ""release the wiggle,"" and a sample of ""Show Me Love"" by Robin S. (a huge 90's House classic) being the first single near the end of Pride month sets such a strong tone. While the album is not political in an obvious way, much-needed messages of pride, self-love (sleek, snapping and sassy T.S. Madison vocal sampling ""Cozy""), unjudged and unrestricted bodily autonomy (the raucous and layered ""Church Girl""), aware sexual freedom (deliciously distorted and most experimental track ""All Up In Your Mind"") and liberation are at the core of the songs. These real-life inspirations are what birthed House music. RENAISSANCE act i much like House music is about liberation, joy, building community and sharpening that inner ferocity within to fight whatever or whoever may seek to oppress one's truth. From the first song to the last Bey gives us the soundtrack to elevate past the peril we battle. Personally, this album makes me feel very happy, many of the songs make me smile and scream with glee and I must say RENAISSANCE act i is a new all-time favorite for me. RENAISSANCE makes me feel alive and fired up to be even stronger and inspires a personal reinvigorated renaissance; one where I go for all the luxury in all it's meanings that I deserve that life offers.",positive
125,CDs & Vinyl,RENAISSANCE,$10.79,5,"I have to be honest, I didn't like 1990's r&b. Much of it was slick, soulless soul. There were a few artists that I liked in that genre, but Destiny's Child wasn't one of them. In fact, Beyonce's first two albums, ""Dangerously in Love"" and ""B'Day"" suffered from that kind of lousy production. It really wasn't until 2008's ""I Am....Sasha Fierce"" that she broke away from that garbage and began to forge her own style. That album was panned for some reason. Since then, Beyonce has done no wrong, releasing one strong work after the next. ""Renaissance"" is no different.

The whole album fits nicely together, just like 2013's ""Beyonce"" does. Sure, there's a few tracks here and there that are okay, but mostly, the songs work. This is her 'club' album. She's witty with attitude. I particularly liked ""I'm That Girl"" with the interesting juxtaposing of her on a megaphone in the background singing unintelligible lyrics slowed down and sped up while singing in her normal voice on top of it. It works brilliantly.

""Alien Superstar"" has this synth riff in its chorus that gives it an otherworldly feel.

Of course #1 single ""Break My Soul"" is aggressive and has a beat of Robin S.'s 1993 hit ""Show Me Love"" which works very well here.

""Move"" followed by ""Heated"" is a one-two punch of dance groove.

I really think Beyonce outdoes herself with ""All Up in Your Mind"", ""Pure/Honey"" and ""Summer Renaissance"". These songs show a new and fresh direction that Beyonce could take in the future. This stuff is bordering on Prince-like genius. I really appreciate her nod to Donna Summer with ""Summer Renaissance"" and its interpolation of her classic hit, ""I Feel Love"" (1977). But's its that growling synth bass in ""All Up in Your Mind"" that is very interesting. She should have a listen to ""Sensoria"" by Cabaret Voltaire for inspiration for her next album.

Generally, ""Renaissance"" pushes the boundaries of dance music for Beyonce in a good way. I thought ""Lemonade"" was interesting, but you know what, ""Beyonce"" and ""Renaissance"" just might be her crown jewels.

Here's how ""Renaissance"" compares to Beyonce's other works:

2003 Dangerously in Love: Two and a Half Stars
2006 B'Day: Three and a Half Stars
2008 I Am...Sasha Fierce: Four Stars
2011 4: Four Stars
2013 Beyonce: Five Stars
2016 Lemonade: Four Stars
2022 Renaissance: Five Stars",positive
126,CDs & Vinyl,RENAISSANCE,$10.79,4,"Beyonce claims ""Renaissance"" to be her rebirth, and while i'm not totally convinced of the chanteuses stretched though zesty marketing flair, I was not entirely sure what to think of this set when released. I listened to some samples and wasn't moved but was interested. It's fascinating how this set plays out. The beats are dizzying and tastefully done and while Beyonce's a great (and underrated) vocalist, she downplays her voice here, hiding beneath the pulsating and hypnotic beats. It's almost as through Beyonce went Britney Spears and there is some use of production tricks where Beyonce sounds robotic. This is a producer's paradise, where the vocals take second place to the beat.

On the 16 tracks sprawled out as a continually sequenced dance fest, Beyonce raps (not kidding) and sings the songs with much charisma, as only the baddest bey in the game can. The result is an intoxicating rush of sound. I much enjoyed this album. Listen to ""Cozy"". It's a dancefloor jam where Beyonce sets a lyrical play about being comfortable in your own skin. Coming from Beyonce, it's believable and the beyhive no doubt will eat it up. Of note is also ""Break My Soul"". It's so liberating and there's no doubt that the beyhive and others will enjoy its liberating message. Truth be told: this is probably Beyonce's most liberating and fun album.....well, on second thought IT IS. It's filled with positive messages....Just what we need in this world right now.

I enjoyed the sound of this album. It's different from Bey's other albums, but there is still a trace of the Beyonce we all know from previous albums. I can only imagine what the other acts will sound like and if it's any indication, with this set being stuck in my player, The Beyhive has lots of great music to look forward to. 4 and a half stars. Highly recommended.

176,CDs & Vinyl,Against The Odds: 1974-1982[8 CD],$93.44,3,"Good start, missed opportunity.

Many of the bonus tracks on the 2001 cd remastered are missing!

Why when there is so much space on the bonus cds???

How they missed these, about 10 in total",fair
177,CDs & Vinyl,Against The Odds: 1974-1982[8 CD],$93.44,4,"This box set contains the band's first six albums, plus demos, alternate takes, and other rarities, for a total of eight CDs.

Many of the extra tracks have appeared on previous releases, so it's hard to say that there is a lot of new material here. However, the sound quality appears to be better than that of previous reissues, suggesting that this set is a welcome upgrade.

Aside from being able to get all of those first six albums in one fell swoop, perhaps the real draw of this box set is the 128-page hardcover book that comes with it. Lots of great photos, plus an album by album, song by song review of the contents with comments from the band and its producers. The CDs are stored in pockets in the inside front and back covers, with each disc in its corresponding album sleeve. The whole thing fits into an LP-sized slipcase.

Now, this set is by no means complete. A check of streaming sites and discogs will reveal plenty that has not been included, such as 12-inch mixes and live recordings included on b-sides. But the most notable omission is a real head-scratcher: the 12-inch ""disco version"" of ""Heart of Glass"". This is especially curious because for many years it replaced the album version on Parallel Lines. Fortunately, it can be found on a 2018 digital EP released by the same company (so presumably the sound quality would be similar, if not identical)—but leaving out the best-known version of the band's best-known song seems like a poor decision, especially since there is more than enough space on the Parallel Lines disc to accommodate it.",positive
178,CDs & Vinyl,Against The Odds: 1974-1982[8 CD],$93.44,4,"Sound wise this boxset is pristine Compared to the 2001 cds these new ones are a notch above with the right amount of warmth and loudness. Presented with a lavish book containing in depth interviews with band members and a comprehensive discography this boxset is very well done.

179,CDs & Vinyl,Harry Styles,$27.97,5,Great album. Nice vinyl pressing. Sounds great,positive
180,CDs & Vinyl,Harry Styles,$27.97,5,"Before I write the rest of this review, let me begin by saying this is a good album. If you're into ""electronicized"", computer-generated and perfectly packaged music, then don't buy this album. If you want to listen to something honest that is a statement of the musician's inspirational influences and feelings, then this would be a good album to buy.

To be honest, I really did not know anything about One Direction. I have been living in China since 2011, internet controls were stringent and most of the television stations were Chinese programs. I would see them on calendars when I came home during the semester break, and I laughed about them, calling them ""One Dimension"". I've been through a few rounds of boy bands (New Kids on the Block, Backstreet Boys, NSync, Westlife, etc.), and the product has tended to be the same. The only song I had known by them (until this summer) was ""Kiss You"". When I worked in Zhuhai, China, there were stations from Hong Kong that televised western shows, and I happened to see the video for ""Kiss You"" in 2014 and really liked the song. So I downloaded it on my pc. I listened to it once in a while, but that was all I knew of One Direction.

This past summer (2017), I had been feeling really depressed, dealing with the stalled direction of my life. Remembering how happy that ""Kiss You"" video had been years earlier, I looked it up on YouTube and played it. And played it again. Other videos by One Direction popped up on the suggestion list, so I watched those as well. As a 46 year old woman, it might seem silly, but those songs/videos by One Direction really cheered me up and gave me the emotional lift I needed. And some of their songs are reflective/beautiful.... Of course, I could see that they were a very well-packaged product.

Anyone who watched these videos couldn't ignore Harry Styles' enthusiasm for performing and singing. I happened to watch the One Direction Car Karaoke with James Corden, and I was impressed by Styles' way of singing. So....

I looked Harry Styles up on YouTube, and found this album. I was just curious. I had no plan to buy any of this music, either by One Direction or Styles' solo album. Then I read a review of this album, and it convinced me to try it. First of all, I'm amazed at the obsessive level of knowledge Styles' fans tend to have of his life; nevertheless, that fan's review, telling how he is an ""old soul"" when it comes to his musical influences and how he loved artists from the 1970's was enough to push me to buy this album. I grew up in the 1970's, and I still mainly listen to 1970's music. The only modern artist I buy is Josh Groban - no one else.

Well, I ended up buying Harry Styles' album and also the albums by One Direction. For One Direction fans, don't expect this to be a continuation of the music with which you have learned to cheer on Styles. There is a lot of influence from the 1970's in here, I can see it in the nuance of the instrumentation and also how he sings some of the songs. He did not go the techno-style route, nor are any of these the fun romps that One Direction typically recorded. It's not 21st-century style ballads, either. As one of the other reviewers said, there is some ""old soul"" in this music; for me, who does not like most of the music put out these past 17 years, these songs have more soul. I'm really glad I bought this.

All that said, once Mr. Styles has lived a little bit more of life (his life with One Direction has been somewhat of a controlled production, I assume), I think he will be able to grow as a lyricist. I appreciate how all the songs on this album were written by him and are not all just a self-indulgent self-promotion of his personal life (like some current musical recording stars), but some are a bit more universal in scope. He just needs to bring a bit more poetry to his song lyrics in the future.... At least, this is what I think.

This is a very good first solo album from Mr. Styles. I'm looking forward to seeing what he does with his second album.

****Update on my impression*****
Now that I've had this album for about 1 month, I wanted to update my impression. The more I play this album, the more I like it. I stick with what I said about the lyrical style, but the music and singing are really good to listen to. I hope other people can give it a try. Forget that Harry Styles was in One Direction and just listen to the music. It's really good.",positive

189,CDs & Vinyl,Harry’s House,$10.97,4,"My 10 year old and I LOVE Harry Styles and have all of his albums. Fine Line is still my favorite album of his, but this is an awesome album too - it has a lot of funky 70s beats as well as a Phil Spector wall of sound feel to some of the songs. Harry's voice is excellent, great for slow and fast songs. ""As It Was"" is my favorite, but I also love ""Music for a Sushi Restaurant,"" ""Late Night Talking,"" ""Love of My Life,"" and ""Keep Driving."" The only song that I don't like is ""Boyfriends."" If you're a Harry fan, you'll love it. Even my mom who had no idea who he was liked a lot of the songs when we listened to it as we drove to the beach- she said they had a 70s feel. Harry has really come into his own and you can tell he loves the music he makes now as a solo artist.

My only complaint is the terrible cardboard packaging, it arrived a little bent on one corner. The hard clear cases are so much better because it actually protects the inserts and CD. It's also awkward to take out because the opening has you pulling it out from the center. Redo the packaging please.",positive

The soundtrack in general is a great mix of blues, hip hop, some rap, traditional Elvis himself along with Butler's film versions, and covers of Elvis songs with new material from other artist's such as Kacey Musgraves, Stevie Nicks, Eminem, etc. I feel the soundtrack well captures the essence of the film itself and I do believe all songs are from the film, contrary to some of the reviews here, though some may have been very briefly heard. If you were expecting only Elvis songs, I recommend listening to this soundtrack a couple of times before dismissing it. I love every single song on it and though I’m an older listener who was never much into rap, the rap songs are among my favorites, and if you don’t think they are from the movie, you didn't stay for the end credits, did you? ;) I'll be listening to this soundtrack again and again for a long time.",positive
230,CDs & Vinyl,ELVIS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),$13.96,4,"...it's too bad the physical CD doesn't include the same songs as the download version because there are some important songs missing from the CD like Elvis' I'm Coming Home, Vegas Rehearsals/That's All Right, Shonka Dukureh's (rest in peace) Hound Dog and Austin Butler covering Hound Dog, among other Elvis (and various artists) greats. Still, it's worth adding to my collection. The highlights for me are the new mixes of Elvis favorites Burning Love, Suspicious Minds and Polk Salad Annie. There's a mix of Crawfish and Fever which is kind of fun. I also love PNAU's remix of Don't Fly Away, which starts out as Suspicious Minds and after a couple of minutes you hear ""Don't Fly Away"" and lyrics from Elvis' Any Day Now. I think the two songs blend well together. I'll be honest, I bought this for the Elvis songs, but I do like Tupelo Shuffle by Swae Lee and Diplo. I also think Austin Butler did a fantastic job on Baby Let's Play House and Trouble and these are the only two Austin Butler songs on the physical CD. Kacey Musgraves cover of Can't Help Falling In Love is lovely and Pavari's version of Suspicious Minds is growing on me, too. I bought the physical CD as I wanted the info booklet that comes with it and then I headed to iTunes and bought the other songs that didn't make the CD. Then I'll put my favorites on one CD to make up my own ELVIS soundtrack.",positive
231,CDs & Vinyl,ELVIS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),$13.96,4,"I would have given the Elvis soundtrack CD a lower rating for the physical CD, but the digital download (a free AutoRip when you buy the CD) definitely brings the rating up, with 15 additional tracks, totaling two hours of music. I could do without the profanity laden Eminen track, and there are a couple of other so-so tracks, but overall I enjoyed the soundtrack with some new mixes of Elvis classics.

234,CDs & Vinyl,ELVIS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),$13.96,5,"Baz Luhrmann's ELVIS has made Elvis Presley relevant to the general public again, as legend, as pop music performer, as social / cultural phenomenon. And age-wise, it's an across-the-board awakening / reawakening if the audience I saw the movie with is any indication. Some 45 years after his death, Elvis finally achieves one of the goals he never managed to reach in his lifetime -- he's starring in an A-list film, which has become a surprisingly huge hit. This various artist soundtrack, dominated by a whole lot of Elvis, totally gets the film and reflects its glories in miniature. It's an aural joy to behold. Will all Elvis fans love it? Unlikely. Will fans of the film go for it? Absolutely and in a big way. Five star-studded capes and jumpsuits from me. Can't wait for a director's cut of the film on DVD/Blu-ray; hope one's in the works!",positive

I'm enjoying this cd. Good songs on it and The Temptations sound good. I really like the song with Smokey, Is it gonna be yes or no. I've been hearing, oh, they don't sound the same???

249,CDs & Vinyl,Planet Zero,$11.99,5,"After listening to the first few songs on this album, I found myself sitting in the den surrounded by all the speakers of my old-school stereo system blasting thinking ... what the hell just happened here? And then I realized; this music rocked me to my soul, moved me, and made me realize that through all these years of listening to Shinedown, they've really just been in the chrysalis, waiting to emerge on this album as the best version of themselves we've ever known.

There will be, no doubt, people who compare this to earlier albums. I won't do much of that. I love those earlier albums, but the thing I want to share most with all of you is simply that Shinedown has emerged from recent years to become greater than the greatest version of themselves we ever thought they could be.

I admit when I first heard the single ""Planet Zero,"" I liked it, but it took a couple times before it got inside me and made me realize, ""hey man, this is the real stuff ... they're talking about it and making you feel it, and making you nod your head and say, yeah, man, that's it ... I get it, that's it."" And yet I had no idea what was waiting for me on the rest of this album.

The opening song ""No Sleep Tonight"" blew me away. It's almost cliché these days to say it, but hey, it's a fact: I spent the '80s listening to heavy metal and thrash (still some of my favorite music), but I expected no such thing from Shinedown at this stage of the game as that which came roaring out of my speakers as I spun this album's first song. Brutal, hard hitting, and melodic as hell, with a hook so deep I have no doubt it'll hang with me for days.

""Dysfunctional You"" instantly dug in and cut me, yet lifted me up and carried me away ... it's this kind of thing that seemed to be taking shape on Attention Attention but wasn't yet fully formed. A song that speaks truth with all its sharp edges ... and still manages to lift us all up. This is just plain great music.

I have several other top call-outs here: ""America Burning,"" ""A Symptom of Being Human,"" ""The Saints of Violence and Innuendo,"" just to name the ones that stand out right now. I'm sure as I listen to this album over the next few weeks (months, years), it will reveal its layers to me and I'll lie in the dark wishing I'd said this differently.

But hey, for now, just know -- if you're a Shinedown fan divided by the old stuff vs. new stuff, whichever side of the fence on which you sit today, I encourage you to buy this album and listen to it with all your heart and soul. Take it from an old dad metal head; this is the kind of music we music-lovers need to carry us through the tough times, to encourage and push us forward ... even if things are falling apart around us. There's always something better on the other side, and you couldn't ask for a better soundtrack to get there.",positive
250,CDs & Vinyl,Planet Zero,$11.99,5,"So we are well into 2022 and this year has seen more great music than I can remember in recent times. I guess artists have had much to say...just like us, regular humans.
So the bad. In my opinion this is not the best produced/mastered album i have heard this year. It may be my system but when you have albums like scoring the end of the world or imperia, this one almost hurts the ears when it is cranked up. Buuut, you still want to crank it...
The good is pretty much everything else about it. This will make you headbang and cry within minutes. The ""story"" is not all that original...an alien planet controlled by machines to where your life is compliance, but there is more to being human.
Buuuut, the lyrics are written in a way that anyone can relate. As I said, you can have a ""rockfest"" and then get hit with, ""it is just a symptom of being human"" and the conflict and reality of this album will punch you right in the face. And let us talk ""catchyness"", don't know that that is a real word, but somehow every song on this monster will get you wanting to sing along.
So, I don't love the production, but that aside, this is still in my top 3 albums of 2022. This is a product of a great story, very well written, and a bunch of anthems that are catchy as all get out. Highly recommended along with ""scoring the end of the world"" and ""imperia"" which are...in my opinion...the 3 best rock albums of 2022.......so far",positive
251,CDs & Vinyl,Planet Zero,$11.99,5,"Not since Tony Carey's Planet P project has there been such a wonderfully scary and amusing concept album. It is very similar to Planet P Pink World: telling a story in music. In Pink World ""Artemus"" is the boy who couldn't talk almost like ""Tommy"" by the Who who was deaf, dumb and blind. Planet Zero is more a statement about where America may be headed on a more serious side with some whimsical narratives thrown in between songs which vary in tempo. A very Prog piece of work. Enjoy!",positive
252,CDs & Vinyl,Planet Zero,$11.99,5,"Planet Zero by Shinedown has both a creative and science fiction futuristic feel to the music compilation. I enjoy how the tracks touch on multiple themes of life in both an abstract yet magnetic manner. For instance America Burning and Daylight touch on two polar opposite life themes yet also seamlessly blend together for the connective formation of Planet Zero. The music splashed across a multiple number of tracks in Planet Zero enhance the hard rock energy of Planet Zero. I pre-ordered this music collection via Amazon in early February this year and felt that the wait was worth it, still even if you are pondering whether to get this collection at the time of this summer writing you might enjoy this music collection if you have enjoyed any of the previous Shinedown songs on Attention Attention andor Threat to Survival or if you are receptive to listening to hard rock music (if you are a novice to listening to Shinedown music).",positive
253,CDs & Vinyl,Planet Zero,$11.99,5,"This album is absolutely amazing! I love Shinedown's music and have never been disappointed with any of their previous releases, but this one will be hard to top. There is a theme running through all the songs which are tied together with brief segues that enhance the message of the music. They touch on such topics as 'cancel culture' and 'mono-think' and it all comes together beautifully. I haven't heard an album this good since Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' and I feel 'Planet Zero' compares favorably with that classic. Just a great work.",positive
254,CDs & Vinyl,Planet Zero,$11.99,5,"It took guts for these guys to know that they would offend some of their own fans (who are the dramatic social media addicted cancer of society) and put forth a message they thought was of the utmost importance for this day and age. The point they wanted to drive home is clearly a warning to humanity, an optimistic warning, but still a warning. They know that human civilization has reached the end if people don't change quickly and they're doing what they can to try to help.
The album listened to from beginning to end is a true masterpiece. Very cohesive. They told a story with attention attention, and this is done the same way. Thanks to Shinedown. I have all the albums since 2003 and this is the best.",positive
