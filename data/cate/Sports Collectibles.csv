I was looking for a bit of fun for my child. The packs we got were some of the old generic clear three packs then a freer and some other wax package. One pack was obviously opened before. This was bought to be a little treasure hunt. I do not buy scratch off tickets that are already scratched off. Likewise, I prefer card packs to be unopened. So my guess is that one will not have any treasure. So I am feeling a little meh about it. Just send 5 wax sealed packs and I think I would be happy.

61,Sports Collectibles,"600 Baseball Cards Including Babe Ruth, Unopened Packs, Many Stars, and Hall-of-famers. Ships in Brand New White Box Perfect for Gift Giving. Includes At Least One Original Unopened Pack of Topps Vintage Baseball Cards That Is At Least 25 Years Old!",$21.94,4,"I spent an Amazon gift card and bought this along with a couple 2022 wax boxes out of morbid curiosity since I see this on sale all of the time. I recently started collecting again and enjoying buying large lots from goodwill and the hunt of looking for cards so I though it would be interesting to compare.

The cards were in great condition and packaged well. The result, mostly junk wax era. The Babe Ruth card is from a 1992 set and worth about a quarter. There were ten 80's and 90's star cards worth between 25 cents and 2 dollars packaged in plastic with the Ruth card. The one pack was 94 stadium club and I got a decent Frank Thomas insert card. The 600 cards were junk wax including 90 leaf, 90 fleer, 92 donruss and 91 topps. Mostly commons, Many repeats, but a few star players including a 91 topps Chipper Jones rookie. There were about 100 minor league cards which didnt yield much and strangely about 150 Julio Franco cards ranging from 86-94. I have yet to look through those, but there seem to at least be some inserts.

The four star rating is five stars for packaging and condition but three stars for cards. Ive seen much better but also seen much worse. My guess is that there is some variance in value, and what myself and others got is due to the luck of the draw. You will likely get your moneys worth for 25 dollars but don't expect to find a hidden gem or turn a profit.",positive

I also liked the variety of cards in the set, for example different years and different brands such as Upper Deck, Topps, Donruss and lots of rookies. All collector's love rookies.

75,Sports Collectibles,Baseball Card Collector Box With Over 500 Cards,$19.95,4,"This is a really good value. The cards have always been in great condition. There‚Äôs always been the over produced wax packs, but there‚Äôs also been cards I‚Äôve not seen a lot of before. Two Nolan Ryan cards also sit on top of the set, which is my favorite part.
All that to say, The first time I bought this, I was like a kid in a candy store. Opened it up and there were a bunch of HOF‚Äôs, a bunch of cards from the two teams I collect, and a good diverse selection of cards from many different years. However, the past two I‚Äôve ordered have been much more watered down. Only had 4-5 HOF‚Äôs in these last two boxes each (there are 500 cards). Less than 10 of the two teams I collect (not huge market teams), and A LOT of doubles and triples of players. I even had four of the same guy consecutively.
My point is that where it seemed as though before they were just taking a chunk out of a set or from a pack, now It seems as though they‚Äôve been sorted through and the company is purposely holding back the fun/valuable cards.
It is still fun to open and have 500 cards and for the price it is great for building a collection. But, if you are looking to score some HOF‚Äôs, your favorite players or teams, you might just be better off buying old packs.",positive

80,Sports Collectibles,Baseball Card Collector Box With Over 500 Cards,$19.95,3,"This was the 2nd time I have ordered this box. Now the 1st time there was no option to write a review. Despite not recieving the 1 card from the 1950s or 2 from the 1960s as promised in the description and one of the main reasons I purchased this item, the 1st box had a decent amount of rookies and inserts including numbered cards. Although disapointed from no vintage cards the inserts and rookies I did gain, which were almost a 1/4 of the 1st box I felt made up for it.
As a avid collector of baseball cards I felt it was a good buy and I would get a another one. This time I got one as a birthday gift. Let's just say I am glad this time my money wasn't used to purchase the item, but instead a gift card. Out of over 500 cards I recieved only 13 were rookies or inserts. The rest were just mostly complete sets of cards from the late 80s with mostly no names. I will give credit where it is due, I did recieve my one card from the 50s and 2 from the 60s as promised in the description as long as being shipped in a penny case then a hard case, to which I was very happy about. However, the 5 cards from the 1970s were not the best condition. The corners showed signs of rounding and wear. Of those 5 cards from the 70s, one was a checklist. If your not a true collector or want some vintage cards then buy it. Otherwise unless you need a paperweight or some kindle for fires, I'd stay away. This item is a GAMBLE. Caveat Emptor.",fair

153,Sports Collectibles,2021 Panini Prizm Draft Football BLASTER box (6 pks/bx),$35.99,4,"This box is all rookie draft prism cards, every single card. All these cards I'm talking about are rookie/draft prism cards. That's all that's in this box. For thirty rookie draft cards alone this would be a perfect price, but this is much more than a normal rookie draft box.
This box includes rookies not only from this year but rookies that have been drafted as far as years ago. This gives you the chance to get the most infamous rookies draft cards from multiple drafts which makes this box really good value. This box, for me, yielded cards from Justin fields all the way back to Philip rivers.
This box also gives many very good cards. This box gave me the most hits I've ever seen in a normal-sized box. This isn't like those other boxes that drown 1 decent or good card in a pack of 6 other trash cards, with six packs per box. This box has at least just as many good cards as bad, and mine actually had more. I got 17 great cards, meaning big names, compared to just 13 bad cards. Each pack had a guaranteed All American Draft prism and another special prizm.
Many other reviews I've seen on this product mention the fact that these cards arrive warped. This is not because of damaging shipping. This is not because the cards are cheap or poorly made, low value, harshly handled, or any kind of faulty production. This is naturally because of the material used to make the shiny surfaces of the cards, it naturally warps cards slightly. This does not take away from the value, it does not make the cards less valuable than other cards, it is just normal and still does grant a perfect 10 if you get the card graded in perfect condition, just the same way as literally any other trading card.

I got many exciting cards from just this one box:
- all American justin fields, prism draft picks, rookie
- green prism Patrick Mahomes II, prism draft picks
- Will Fuller V, prism draft picks
- Myles Garret, prism draft picks
- Justin Herbert, prism draft picks
- Crusade Micah Parsons, prism draft picks, rookie
- Green Circles Prism Tyreek Hill, prism draft picks [03/25]
- Rainbow Silver Prism Tylan Wallace, prism draft picks, rookie (WR drafted 4th round to the Ravens)
- Jarvis Landry, prism draft picks
- Josh Allen, prism draft picks (QB)
- Green Prism Davante Adams, prism draft picks
- Travis Kelce, prism draft picks
- Crusade Ja'marr Chase, prism draft picks, rookie
- Purple Wave Prism Rashod Bateman, prism draft picks, rookie
- Philip Rivers, prism draft picks
- Tyreek Hill, prism draft picks
- Saquon Barkley, prism draft picks",positive

I am into this shim sham for well over $160 and I am livid. I bought 3 orders and they were mostly duplicates. I waited a week and bought another 3 orders and two of the packs were IDENTICAL with garbage players. I literally have 4 cards of the same player multiple times. This was for me and my son to enjoy and you took advantage.,negative
