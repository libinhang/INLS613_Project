0,Baby,"Baby Wipes, Pampers Sensitive Water Based Baby Diaper Wipes, Hypoallergenic and Unscented",$12.47 - $62.99,5,"I've been using these Pampers sensitive wipes for years. These are also the wipes that provided at the hospital so they're obviously very well trusted. This box comes with 8 packs of 72 wipes. Keep in mind that these are ""refillable"" wipes so they don't come with the pop top, but rather the resealable sticker. The wipes are water based, thick, and saturated so it's gentle yet very effective at cleaning my baby's skin. My baby was born a preemie so I was very cautious about choosing certain products for her. She has not had any bad reactions to these wipes at all. And if you join the Pampers Club, you can scan in the codes and get discounts on future purchases!! Highly recommend.",positive

10,Baby,Diapers - Pampers Swaddlers Disposable Baby Diapers,$42.94 - $136.06,5,They arrived quickly and do what they’re supposed to do. Unfortunately my baby’s skin didn’t agree with the brand and they gave her a rash which I’m learning is pretty common with this brand although that obviously won’t be the case for every baby. Huggies or honest brand absorb a lot better without the irritation.,positive
11,Baby,Diapers - Pampers Swaddlers Disposable Baby Diapers,$42.94 - $136.06,5,Most of the time these diapers are double boxed in a pampers box and an amazon box. This time it was only 1 brown cardboard box. This is great! Much less waste!,positive

I’m on my 3rd and final baby and after 8 years of being a faithful Pampers user, I won’t use any other diapers!

20,Baby,"WaterWipes Original Baby Wipes, 99.9% Water, Unscented & Hypoallergenic for Sensitive Newborn Skin",$10.26 - $55.46,5,"When I first delivered my son the hospital supplied us with  Huggies Little Snugglers  diapers and  Pampers Sensitive Wipes . When he was very little the diapers were perfectly fine even though I had my heart set on pampers and pre-bought a bunch of preemies, newborns and size 1's. Long story short - after a couple of weeks the Huggies started to leak and we we had to switch brands.I was super glad we had stocked up on Pampers diapers, which haven't failed us thus far.

HOWEVER, I do have to say that the Pampers wipes were not so great. The hospital gave us some wipes to take home with us and I bought about a million before little man was born.

After just a few days out of the hospital, we noticed that his little bum was a bit red and irritated and I assumed he was somehow getting a diaper rash - which was perplexing because my fiance and are I always on top of his hygiene. We took him to the pediatrician who told us NO to Pampers, even the sensitive kind, and that she has had babies come into her office with chemical burns from wipes such as Pampers and Huggies.

Her suggestion (or kind of demand) was that we buy giant cotton balls and use warm water. WELL, if you're a new parent or a parent in general and living in the real world - this is not as easy-peasy as it sounds. I was willing to do it because, well, doctors orders and I don't want my son to be harmed in any way. My fiance was less than convinced about this process but I was not about to let him use Pampers or Huggies or basically any other kind of chemical wipe. But I certainly I wasn't going to let him get out of diaper duty because it was too much of an inconvenience to use cotton balls and water.

I did some investigating and was a little unsettled about the hidden ingredients in most baby wipe brands.According to the Environmental Working Group's analysis of ingredients commonly found in products such as cosmetics and baby wipes - up to 95% of baby wipes, specifically, may be contaminated with impurities that are, mind-boggingly- not regulated by the government. While the ingredients in the wipes aren't necessary toxic in themselves - chemical carcinogens, namely nitrosamines, can potentially form during the manufacturing process, during interaction with what the item is packaged in and after the product has been opened and stored. Essentially, some of the ingredients in baby wipes become contaminated for the aforementioned reasons and thus become entirely different ingredients that technically are not required to be disclosed to customers.

I'm not a chemist and I know plenty of people who use and swear by Pampers and Huggie's wipes. Their babies and children are seemingly fine. It's doubtful every pack of baby wipes is going to cause cancer or contact dermatitis. And while not an alarmist - nonetheless, I was concerned about the information I came across. Also, I did not want to defy our son's doctor because she's totally awesome and an itty itty bit intimdiating. So that was it for me. I love you Pampers Swaddlers but your wipes gotta go and you can take most of your competitor brands with you.

Except WaterWipes. When I found out these wipes were made of mostly water with a hint of grapefruit extract - I felt like this could be an excellent compromise between warm water and cotton balls and easily disposable and safe wipes IF WaperWipes lived up to its claims. I read up on the Amazon reviews and the majority of the reviews were positive and encouraging; thus I decided it was definitely worth trying. I must say that WaterWipes has lived up to its promises.

Some of the reviewers claim these wipes are too dry. I kind of find this to be an issue with wipes in general. I've never used a brand of wipes that were super moist and stayed that way. It's just par for the course, IMO.

I love these wipes. They are gentle enough to use anywhere. I even sometimes use them to remove my makeup in a pinch, even scrub off mascara. At first I thought the tiny bit of grapefruit extract might burn my eyes, but it did not. Also, there is no heavy fragrance to WaterWipes, which I can't stand in most baby products. The wipes don't dry out while being stored. They don't turn yellow or start to look burnt in the wipe warmers like some of the other brands I've used or seen used.

I find it silly that some people complain about the price because it only has water and grapefruit extract. I'd rather pay more for simplicity that pay less for a bunch of chemicals that gave my baby red skin that was on the verge of becoming raw had our doctor not stopped us in time. I don't find the price to be outrageous - but even if it were - I'd probably still buy them for the sake of convenience. And, as I said, I like having them around for myself. I have a wipe warmer in every room and if I need to wash little man's face from spit up or his hands from drool or my hands from baby formula - no need to dash to the sink every time. I use these wipes instead, they are very multi-purposed.

The one little complaint I have is that they don't seem to come apart easily. I'm NEVER ever able to pull them out individually from the wipe warmers so we just lift the whole thing up and grab what we need. My fiance, my friend who is frequently here and mostly anyone else is able to take one wipe at a time this way. But I can't help but manage to grab AT LEAST four every time, but that problem seems to be on my end. Also, before we got the WaterWipes, we seemed to have a problem with ANY brand of wipes easily dispensing from the warmer or their packages. This annoys me about wipes in general but nothing is really perfect. These wipes, however, come pretty darn close.

I won't buy anything else and I won't recommend anything else.",positive

What I did not like about my delivery was the person who delivered these items, plus 2 other items inside the same box, set the box on the ground right under our doorbell but never rang it to give us a ""heads up"" that it had been delivered. That area is not covered and we are in our monsoon season - lots of rain, etc..

That said - these were the only wipes I could use after target changed their up&up formulation on their hypoallergenic wipes so I continued paying $$$ because I didn’t have another choice. They perform well (though personally I think they’re a bit thin for their price). Now that our son is potty trained, they’re excellent for keeping in my purse for his hands/face.",positive

Walmart parent choice wipes although is thicker, it’s more rough on babies skin. Pampers sensitive is softer but has more chemical in it so I dont use it for anything else beside her bottom. Both has a slight chemical odor.

Water wipes are non textured so they are more gentle on my baby. It has no chemical smell to it, I can literally use it to wipe her face, hands without worries. My baby never have any rash with water wipes.",positive

We take them hiking and to the beach. If you put them in the cooler and keep them cold, they’re super refreshing to wipe off with after. When you’re driving and tired, shove a couple in the AC slats, let them get nice and cold then use on your face. Really helps when you don’t have coffee handy.",positive

28,Baby,"WaterWipes Original Baby Wipes, 99.9% Water, Unscented & Hypoallergenic for Sensitive Newborn Skin",$10.26 - $55.46,5,"I have been using water wipes since my daughter was born 3/3/21.
We have only ever used water wipes and they have been amazing.

However, we recently bought a box of them, and man they are not cheap….but whatever ingredients have been changed; is god awful.

These wipes have given my baby the worst, worst rash in the entire world. Her poor skin has been beyond raw and red. Instantly after one diaper change. The skin is practically burned and leaves her skin open.
For a second I thought maybe it could have been the diapers. But I have changed diapers 3 times now because of this, and nothing had changed. I then stopped using these new wipes, and the rash and started to fade away.

The packaging is different. They smell like chemicals!!!!! I compared an old pack I bought to the new pack; and the chemical smell is UNREAL. It is night and day with the smell!!!! They are nothing like the water wipes we have been using.

I can not express how upset I am by this. How much money we have put into this company, only to change the ingredients leaving my daughters poor bottom burnt and raw.",positive
29,Baby,"WaterWipes Original Baby Wipes, 99.9% Water, Unscented & Hypoallergenic for Sensitive Newborn Skin",$10.26 - $55.46,4,"My daughter has broken out in eczema in the past from other wipes. Ever since we switched to water wiped we have had zero issues! I read that the wipes contained formaldehyde releasing agents which upset me, and i reached out to the company. This was their response and I was pleased with it!
""We are happy to explain our position and views on the study you are referring to.

Firstly, I want to reassure you that nothing, absolutely nothing, matters more to us than you or your baby’s skin. Our company was started because of a father’s concern for his daughter’s sensitive skin so we know how important this is to parents and people who use our products daily.

On ingredients, we want to assure you that we are not hiding anything from you or any other people who use our wipes. Our formulation does not contain formaldehyde or formaldehyde releasing agents. On our packs, you see two ingredients listed (99.9% purified Irish water and a drop of fruit extract) and that’s all we ever add. But you’ll also see that we declare BAK on our products (which is a trace component from our fruit seed extract).

With the references to Formaldehyde below, firstly, we want to be clear that we have not participated in this study in anyway, so cannot verify any of the claims made. We have reviewed the full study text you raised
and we have found multiple instances in the paper where the author has queried the limitations, and called for further studies to be able to confirm the results presented within the paper.

In addition, our WaterWipes products are assessed and subject to sale by stringent local and international laws and regulation, alongside our own independent tests that we regularly carry out. It’s also something that other organizations have quite rightly checked when accrediting us – it’s how we have been approved by the Skin Health Alliance and been awarded the National Eczema Associations Seal of Acceptance, so our products have been tested and ratified by other external firms.

I hope the above helps explain our position and alleviates any concerns you may have had regarding our products. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to get in contact.""
We have continued to use these fory daughter and my newest baby without any issues. My only complaint is i wish the wipes were a little textured to help with cleaning. Otherwise they are perfect!",positive
30,Baby,Amazon Brand - Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers,$8.15 - $33.81,4,"My son was born in 2020, I tried to use pampers but my child constantly had diaper rashes and eczema outbreaks related to contact dermatitis. I found this product in Jan 2021 and never turned back. No diaper rash or eczema around his buttocks since using Mama Bear Gentle and it was AFFORDABLE.
HOWEVER, I am very upset that they have double the price of these diapers. When I began purchasing this product one box of 104 diapers cost $27/box size 6... NOW it is $47/box. I was hoping that this product would not conform to the inflation prices like pampers, but this doesn't seem to be the case.
For example, on July 23, 2022, I purchased 108 diapers/box of size 6 diapers was $28.55... On August 5, 2022, I purchased the same box and it was $43.54 (no taxes were added to either of these prices).
HOW CAN YOU JUMP IN PRICE THAT MUCH IN LESS THAN A MONTH??? WTF. time to start potty training.
I wanted to give a heads up to moms on a budget. This product used to be affordable; now I would go with Lure pampers for more absorbability. Comparatively, Lure is a better product, the only reason I chose a Mama Bear product was its hypoallergenic properties and it was affordable ($28/box of 104 diapers) NOW IT IS NOT THIS PRICE!",positive
31,Baby,Amazon Brand - Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers,$8.15 - $33.81,4,"I did a review recently, but I decided to give the Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers another try since they do run a lot bigger than Parent's Choice Dry and Gentle Diapers. I was looking for a bigger diaper & Cheaper diaper for my now 3 year old son. I compared the Amazon Mama Bear Diapers with Walmart Parents Choice Dry & Gentle Diapers and the Mama Bear is just as soft, their wider, longer, and run a lot bigger yahhhhh! When I decided to purchase a big box of Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers Size 6 they make the Parents Choice Diapers size 6 look like a size 4. Then I can't find a size 7 in Parents Choice because their either bought out or out of stock sometimes. I love that Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers has no chemical smells, free of bleach dyes, perfumes, parabens, phlathates, latex, no tested on animals, zero to waste to landfills, not tested on animals. When I compared Amazon Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers with Walmart Parent's Choice Dry and Gentle Diapers the absorption padding is made with different padding material. When I did a test on each brand the Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers absorption in the diaper padding absorbs way more slower than the Parent's Choice Dry and Gentle Diapers. The Mama Bear Diapers remains wet to the touch for a long while, on the other hand Parent's Choice Dry & Gentle Diapers absorb way faster and remains dry to the touch even with a very saturated diaper in the testing of the absorption from each diaper brand. The Amazon Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers aren't a bad cheaper natural diaper alternative, but I most say that Amazon Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers most redo their diaper padding for absorption material improvement to be better, that's the only down fall I have noticed trying the Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers Size 6 on my son is they don't wick away the pee/urine off my baby skin, like I'm use to with other brands that wick away pee off his skin to a dry to the touch. I would say for sure that Mama Bear Gentle Diapers fit my son so well, than any diapers I have tried except for Amazon Earth Eden Diapers fits him really good too. I love the fit of Amazon Mama Bear on my baby, the fit is so amazing!!!! The Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers for some reason reminds me of Pampers Swaddlers, but without the mesh inside the diapers, then the Mama Bear kind of reminds me of Parent's Choice Diapers as well maybe, the price kind of compared. I have used a lot of diaper brands on my son, like I've used Hello Bello, Pampers, Huggies, All Goods, Earth and Eden, Seventh Generation, Parent's Choice, Mama Bear, Fisher Price, Rascals and Friends, and Luvs. I would say that I love the free and clear diapers group: All Good Diapers, Rascals and Friends Diapers, Earth and Eden Diapers, Parent's Choice, and I also like Hello Bello and Mama Bear Diapers, and the none free and clear diapers group: I love Pampers, I kind like Huggies, but just the Huggies Little Smugglers & Huggies Little Movers, and Luvs, but I be hesitant now to buy these brands because of the chemicals, dyes, fragrance, other bad chemicals in conventional diapers, which I didn't know chemicals where in certain diaper brands and also in conventional diapers can cause health issues like diaper rash, allergic reaction, possible urinary track infection from the dyes causing an allergic reaction. What I have noticed in the free and clear group of diapers there's 2 brands that doesn't wick away the urine/pee, and it's Hello Bello Diapers and Mama Bear Diapers. I would now give Amazon Mama Bear Diapers 4 star because they're made for sensitive skin doesn't cause my son Eszema on his butt to flare up, Mama Bear Diapers are free of harsh chemicals, the best fit, and that the run bigger in length and width, plus the price is cheaper than most natural diapers. I use the 20% subscribe & save, plus the Black Friday 20% and the Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers are cheaper than the Parent's Choice. I haven't had any leaks in the daytime, but I haven't tried them overnight yet. I would recommend to people now!!! These Mama Bear Gentle and Dry Diapers are another go to brand for me!!!!!!",positive
32,Baby,Amazon Brand - Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers,$8.15 - $33.81,4,"These are the only brand of diapers that will still fit my child, which is important to us because she is not yet potty trained nor is she ready to start. She's off the charts for her age on growth, so finding something that will comfortably fit and work for us is very important. I'm very disappointed at the price increase. I always thought the price for the diapers was fair. They were not quite as great as Huggies Little Movers, Snugglers, or Pampers Swaddlers (the ""premium"" style diapers from brand names), so I felt happy paying the price we were paying for more diapers in better fitting styles, even if the absorbency and leak protection wasn't as great as the other styles I mentioned. With this price increase, I'm not quite so happy anymore. We are now buying more out of necessity than desire lol. A 25% price increase completely unannounced sucks! Especially since we are on the subscription for diapers. I didn't know the price had gone up til I came to check my next delivery.",positive
33,Baby,Amazon Brand - Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers,$8.15 - $33.81,4,"I got these to try for my infant son, who was around 3 months at the time & was getting a bottle every 3 hours.

Almost every diaper change, we'd have some minor leaks & I am very diligent with changing his diapers, doing it very often. And using these as an overnight diaper, forget it! They would always have leaks. In comparison, Walmart's Parent Choice diapers were less than $6 a bag & they have an excellent quality that wasn't comparable to these Amazon brand ones. I have found that the Parent's Choice brand is hard to beat in quality, absorbency & the price especially, giving you a lot for your money.

Maybe it was smart and on purpose, or maybe someone thought toddlers need a change of pace. In either case that person was seriously wrong.

Let me explain toddlers: polkadots. If the toddler doesn’t get polkadots she doesn’t want to wear a diaper. This has caused us great grief as a result. If you have a pattern or color specific toddler please for the love of god stay away from these diapers.

Your toddler will cause you to spend more money on diapers than you should be spending as a result of this “variety pack” of colors. What ever demon decided this know there’s a small place in hell where toddler demons will run around you in a circle demanding only polkadot diapers!",positive

Initially: I was Very dissapointed. Its for grown-ups, because babie's butts wouldnt handle it. Im a mom of 20 month old twin-girls. Its very thin, very rough, and you will have to dig almost every other tissue, as they are not pulling one after another .
I decided to save a few bucks, and regreated. (Better spend time and go for Kirkland tissues-price-wise and good quality, or spend an extra $$ for your babie's comfort). Will keep a full box for myself.

70,Baby,Liquid I.V. Hydration Multiplier - Passion Fruit - Hydration Powder Packets | Electrolyte Drink Mix | Easy Open Single-Serving Stick | Non-GMO,$17.74 - $225.00,3,"This came highly recommended, and I see it in Costco a lot. I needed to get some hydration packets as I sweat a lot these days and lose a lot of trace minerals, salts, etc. So I purchased this along with several other options.

I wish I could give a half star, as it should be 3.5, but the downsides are too much to allow for 4, so 3 it is.

1 - WAY too much sugar. 11grams is a LOT. Granted it's organic pure cane sugar, which is a step up from what most major brand sports drinks offer, but as an electrolyte, sugar is the least necessary to replenish for most diets.

2 - Second ingredient is Dextrose, which is fructose corn syrup, or fructose, depending on what it's made from, but it's a dried out powdered form of it. It doesn't indicate the sourcing, but even so, it's concentrated sugar, and fructose is 1/2 highly toxic. Pared with Sucrose? I'm wondering what the thought process was here in having a secondary sugar product, and having the top two ingredients be sugar. The added sugar makes even less sense when there's Stevia and Citric acid, so a sweetener and a sweet enhancer. It's most likely to create a better tasting product to sell more. This is more a marketing tactic than anything, knowing that Gatorade is beloved because it's essentially sugar water. Problem is this especially makes it something I won't be purchasing again.

3 - Silicon Dioxide? Why? There's no need to worry about caking with this, as even if the powder forms a solid bond, when it hits water it separates anyhow. At least this tends to just move through the body, but that's unnecessary. It's not inherently bad unless it gets past your gut walls.

4 - Price point? Why so high? It's a bit insane how expensive this is. Is it sourcing? Is it certain doctors taking a cut of profits? If there's a valid reason why your brand is so high when others can keep their prices at a reasonable level and still have great sourcing, then I'm all ears (and a far superior product).

So the pros:

1 - Decent Potassium level

2 - I actually prefer the salt levels, but for most Americans this is actually critical, as we're generally VERY low in Sodium in general. Bad science on the impact of high sodium and correlations to heart attacks (there's no science on direct causation, and the correlative science is sketchy at best). Though I do eat a lot of salt, I do tend to sweat a LOT, so if this were less sugary, I might reconsider (except the price point is ridiculous). There's more hard data on low sodium being dangerous, so this is actually a tremendous positive, potentially higher than the decent Potassium levels. Also, if you take a lot of potassium, you need to balance it out and help your body flush extra with extra sodium, as it then flushes out extra electrolytes, and high potassium is very dangerous.

3 - Vitamin's B3, 6, and 12. Missing the critical 9 though, but good nevertheless. Decent levels, not particularly high compared to other brands but over the recommended levels by a fair amount. Helpful with energy and restoration after a workout (12 helps repair DNA damage).

4 - Vitamin C, but at very low levels. Then again this is mostly for cell repair or if you've taken on sickness, and cleaning out unwanted elements in cells (so cell flushing of what's been repaired). Good to add.

I mean the positives are great, but the price point and high sugar just kill it.",fair

Because the one side was bunched in one place, it was open on the leg thereby leaked all over. So 60 were unusable. Thats almost $30.00 worth of diapers.

That shouldn't happen, and it wasn't happening with the previous batch of the same size diapers.

Second, supposedly these diapers are great for leak protection. I don't find this to be the case, especially when it comes to poop. Almost every time my baby poops, I have to do a wardrobe change.

120,Baby,Baby Registry Welcome Box,$35.00,4,"First off. It looks like you are being charged $35, but when you go to checkout there is a box that should be checked and it should zero out. I Googled it to ensure I didn't get charged.

What was in my box:
A bag
A 3-6 month onesie
A blanket
A bottle of prenatals
A diaper and wipes samples
Breastfeeding samples
Laundry soap sample
Gripe water sample
Prenatal sample
Aquaphor sample
And coupons

The prenatals are the best tasting but they aren't bad and those alone are a $26 value so pretty great to get a full size bottle of those. Beats my last pregnancy's box

The blanket is the very same one I got in my 2019 pregnancy so hasn't changed much. The onesie may be the same but I can't remember. I did use the blanket a lot for my first because it's longer than most baby blankets and my baby was super tall and this one grew with her until 9 months.

Overall, it is actually worth the $35 or maybe more and is worth the small amount of work with your registry to be eligible for it free.",positive
121,Baby,Baby Registry Welcome Box,$35.00,1,"So I met my eligibility requirements. I filled my checklist, am already Prime, and I made a $10 purchase. My ""box"" arrived and like others I was completely underwhelmed by what was inside, but more on that in a moment.

The items I purchased from my registry were two different brands of prenatal moisturizers (for me of course). I removed one of them after I completed the requirements for the box, because I figured - I don't need this anymore, why even keep it on my registry? The other one I actually kept on the registry because I figured I would need it again before my pregnancy was over. Well, it turned out that removing one of the $10 minimum threshold for qualifying items from your welcome box, even after it was delivered to me, actually triggers your box to be charged! So I was charged $35 plus tax for this ""box"" even though I completed all of the steps. Therefore, this warning should exist on Amazon's Baby Registry FAQ page but it does not, so heed it now:
DO NOT REMOVE ANY OF YOUR QUALIFYING PURCHASES OF $10 FROM YOUR REGISTRY IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR BOX (EVEN IF YOU ALREADY RECEIVED YOUR BOX, THEY WILL CHARGE YOU).

I called Amazon support and they told me the only way to reverse this would be to return my box and be refunded for it. I honestly cannot believe that they have access to my order history, can corroborate my explanation, but still refused to make this right and instead the only way to resolve it is by forcing me to return my box. So really, I went through this process for nothing.

On to the quality of the box. I am ONLY reviewing it because I can honestly agree it would not be worth the $35 I was in fact charged for it. I had meagre samples and I really don't see how any of these items would help me make better decisions about what products I may want/need for baby in the future. First off, let's call it what it was: it was a small bag, NOT a box and it contained the following:

-1 swaddle blanket
-1 3-6 mo old onesie (really, why not a 0-3 mo old onesie? but ok)
-1 single pack sample of Dreft laundry detergent
-1 3 ct. pack of diapers
-1 single pack sample of Desitin
-1 single pack sample of Baby ointment
-1 hotel sized bottle of Aveeno baby
-1 4oz. bottle
-1 3pk of honest company wipes (not pictured)

So again maybe if it were in fact only supposed to cost me the $10 I already spent from my registry this would have been fine, but to be charged $35 for this? Absolutely not. I would say there was literally about $10 worth of items here, and I am only counting the full size onesie and blanket because those samples cost manufacturers almost nothing to produce.

I am extremely disappointed with the way Amazon handled this situation and with the box itself. So let me reiterate: DO NOT REMOVE ANY OF ITEMS THAT MAKE UP YOUR QUALIFYING PURCHASES OF $10 FROM YOUR REGISTRY IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR BOX. THEY WILL CHARGE YOU FOR THIS BOX AND IT IS NOT WORTH IT.",negative

124,Baby,Baby Registry Welcome Box,$35.00,4,"I would first like to say obtaining this box was easier than I originally had thought. At first I thought you had to spend $10 off of your registry, AND complete at least 60% of your registry checklist (meaning purchase 60% of the items off your list) but that isn’t what they mean. I just went though the check list and literally check marked what I categories I “completed” So that’s all you need to do, and then add the box to your cart when it allows you and when checking out it’s completely free. So many people are buying this box and complaining of the value but it’s meant to be a free box, don’t purchase it. So the first time I got my box there was a hand sanitizer that had came with it and it spilled over everything, soaking the box inside and out and ruining most of the items inside. I was disappointed of course but messaged Amazon and they sent a replacement right away. The second box (pictured) varies slightly from the first as there is no hand sanitizer this time, an extra sample of wipes, probiotics, and a triple paste that wasn’t in the first one. The last box I think I got a sample shampoo instead of the paste. Overall I wish all boxes were the same, because some of your reviews pictures sure do look amazing but I’m satisfied with my box. It is free after all! The cute little onesie and swaddle are both gender neutral too which is nice",positive

We got a Carter's baby onesie in size 0-3m, a pretty cute swaddling blanket with zebras on it, a Dr. Browns anti-colic 5 ounce bottle, a nanobebe pacifier, and hello bello spray hand sanitizer. However, the 20 count pack of hello bello wipes expires 6/19/22 and my son is due 6/9/22, the teeny tiny bottle of aquaphor expires in August of this year, the Similac coupon we got was expired by the time we got it in the mail, and the coupon for smarty pants prenatals expired two weeks after that. We also got a single load sample of Swash baby laundry detergent and half a dose of the smarty pants prenatal vitamin which isn't expired but why give half a dose? And honestly why give a prenatal vitamin sample at all when you need to take them every single day to be effective. I think all of the nonperishable stuff in the bag made it worth getting if you were already planning on having a registry from Amazon. But I'm really not impressed that the perishable stuff is so close to expiring or was expired when I got it. I'd love to try the hello bello wipes, but no idea if I'll get to use the sample I got since it's so close to my due date.",fair
126,Baby,Baby Registry Welcome Box,$35.00,4,"My first bag was soaked in the hand sanitizer they give you so I had to get a second bag. That one had leaked too just not as much. I’ve seen several reviews about it and agree they should probably bag it separately or just not gift it at all since it’s not holding up with shipping.
The first box had a onesie, hand sanitizer, lip balm, a 3pck of huggies diapers and a same laundry detergent. Certainly not $35 worth, but again it’s free.
My second box had all of that plus a burp cloth, bottle, pacifier, a sample of nursing bags/pads, bubble bath, and diaper rash cream. So a little nicer.

- Easy to make a baby wear these and it creates a good fit with no gaps
- Fits well and holds fine

180,Baby,Pampers Easy Ups Training Pants Boys and Girls,$42.94 - $118.82,5,"I’m officially in love with these pull-ups for my heavy-wetting 3 year old. We’ve tried A LOT of diapers, slip-ons, and pull-ups. He’s autistic and not exactly ready to fully potty train, but knows how to use his potty. We’ve mainly been working on pulling these off and on so he can get the hang of it before wearing his boxer briefs full time. These aren’t the softest material ever, but similar to other Pampers diapers. I think 360s might be a little softer. Compared to a 360, Easy Ups. They’re a little shorter in height and not as thick… which helps them feel more like underwear. They’re not as short as some training pants that claim to fit like underwear (like Pull-ups brand or Honest Company training pants… those show a lot of plumber butt!).

He drinks like a fish, and luckily these hold a ton of liquid! The only time he leaked was when these were too small. I have to size up in order to prevent that. He’s about 36.6 lbs and wears mostly 3T pants, some 4T PJs. The 4T-5T size fits perfectly.

I even forgot to change him into his night pull-up the other night, and he did awesome!! You mean I might not have to keep buying Goodnights & Super Sposie Pads for PM wear now?!! NICE!

Highly recommend them. He prefers them out of every diaper and pull-up he has… and that’s saying a lot for a sensory kiddo!

I started out with Target brand cuz there diapers were what we were using and happy with. The training pants ran small and weren’t easy to pull on. I just wasn’t a fan.
Then I tried these cuz they were only like 3 cents more (w subscribe and save) and name brand so I figured it was definitely worth a try. And I was right. These are AMAZING! The quality is so good! They are so lightweight and soft. I’m sure they are way more comfortable. The sides have a soft stretchy feel to them instead of a more firmer side with the Velcro like material that most other have. They pull up and down so easily that I know even my son can do it! We’re still working on all of the potty training part.
We haven’t had any leak issues and we also use them at night.
I recently ran out (had my subscribe and save on 5wks which is too much) and tried Pull-Ups brand and they were very similar to the Target brand. They fit a little better but they were stiff and just not as nice as the Pampers EasyUps. It just made me a bigger fan of these. I have it set to once a month now and I will forever use these until my son is putty trained.",positive

200,Baby,"Haakaa Manual Breast Pump 4oz/100ml, New Style",$12.94,5,"Baby #3. I used electric and manual pumps for both other kids. I’ve tried (and still have) Medela, Nuk, and Willow electric pumps with traditional and hands free attachments. I’ve also used Lansinoh and Medela manual pumps. All do what they claim to do but none are ideal for a working mom (which I am).

With my last baby, in particular, I was horribly bothered by how loud ALL of the pumps are (even the manual pumps) because when I’m pumping, it’s because I’m working (i.e., not with baby); not only is the incredibly loud sound of the pump distracting for me, but it makes others uncomfortable and I refuse to pump in a bathroom; it just seems disempowering to do so. With baby #2, I went to a manual pump so I would have more flexibility and discretion and while I loved these attributes of the manual pump, I found that even they make noise and my hand would get sore having to pump so much ... also, again, I’m pumping because I’m working and, maybe I’m uncoordinated, but I found it hard to pump with one hand and work (write or type) with the other OR to have a conversation with someone while also focusing on pumping (insert awkward suction sounds during conversations which were sometimes rhythmic and sometimes not, LOL). All of these distractions led to me missing or minimizing my work pumping sessions and, ultimately, frustration for me and baby when my supply diminished.

I am SO EXCITED to have found this product and I cannot begin to understand why all those apps that promote products for mom and baby don’t include it. This is a MUST HAVE for all mamas and should be in EVERY mama basket at baby showers (it’s ok to have multiple, trust me!!!).

I got the 4oz haaka without the stopper because I was leaking all over myself, especially at night. I figured if I could catch at least one oz per session, I’d have 8oz per day but I couldn’t find those milk catching shields I’ve heard about/seen online anywhere locally. When I started looking for them on Amazon, I came across this little gem and thought it looked interesting ... for $12, it cost less than the shields, could catch more, and looked like an alternative to my preferred manual pump. It turned out to be all that and more!

Not only did I easily catch the extra ounce per sessions, but I immediately noticed an increase in production. In a week, I have started a significant stash and now catch 1-3 oz per session and have 55oz collected and stored (in just a week).

I just started using the haakaa to pump in between night sessions (baby is now sleeping 5-7 hours at night - and my son is only a month old). I believe him getting more hindmilk at each feeding (i.e., from the second breast) is alleviating his gas/upset tummy as well as filling him up completely, which has been stretching his sleep periods. Before the haakaa, he would get too much foremilk too fast then get gassy from all the air he was sucking in at my let down then he would spit up most of his meal when he burped, causing a lot of mess and the need to nurse again shortly thereafter because he was hungry again. It was a frustrating cycle that I’ve suffered through with baby #1 in the past thinking there was no other way; now, I have a tool to help manage it.

I use the haakaa to catch my overflow at each nursing session then finish the session by moving baby to the second breast, which, by then, has been relieved of most of the foremilk and allows him to get more of the filling hindmilk. The result is a combination of reduced gas and increased sleep, which has already made life better for both of us!

A couple things for moms trying this for the first time:

- It IS different than anything you’ve tried before. Be patient with yourself! You’ll get it. Try it during the day at first so you can see what you are doing when your mind is clear and can focus (and awake!!!).

- If you want to use it as a catch system during nursing, don’t stress about the suction level, it’s easy to simply squeeze the bottom and attach - that’s enough suction to catch the let down.

- If you want it to actually “pump,” then you need to follow the instructions by bending back the top, aligning your nipple with the small neck opening, squeeze the bottom, and attach. I’ve noticed that the release/pumping action actually happens about 45 seconds after attaching it when the bottom is almost fully open; after that happens, squeeze again and wait for the next release. It usually takes me 4 squeezes to completely fill the “4oz” haaka. I also recommend paying attention to the weight of the unit when pumping; as it fills up, you need to monitor the suction and the volume to avoid it falling off OR you squeezing a full haakaa and dumping it out on accident.

- The 4oz haaka is NOT 4oz, it’s 100mL, which is 3.3 oz. Personally, I don’t care that the measurements are off, I just care that I’m getting the milk! I use bottles to measure my supply anyway.

- Pay attention as your milk supply increases ... you’ll be surprised how fast you can pump or let down 3.5oz and have a mess on your hands when the haakaa itself overflows!!! Because of this, I’m ordering the 5oz/150mL version with the flower stopper. I will still use the 4oz during the day until my supply increases to the point that I need the 5oz all the time. Then I’ll probably get a second 5oz just so I can let the haakaa fully air dry between uses (saves a step of having to towel dry it ... maybe I’m lazy, or maybe I have three kids, or maybe I’m finally getting a handle on this mom thing?).

- Tip: I have bottles that I use to pour the milk into after each haaka session; when the bottles get to 4oz, I transfer the milk to bags. This allows me to be sure I have 4oz in each bag and for all my bags to be uniform in quantity, which will make it easier to prepare bottles down the road.

- Tip: if you are fortunate enough to get one of these (or use ANY pump) during the early days when you are still producing that beautiful golden colostrum milk, consider freezing THAT milk in 1oz cubes or bags so you can add that liquid gold to your more mature milk down the road ... this will give your baby powerful nutrition at 2+ months old that they normally would not get at that age.

- Tip: use the haakaa after nursing on each breast to stimulate additional milk production. You may not get more milk that session, but it tells your body you need to make more - and it will!

- You may find that you want to also use a classic electric pump to get that deep release when you are away from baby for longer periods ... be gentle to yourself and don’t put stress on you to do things a certain way. It’s fine to use two (or three or four) different products to make sure you have the support you need. Any method that gets milk to your baby is a good method and any tool that helps you do that is a good tool. Try different things until you find the ones that work best for you.

- Tip: enjoy this time with your baby; it doesn’t last long. 💙",positive
201,Baby,"Haakaa Manual Breast Pump 4oz/100ml, New Style",$12.94,5,"I got haakaa based on all good reviews I read, about 2 months before my baby was born. My baby is about 2 months and I feel I can give my honest review.
Pros:
-price: haaka is afordable option, and it's well worth the money invested
-easy cleaning: washing it with soap and water or sterilizing it; both very easy
-fairly simple and easy to use: there is learning curve, but after few times I feel like it became second nature
-good for catching let down: I don't have any milk leaking, I don't need to wear pads, I just never leak. I was skeptical that haakaa would work for me, but after few attempts, I am constantly able to get 1 to 2 oz on opposite side. My baby feeds on one side and usually does not want other breast, I place haakaa on a side my baby is not feeding and that's it. After baby is done eating I remove hakka and there is is 1-2oz (couple times I got 3-4).

Cons:
-name: haakaa is labeled as breast pump, but this is not a breast pump; haakaa is more of suction driven milk receptacle. If you are looking for a pump, haakaa is not it.
-spill potential: baby can kick it off, it can accidentally fall of if sudden unexpected movement happens; its not stable if placed on table or any surface. All these can be fixed with awareness and simple hacks, like breastfeeding in football hold, having a bag or bottle to transfer milk when milk collection is done etc; accepting that spills can happen etc..

All in all it's well worth the money, I enjoy collecting milk more then I enjoy pumping, and it requires no extra time (happens simultaneously with breastfeeding). Most importantly it works even for people with no leaking , and it works for large breastfeeding.",positive
202,Baby,"Haakaa Manual Breast Pump 4oz/100ml, New Style",$12.94,5,"Saw an ad for this on pinterest and I looked it up because I HATE pumping. It's incredibly painful for me and I figured anything is better than the pump.

Pro tip: it takes a minute or two for milk to start flowing. Once it does, you're golden.

My baby only nurses on one side at night before going back to sleep and I wake with a soaked shirt every morning. A few minutes with this baby and I'm not nearly as engorged and my shirt stays significantly drier. My chest doesn't hurt as much either!

I look forward to using this to encourage my body to produce more by attaching it after feeding sessions.",positive
203,Baby,"Haakaa Manual Breast Pump 4oz/100ml, New Style",$12.94,5,"I think this item is an absolute must have for milking mommies. I say milking instead because it is great for moms who breast feed and pump.

For breast feeding, I like to keep this in my other nipple to catch any fallout. If baby needs a break I will stick it on both sides until they're ready for more. Whatever baby doesn't eat, I properly store for another feeding or freeze.

For breast pumping mommas, I think this is great for those experiencing mastitis. What I will do is add an ounce or 2 of hot water and bath salt in the pump, suction it to my boobs and it loosens my ducts. This is just something you can't do with a mechanical pump.

I will say however, this is not the easiest thing to use. It doesn't fall off all the time, but it does require some coordination to stay on. It can be knocked off, which can be frustrating, so I always stay aware of potential accidents.",positive

If you breastfeed you want lace this on the opposite breast for the let down. Saves a lot of milk!! There are other sizes which I would recommend cuz the 4 oz one fills up fast.

It's light weight so you can even travel with it. I've used it so many places and times. It's awesome for those with an over active supply, still regulating milk, or even with a heavy letdown. It's also a manual pump so great for on the go pumping or for times when it's not super convenient to pump or don't have access to plug in a pump. It's cheaper than an electric pump but was nearly as effective for me! I collected hundreds of ounces in these.
I would recommend buying 2 - so you always have a clean one. I also kept one in each place I would feed baby to collet milk on the side I wasn't nursing. Multiple times I also used both at the same time for pumping, including while riding in the car.
This particular purchase was for a baby shower gift.",positive
206,Baby,"Haakaa Manual Breast Pump 4oz/100ml, New Style",$12.94,5,"Let me tell ya about the best invention ever: the haaka! These are silicone breast pumps that you stick on and forget and they do all the work. I have been using a haaka on the opposite side while feeding baby since we came home from the hospital and it is a game changer! Because they have suction they take out more than just letdown and convince your body you need to make more milk, breastfeeding is supply and demand after all. With these I have consistently put away 24oz extra ounces every day on top of nursing baby with almost no traditional pumping! I hit 10 gallons in my freezer stash this morning🤯 I had a little bit of surplus with my first but this is nuts and I cannot recommend enough.

Picture of my early morning haaka use, I have 2 because makes washing easier and baby sleeps for a long time and the early morning milk surplus is real.

*disclaimer to add: there are downsides to oversupply if you are not fully emptying your breast: clugs, mastitis, constantly buying freezer bags, running out of freezer space🤪 Personally, the stress of returning to work with my last breastfeeding journey hurt my supply and then the stress of running out hindered it even more.

Has a good suction, too good I'd say. If not placed correctly, it does hurt like a pinch. But just be mindful of placement and you'll be good. Hands free once placed. If done correctly it stays in place. Slowly, but surely collects milk from any let downs. Easy to clean. No need to disassemble. It's all one item.

Also, super convenient don't need a whole setup. And, much easier to do while nursing since not attached to any wires. This morning I grabbed it and put it on to see what it could do and and didn't think I was going to get more than a few drops.

I do like that you can put as much or as little suction as you need or want, however there is definitely a learning curve at first. Angling the nipple correctly, folding down the upper part of the flange, and making sure everything is centered. Maybe it’s the universal size that just doesn’t work for me as I’m on the smaller end.

210,Baby,Diapers Size 3,$53.37 - $152.60,5,"Does your baby roll, squirm, and try to crawl or wriggle away when you try to change him or her? Have you tried giving baby your keys, phone, TV remote, lotion bottle, or absolutely anything else she shouldn't have just to try to distract her during a change?

Can you tell I've been there??

I used to dread changing our little one's diaper. She saw it either as a chance to play a game and be all silly, rolling away and laughing, or she protested being laid down at all. There's only so many songs, finger plays, forbidden objects within reach, etc that you can do or grab while getting through a diaper change and at a certain point they all just quit working.

Enter the best baby product ever: Pampers Cruisers 360 Fit diapers. Diaper changes are SO EASY now!

Here's how to make a change fast and easy for your little one:

Have your kiddo stand in front of you and together put the new diaper on. The old one is still on at this time. Pull the new diaper up to just about your baby/toddler's knees. Then, undo the edges of the old diaper, pull it out from between kiddo's legs, and pull the new one right up. Voila! It takes less than 10 seconds. Super, duper easy!!

My girl doesn't fight diaper changes anymore. In fact, she was running around last night playing a mini game and bringing me diapers one by one and asking me to put them on her, stacking them on top of each other. Toddlers🤷🏻‍♀️😂 Because these diapers can also pull off and not just be removed by breaking the edges, we didn't waste any diapers and my daughter had a grand old time.

These diapers are not just super convenient, they're also super absorbent. We have never had a leak with these. We even replaced our overnight diapers and just use these now. Our daughter used to nurse all night long so her diaper was pretty full in the morning, and she never once had a leak... unlike that other brand with cool prints that seemed to leak Every. Single. Night. ""Hello"" diaper brand over there. You know which one I mean!

Another plus for these is the soft leg openings. Sometimes on the tab diapers, the tab section is a little rough and can rub against the thighs of a baby who is crawling or running around. This does not happen with the Pampers Cruisers 360 Fit!

I highly recommend you give these a try. If you have an alligator baby who wants to roll away for fun, if you have a baby who is just really not into diaper changes right now and thinks they're the worst thing in the world, even if you have a baby who is easy to change their diaper but who has sensitive skin and you want something you know is soft and gentle... these are for you. They are absorbent, comfy, and a lifesaver for changes.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention! Once I quit trying to make my daughter lie down for every change, she willingly lies down for ""dirty"" diaper changes now. Often all I need to do is tell her we need to change her p**py diaper and she goes to her changing mat and lies down herself!

These diapers have made a world of difference. I tell all my mommy friends about them and have even shared some of our own diapers with people, knowing if they tried them then they would be hooked.

Highly, highly recommend!",positive

It is easy for them to hold on their tummy or back as they roll around. They suck on the wings and chew on the feet. Neither of them will take a pacifier so this really comes in handy for soothing them. And they can hold it really easily without even putting their hand inside it.

My biggest dislike about the product is that it gets so dirty and it’s hard to clean due to the silicone material.

I ordered this and another brand similar to this one as a last ditch effort before spending more money on different, more expensive pacifiers. And it’s been a wonder. Baby can control it, she can suck on it or chew on it. If she hits herself in the face, it doesn’t startle her or frustrate her because it’s soft and round. It’s shaped like a nipple but not so much that baby is confused. Not sure if we will let her continue to use it when she has teeth, based on other reviews and an excess of caution.",positive

One of the biggest reasons i love pampers over all others is because its the only brand that doesnt puff up like a balloon. Any leaking I ever had with these diapers were due to sizing; usually how I know im pushing them to their limit and need to go up a size. They last through the night and even longer if necessary.

So many were weird shapes and had unnecessary or even detrimental features, with manufacturers seeming to try too hard to make their toys stand out. I just wanted... something simple... that tiny hands could hold. This is not a rattle, but this is the perfect toy for a baby looking for anything he can drool on. It's brightly colored, and the long giraffe neck fits in his hands perfectly. Baby happily slobbers on the feet and the head, and it's a good size that he'll still be able to enjoy as he grows.

So if you are testing accuracy against a good oral thermometer, they will not match and they really shouldn’t. Different parts of the body have different levels of temp accuracy and require a tiny bit of math.

I tested this on myself against our trusty oral thermometer. Every single time, at varying distances within the mentioned range (from straight up just placed on my forehead to the 3cm limit) and got 97.5 to 97.7 each time. My oral thermometer was placing me at 98.6 to 98.7.

The Mederos material is too stiff and difficult to pour milk into. It also does not zip closed as easily. The material also makes me a bit paranoid as it is so stiff that I sometimes wonder if the bag would tear if it was knocked slightly.
