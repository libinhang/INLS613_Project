0,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with latest Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), Dolby Vision",$29.99,1,"DO NOT BUY FIRE TV DEVICES!!! CHOOSE ANOTHER STREAMING PLAYER BRAND!!!
Worst customer service experience in my life from Amazon!!!! Amazon sent me a completely broken Fire TV 4k stick! From day one the audio cuts out entirely after a few mins of playing a video, and does not return until stick is physically unplugged from power. Then it cuts out again. Problem occurs in all video apps, and I tried full software restore, plugging into multiple different TVs, as well as different audio connections (direct to TV through HDMI, Through receiver, through bluetooth on multiple devices.) And my other Fire TV 4k of the same model works fine in this same TV, so... THE STICK IS BROKEN! So I contact Amazon through their chat interface and Parmish is a total disaster at helping me. I tell him that I have done a full software restore on it, at which point he responds that I need to do a full software restore. Ya know, the thing I just told him that I did already. Then I tell him I have already tried plugging the fire TV directly into the TV with no sound receiver, and he says ""well than what I need you to do is plug the fire TV directly into the TV with no sound receiver."" This happened over and over. It was like a bad joke. But I wasn't laughing. Finally after about an hour of this nonsense he decides that my Fire TV stick needs to be replaced. Then he says I ""Have no card on file"", what ever that means. So after about 10 more unanswered and ignored questions to him about just what he's talking about I finally figure out he means my Amazon account has no credit card on file. But it does have a card on file. I log in and verify this. The card is up to date and working, and amazon had just charged it that day even. So I tell him this, and he responds that I need a credit card on file in order to send out a replacement, even though it won't be charged. I tell him again that the card is on file and working, and he says it need to be updated. Even though it does not. So I hit ""edit"" on my card info on file, and resubmit the same working card. Parmish sees this on his end and says thank you. Then he says I need to update my OTHER CARD on file. I look and there is an old credit card from 6 years ago on the account from a bank I no longer use, and its not even selected as the active/favored card, so It doesn't even matter that it there, but I delete it anyways just to be sure. Then Parmish says I need to reenter and update that old card (that I no longer bank with) in order to get a replacement sent out. At this point I'm done with Parmish. The whole conversation was absolutely ridiculous! I say ""thank you for the help but I need a supervisor. Please transfer me to a supervisor.""

So Parmish transfers me to Vikas. I ask Vikas if he is a supervisor and he says ""no."" (Are you surprised by this? I wasn't.) So I explain that I was suppose to be transferred to a supervisor and ask that Vikas transfer me directly to a supervisor. And I'm transferred to Annal.

I ask Annal if they are a supervisor, and they answer... get ready for it... are you ready... they answer ...""No"" !!!!!!!!! They &^^&%&$^^%^ answer ""No.""

So I close the chat window I just wasted over an hour on and I call Amazon. This is where the real nightmare begins. I start off with a regular customer service rep and I ask her to transfer me to a supervisor right away because this will be my 4th attempt to get a supervisor. She is very polite and gets me a supervisor on the line write away. I explain the entire issue with the Fire Tv 4k Stick and everything I have done to troubleshoot it already YET AGIAN, and the supervisor apologizes for all the insane trouble I've been having. She sounds like she really wants to help me, asked some more questions, and then tells me that she can't replace this particular model because its out of stock. I had just checked the stock, so I knew it wasn't out. I checked it again, and then told her it appears to have plenty of stock. She verified what model it was again, then said ""oh yes, I guess we do have it, let my put you on hold while I try to send you one."" She comes back a while later and says ""the system won't let me send you one. I have to transfer you to a Fire TV Specialist, buy I'll get you a manager there as well.

So then I have to go through the whole thing again with this new Fire TV Specialist person. She keeps putting me on hold to check things over and over again. And she has me do crazy things - For example, she insists I go to my TV, unplug the other working Fire TV I now have in there, and plug this broken one back in, then load it up and read the serial number off of it to her from the info screen. Why? Doesn't she already have that info? She should. And WHY AM I PLUGGING A $25 DEFECTIVE BROKEN DEVICE BACK INTO MY $2,000 FLATSCREEN??!!! I don't want to do that. I shouldn't be asked to do that. What the hell? Then she keeps checking to see if I'm still in warranty. REALL???!!! I JUST got this stick in the mail. I JUST GOT IT. How long is the warranty period that she has to keep checking on.. 5 hours after purchase. Also, this is a brand new model that just came out. HOW COULD ANY OF THEM POSSIBLY BE OUT OF WARRANTY??!!

Finally after 3 HOURS of talking to people about this and a final, particularly long hold while the Fire TV Specialist person tries to figure out if I can be sent a replacement - I give up. I tell her I'll just return it instead - just so I can just get off the phone. But I'm NOT returning it - That too would probably turn into another huge nightmare. It's not worth my $25 for all this aggravation. So... I'M DONE. This is ridiculous! After speaking with a total of SIX people for over THREE HOURS.. My brand new Fire TV 4K stick in now in my trash can and I'm never buying a Fire TV product again. All Amazon need to do was have me send in my broken one and then send out a replacement. That's It. They could have sorted out all their serial numbers and insane data requirements after they got my stick back. AS a customer, I simply got something in the mail that arrived broken and I wanted it replaced soon after I got it. How simple of a transition is that? But instead I got this torrent of poor customer service and bizarre data mining. SO.. Officially.. I'm no longer a Fire TV user.

I'm currently switching my entire smart TV ecosystem for the entire house over to Google's Android TV now, I've had it with Fire TV, and I suggest you do the same. Android TV systems don't suffer from the same app limitations that Amazon does (IE with Fire TV you get access got about 12% of the Android apps available to the rest of the Android TV world, Even though Fire TV runs on Android, and you can install what ever apps you want on your Android TV device without having to TRICK IT into installing it), it still works and runs apps (like playing a game or looking at photos) even if your internet connection goes down (Fire TV becomes a useless brick without constant internet), and the whole thing just seems to run better. I don't have time to deal with Amazon's nightmare anymore. All I needed was for Amazon to replace the broken Fire TV stick they JUST sent me, and they can't even do that. So, ummmm... BYEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!",negative
1,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with latest Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), Dolby Vision",$29.99,5,"After years of frustration with Roku devices, including the integrated Roku TVs (I own 3 of them), I finally decided I'd had enough. It seemed that I was constantly fighting to even get the remote to work properly, even with new batteries. The streaming quality wasn't good, often freezing, and having to cold reboot the system often. In addition, the menu structure for Roku is awful.

Enough of the old, one with the new!

Because I've been so pleased with my first Fire TV 4K Stick for almost a year, I purchased another and finally tossed the Roku Stick on my plasma TV. The Fire TV 4K Stick provides pretty much everything I ever wanted in a simple and easy to use device that's intuitive, has a great menu system, includes Alexa and other voice controls, and controls my TV! That last part cannot be emphasized enough, not having to switch back and forth between remotes is so nice.

Even though my TVs aren't 4K, I figured the enhanced capabilities would help the streaming quality, and I'm very happy with it's performance. Now, the menu is loaded instantly when I power up the TVs, so very different than the experience with Roku.

If you're trying to decide which TV Stick to purchase, I feel you can't go wrong with the Fire TV 4K Stick, it's absolutely everything all TV Sticks ought to provide, at a price that's very competitive. The reliability of the first one I purchased has been excellent after a year, and I expect both to continue to work well. I may have to buy two more for the other TVs in the home to completely purge Roku!",positive
2,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with latest Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), Dolby Vision",$29.99,5,"I didn’t believe there could be any other good streaming device besides Apple TV, UNTIL I installed a Fire-stick. I’ve had this fire stick since a Black Friday about three years ago. I think they ran it on special for $10-$20. When it came I stuck it the bedroom entertainment center, planning to install it SOMETIME. Well even good things can die. My Apple TV did. 💔 well to buy new ones I think they are well over $100, so I said hmph! I’ll try the Stick. Wow, I had unboxed, read the directions, I had it plugged in and running in a half an hour. And I’m a non-tech savvy 77 year old! I immediately ordered another stick for the family room TV. I am a believer! Oh yeah, I ordered the new one last night, and it just delivered! Gotta love Amazon Prime.",positive
3,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with latest Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), Dolby Vision",$29.99,5,"I ordered a 2nd Firestick as we switched to YouTubeTV and the reception was horrible in the Man Cave. When I got it I noticed that the envelope it came in was a bit abused as well ass the box the Firestick came in. Well, I hooked it all up and everything WORKED! Then I went to bed and the next day woke up to find out NOTHING was working!!! So, after screwing around for an hour I googled ""Firestick controller not responding"" and followed the instructions from several sites. I finally just reset the stick to ""factory settings"" and it worked again! YAY! Well, the next day I woke up to find it was worse than before and the remote wouldn't do anything. So, I called AMAZON and they sent me out a replacement the SAME DAY!!! This one arrived with no apparent damage so I hooked it up and got it going. Had to get PRIME / YOUTUBE / YOUTUBETV / NETFLIX / HULU all working from the Firestick remote - and I did! Having all this and voice recognition from ONE controller was amazing - too good to believe. Well, I went to bed in great trepidation but the next day everything was WORKING!!!! I can't explain the JOY in my heart that happened after being so freaking MAD the prior one was faulty. I'm 70 and the TV is my main source of life enjoyment and now everything was flowing effortlessly. AMAZON really came through and turned my anger into pure JOY with one controller that does everything. So------- I guess I am writing this to say if you get one that doesn't work CALL AMAZON (the phone number is right on the work order) and they will set you right. I always think it's ME when something goes wrong but in this case it WAS the Stick!",positive
4,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with latest Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), Dolby Vision",$29.99,5,"I've had Amazon Prime for many years now and could never understand why anyone needed a firestick. However, recently a family member gave us a rather nice, used tv that was excess to their needs and so I began exploring cost effective ways to set it up without paying for additional boxes or subscriptions. I don't know if the price has come down, but I was amazed at how inexpensive it is to purchase a firestick. So, I took a chance and ordered one. I'm an old fart and not particularly savvy on new tech, but I was able to easily set up our new, used tv to receive all of our many subscription channels, as well as our regular television channels (by downloading the 'Anywhere' App.) Additionally, the remote that came with the tv had gotten misplaced, but was no longer even needed, because the remote that came with the firestick synced flawlessly and does it all. It even has voice control that allows one to simply say what you want to watch and 'voila' it is available. Best of all, this feature does not require that I address a non-sentient, critter-assistant, named A...a, preparatory to using voice commands. Another amazing benefit is, that other than an HDMI port on the tv, a two socket electrical wall outlet was all that was needed to hook this puppy up; no unsightly, visible cables or cords aesthetically bumming me out. Again, the tv and firestick worked seamlessly together to get up and running with minimal brain cell calories expended. Easy-peasy!",positive
5,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with latest Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), Dolby Vision",$29.99,5,"We were totally sick of paying 100 plus dollars a month for cable TV for years. I was very skeptical about these new steaming sticks. We had the FireStick on sale at work for 39 dollars and I had an employee discount so I said what the hell and bought one. I love it! Super easy to install. Plug it in and do what it tells you. Could not be easier and it worked. You download a bunch of Apps and then you have access to a massive amount of free movies and television shows. I was totally surprised. You do have to have an Amazon account which if you order anything from Amazon you should have anyway. I also have really good internet service from Xfinity and haven't seen any problems with shows lagging or buffering. I don't know how a slow internet will work with this. The Alexa button is pretty neat also. She actually listens and makes an attempt to do what you ask. Also all kinds of news channels, even a local news app. The non liberal news channels are available which is a requirement for me. One thing I noticed is whenever you download a free app you get a bill statement for zero dollars from Amazon. I always find statements that look like bills to be frightening. However everything has been totally free and they make it clear if it isn't. In conclusion, I would say there is a definite learning curve but this thing is 100 million times better than cable and 100 million times cheaper. I totally recommend it. The only thing you need to investigate is how good does your internet need to be. Great job by Amazon!",positive
6,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with latest Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), Dolby Vision",$29.99,5,"Bought the 4K Firestick, got it set up, and it worked great. About six hours later, it quit working. Dark screen. Brought the Firestick in from our bedroom, worked fine. Took the new Firestick and plugged it into the bedroom, nothing. Resets didn't work, replaced batteries, still nothing. So got a replacement Firestick and Remote. All has been good. Until today, 2 months 2 days later. Watching TV, and went to fast forward thru a commercial, nothing happens. Can't change channel, can't change volume, can't turn off the TV. Nothing. Brought in Firestick from bedroom again, works great. Took other Firestick and remote into the bedroom, nothing. So not have to order a new remote. I guess the ""better prices"" nowadays mean we get items that don't work as well? I'd rather pay more and get something that lasts more than three months.",positive

The Firestick was easy to hook up but I did have a problem getting it to pair with the remote, but it finally did. I'm impressed with the quality of the Firestick the colors are nice and bright. The remote is super responsive and there are a ton of options and apps. It did take a bit for me to find out where all the apps are located as the interface is much different from Roku's. The Firestick was easy to add to my amazon account. Overall I'm happy and impressed with the Firestick.",positive
8,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with latest Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), Dolby Vision",$29.99,5,Came exactly like stated. Box was not damaged and product was perfect. I have use cromecast and Roku before and over time has to replace devices. But this is my 2nd fire stick to replace the Roku on my 2nd tv. First one I’ve had for years and is still going strong. Amazon fire has the best quality above the other services. Connection is a whole lot stronger and more realiable then Roku depending on what kind of Wi-Fi you use as some types of Wi-Fi devices Roku has trouble connecting to. Fire stick Has no issues at all,positive
9,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with latest Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), Dolby Vision",$29.99,4,"Once I got this working, then it works great. The instructions tell you to use the supplied power adapter and cable and I was indeed able to get it working that way. However, if you want to use a longer HDMI cable, you also have to buy an HDMI coupler female to female. However, using a longer HDMI cable resulted in the TV complaining of a weak signal and not showing a picture.

When I tried using this Fire tv stick with the Amazon Ethernet Adapter for Amazon Fire TV Devices, the stick kept re-booting and would never finish the boot sequence. All the advice online says to use the supplied Amazon power adapter and cable. However that advice is wrong.

My problem was solved when I replaced the Amazon power adapter with a 1.5 A power adapter (can't read the specs on the Amazon power adapter but suspect that it is lower than that). Now, the fire tv stick and ethernet adapter work flawlessly. I can use any length HDMI cable I want.

So, if you are having problems, my advice is to replace the Amazon power adapter. I would have given 5 stars if Amazon had included a better power adapter. I would have given 6 stars if they had included a HDMI female to female coupler.",positive
10,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,3,"I appreciate that I got this at a very good Prime Day price. I now have 3 Fire Sticks and am grateful to have them. This generation seems to work faster than the previous as well -- scrolls faster, responds faster. I don't generally use voice, because the previous version was horrid to even attempt, so I gave up long ago.

Now here's the rub. AMAZON, YOUR NEW FIRE STICK DESIGN IS A FAILURE. Here's why:

The new remote is great for those who never used the previous remote. The previous was more streamlined which made it easy to locate buttons without even glancing at it. The previous had fewer buttons so there was little confusion as to what you were pressing at any given time. The batteries were near the bottom of the remote which is where the bulk of the weight would rest perfectly in the palm of your hand.

The NEW remote is the opposite of all of the above. First, there is no way I can find the play/pause button on this remote unless I physically look down at it. Even then, it's smack dab in the middle of a square of NINE buttons, plus 5 more. The mute and live TV buttons are placed so that it's easy to feel for them without having to stop to look at the remote (there is blank space below both). I am often pressing the wrong button when trying to play/pause. Yes, I could click the large round Select button at the top, but if on YouTube, it takes two clicks to pause, and the screen menu appears on the screen which takes yet another click to remove. All this means extra clicks (wear and tear) on the remote, extra battery power, and is a general annoyance.

Now about the battery.. the batteries on the new remote are at the top which puts the bulk of the weight opposite of where most people hold the remote -- either in the palm or with the fingers. I have dropped this thing numerous times already because it feels unbalanced and top-heavy. It is unnatural for the way we're used to most remote controls. In addition, because I still have two other Fire Sticks with remotes that I still use, it is difficult to retrain my hands to use this clumsy, awkward stepchild of a remote just for this one device.

Lastly, the new buttons for streaming services are nice to have, but not the greatest to have. If you truly have -- and USE -- all 4 services, this remote is made for you. Anything less than 2 or 3, and it's just another device with useless functions. While I appreciate being able to single-click to Hulu, I would much rather go through the main menu and get rid of these excess buttons. PLUS, most remotes have a different colored Power button at the top. Between the fact that these buttons being at the bottom + the awkward weight distribution of the remote, I frequently mistakenly hold this remote the wrong way and end up clicking incorrect buttons. I'm watching a video on YouTube, and with one errant click, I'm in that wild maze of a Live TV menu, wonder where I went wrong in life.

AMAZON, HERE'S WHAT TO DO TO IMPROVE THIS REMOTE:
1. Move the batteries back to the bottom right at the area where most people hold the lower half of the remote in their palm. 2. Move the streaming buttons to the top of the remote. 3. Move the mute, volume up, volume down, and Live TV buttons down into a separate section AWAY from the navigational buttons. Leave blank space below the rewind, play/pause, and forward buttons so we can again find these buttons without having to turn on lights and look down at the remote. 4. A more complete transfer of previous Fire Stick data to the new Fire Stick would be appreciated -- my transfer of data was incomplete. Why not allow a simply one-time cloning of apps via Amazon AWS so we don't have to spend an hour reinstalling apps we're used to?

Until then, I'd like my money back or an exchange of this Fire Stick for an older generation like the other two I have. 1 star for the price, 1 star for the volume control, 1 star for speed. I'd take off more stars for the annoyances, however.",fair
11,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"This is my 3rd Fire TV Stick with TV controls. They have all been the newest generation. Without having owned any previous generations I can not attest to the increase in processing power or the speed that apps load compared to the last generation but, it claims to be a 50% increase and I would have to assume that is correct. It is fast from waking it up after it puts itself to sleep or even doing the occasional system reboot. It’s maybe 30seconds for the latter and lightning fast for waking.
If you have an Amazon Prime Account, select that you would like it synced to your account so when you get it, it will have your Prime Video, Amazon Music, And all your smart devices including any Echo devices you have in your household that your current devices have already discovered. So after you plug it in you can almost immediately start watching, listening and using the Alexa Voice bottom located at the top of the remote to initiate either plus control your devices.
For TV power and volume control, please follow the set up. It starts you off with the set up of your TV and you will having it ready to use as your new TV remote for use when enjoying any of your steaming services. Connecting you new Fire TV Stick with TV controls is easier than you would think. Just follow “quick set-up guide in the box. If you are have trouble call customer service to help and guide you through the process.
Pictured are a completely emptied box of all contents that comes with your purchase and you will be amazed at how expertly packaged all those items are in the box. Amazon has minimized waste and uses recycled packaging and there is minimal plastic use. Also, all Amazon devices can be traded in when buying a newer generation where Amazon will give you a discount toward the new old and recycle or renew your old device. It’s a win-win! For the greatest discount, wait until you see the newer device at its lowest price. I’ve noticed it usually about every three months or so they will have a steep discount. So trade in and upgrade with the discount you get for recycling.
I’m using my newest Fire TV Stick w TV controls (pictured in the 1st and 2nd photos) in my bedroom connected to a mini projector that I have pointing up to my ceiling. I purchased an RCA projector from Woot for less than $40 and it included (2) HDMI ports, a micro SD card slot, Bluetooth, VGA and has an incredible bright and large picture that I can watch laying in bed and just looking up. As you can see on this newer generation they have included some shortcuts they I have found perfectly suit my needs. I subscribe to almost every streaming service available out there and these four are by far my favorites. My projector does a max 1080p resolution and this Fire TV Stick delivers that full HD content. The Fire TV Stick with TV control has a very intuitive remote and is easy to use. The only critiques I would give are pretty sever, the remote is hard to find if you misplace it (but a bright colorful silicone case. They sell them on here for under $10), speaking of losing the remote, it’s not a bargain to replace the remote. (In most cases, just buying a brand new Fire TV Stick with TV controls is cheaper), lastly, the remote only has one red dot LED that lights up for a limited number of functions, no buttons light up at all on the remote. It makes for the utmost difficulty if your watching a dark movie and want to use the remote at all. Those three things are clearly a negative but, if you can accept those conditions/flaws than you won’t be disappointed in anything else. If I had to design a remote for this, all buttons would be backlit, there would be a “find function button on the Fire Stick itself (the part plugged into the back of your TV) that would send a Bluetooth signal to illuminate the keys with a quick flashing and an audible sound to locate (interesting fact, your Fire TV Stick with TV controls’s remote is Bluetooth, so no pointing at ur TV, it works in any direction. Even when the TV is not in your line of sight). And lastly, hopefully the remote can always be found but, if not there should be a discounted price for a new remote.",positive
12,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"My Old Apple TV would not support YouTube streaming and so I went shopping for a new one till I saw they were $150. Went to Amazon to price other devices and the Fire Stick was on sale for like 15 bucks so I gave it a try.
This was a great purchase. The Fire Stick integrates with all my other Alexa devices and I can control my TV and streaming channels via Alexa Voice commands as well as view my Ring Doorbell Camera. The Streaming Service Apps for Netflix, Hulu, Prime, YouTube, etc etc etc work great. And there are other online free channels that I didn't even know existed.
It even comes with a remote that accepts voice commands and will control most of the functions on my Insignia TV and Likewise the Insignia TV remote can control the Fire Stick via the HDMI connection.
The only drawback for me is it doesn't support Apple's Airplay for mirroring my iPhone/iPads to the TV although there are some third party apps for the Fire TV to allow Apple Device Mirroring.

The Fire TV Stick IMO is better than my Apple TV (circa 2014) and Roku devices and is less inexpensive.",positive
13,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"***EDIT 05/31/2021 - READ WAY BELOW! AMAZON FIRESTICK 3RD GEN BEATS OUT NVIDIA SHIELD, CHROMECAST 3RD GEN AND ROKU****

I REALLY LOVE THIS NEW DEVICE! IT IS FAST, I CAN STREAM MY OWN MOVIE APPS (CARTOON HD, TYPHOON, SYNCLAIR, FILM PLUS, NOVA, KODI, CINEMA HD) AMAZINGLY FAST!

Netflix and prime is super fast also!!! I AM GOING TO ORDER 4 MORE!! AMAZON FIRESTICK BEATS OUT APPLE TV AND CHROMCAST GOOGLE TV!!!!

Edit 05/03/2021: 4 days of heavy usage (horror movie marathon) and no rebooting, and the firestick has yet to lag or become slow. I switched from wireless to Ethernet and same thing: no issues at all. Absolutely a fantastic device!!!

Edit 05/10/2021: posting a weekly update.

This device is even more amazing than I first noted. I have yet to experience any slowness or lag. I use it approximately 3 to 6 hours a day, sometimes over 6 hours. I use it for the Live tv option, and of course for YouTube, and audible, I am definitely not seeing any lag it is very speedy. With my 4k, at least once a week I had to unplug and plug it back in. NOT THIS 3RD GEN!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET THIS PURCHASE!

A bit of advice on two things:

First, the 4k firetick, while amazing as it is, is running Android 7.1, which can explain the lag between apps.

The 3rd gen runs Android 9.0, which explains the speed increase and better memory management, not to mention more secure (Firesticks are super secure, just my opinion on Android from a full time Android user). Hence, it is a better idea to get the 3rd gen.

Second, I change frequently from WiFi to Ethernet, to continue testing lagging and I have still experienced absolutely no lag. Ethernet connects at 150 Mbps, will not go higher, where as WiFi is 540 Mbps which tells me the Firesticks are made for WiFi, which makes sense however I love the Ethernet option because I have a cable available.

All I can say is, the Firestick outbeats every streaming device out there (except maybe the Nvidia shield) with reliability, speed, ease of use, connectivity. YOU ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT REGRET YOUR PURCHASE!!!!

EDIT 05/19: I started experiencing lagging issues, and had to unplug and restart the Firestick, first time in 30 days! Was hoping to make it to 45 days but 30 days, with 5 to 7 hours a day of use is pretty amazing!!

I made an error earlier on Ethernet speed with Amazon's Ethernet adapter. The Ethernet adapter from Amazon clocks at 150 Mbps, so I bought Cable Matters Micro USB to Ethernet Adapter and .. WOW! I connect at 349 down and almost 40 up!! I have absolutely no internet lag, on or off wifi but I always prefer Ethernet when I can use it.

I managed to download and install a total of 12 applications via filelinked, and I still have 1.99 gb of space available. This firetick continues to amaze me!!!

Firestick once again beats out Roku, Google Chromecast Android tv, apple tv, except the Nvidia shield. You will not regret this purchase!

Edit 05/31/2021:

I decided to purchase a Nvidia shield pro, so that I could compare and because I got a lot of messages stating it is the best on the market.

It was ana amazing setup, the device is powerful, and snappy. I compared it with the 3rd gen stick and the only three differences I noticed was the following:

More memory; shield has 3gb vs 3rd gen having 2gb
Space; shield has 12gb, can be expanded to 1tb. Firestick has 8, expandable to 512gb.
Screen; 4k is absolutely amazing. 3rd gen has 1080.

Compared with he 4k firestick, the screen is the same.

Speed is the same between shield and firesticks, and navigation is as silky smooth HOWEVER, I am noticing via Hulu, Netflix and Disney plus on shield, the voice was not matching up to the characters when watching movies and shows. No matter what I did: uninstall, reinstall all three apps, shut down and restarted numerous times. It is really annoying and does defeat the entirety of the device as a streaming device.

Price; Nvidia shield is $199, 2019 model with Android 9, April security...Chromecast Android tv is Android 10 with may security patch..at $49.99, 2020 model.... 3rd gen is $39.99 and prime day you can probably get it for $24.99..for a 2021 model. I will not rate Roku because you cannot sideload apps, and it is limited like apple streaming.

Winner?

AMAZON!!! AMAZON IS THE ABSOLUTE WINNER!

For price, security patches, navigation, side installing apps, ease of use... COME ON FOLKS! I DEBUNKED THE NVIDIA SHIELD MYTH!! I also am returning the shield because I cannot keep something that cannot handle streaming.

Note: Nvidia shield is amazing for gaming, and absolutely beats out all streaming devices. This is just streaming applications that I have reviewed and an issue with!",positive
14,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"I have no complaint with the ease of ordering or the price or delivery.

But FireStick has frustrated me from the beginning. Alexa rarely understands my requests and I have a Midwestern accent so not very unique. When I request PBS, she can't understand it even after several different requests and often switches the show I want back to a pay-to-view channel instead of PBS. I ended up with some charges per show because I didn't realize she had switched me and hit ""play"" and didn't see the small print (really small print) that there was a charge until it was too late. So, I'm keeping it at this point but I will go back to my AppleTV when I can't stand it anymore. PBS is the only thing I watch on it and now I know to be very careful before clicking Play.!",positive
15,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"I got this during Prime Days for only $16! I was having a terrible time watching Amazon Prime with my old Firestick. It kept telling me I had no internet connection, the sound kept lagging, the remote wasn't in sync, Hulu lost connection all the time, and everything took forever to load. When I saw that I could get a new stick that was even better with the TV controls and the automatic access to Hulu, Netflix... I thought it was worth a try. So, yep everything is working great now, must of been my old other stick that was the issue. Hoping this new stick lasts. I love how quickly everything loads now I hit a button and boom I'm on Hulu. I also love that I can turn my tv on and off and adjust the volume on my Firestick now too. The only downside is I still have to get up and get to the right spot like I do when using the tv remote. I was hoping they would work sitting too like everything else on the Firestick. Overall I am so happy to have seamless streaming back and totally recommend this!",positive
16,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"Now that it’s properly set up, I love this Fire TV Stick HD with Alexa! I’m using it with a 2007 Vizio TV in the kitchen, and it’s giving me live and on-demand access to my favorite apps and TV. Did I mention that this TV doesn’t have Wi-Fi and that I planned to buy a new one to connect to my mesh setup? It was Prime week and I mentioned my plan to an IT tech at work and he suggested this HD fire stick. I bought it for more than 50% off! It was delivered the next day and I started the easy set-up process, but got stuck when asked to sign into my Amazon account to receive a code to input on the set-up screen. At this point it was all uphill with my limited tech skills. I didn’t think the Fire stick would work if I didn’t already have Alexa. Wrong!

The tech at work told me to bring it in, he used my Amazon account to set it up (the Fire stick has built in memory!), I took it home and plugged it in and voila! Now I can use Alexa and see my favorite TV series, along with Netflix and SiriusXM. I’m lovin it! Now that the Fire stick has saved me the cost of an updated TV, I’ll consider buying a new monitor!
Don’t give up on the set up!",positive
17,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"I use fire TV on both my televisions. I had an old model (no TV controls) that I just replaced with this one, which was offered at a very good price (under $20) during a Prime Days promotion. These install easily and the remote function is much better in every way than the older one this replaced. This particular model won't do 4k streaming but that isn't important to me. It's very simple to change a few settings on a Fire Stick, which will then allow you to download and use many apps available from 3rd party sources. Some of these apps are useful and many are trash, but that has nothing to do with the Fire TV Stick. The only real complaint I have is that these don't have as much memory as I would like, since I do personally use a lot of the 3rd part apps. Overall, if you are not big into watching live cable TV, this is a great way to save money. You can get apps that you have to subscribe to that will get you live sports and other cable-like services if you want, or you can just use free stuff... which is great if you're not a big TV watcher. Prime members get a selection of free movies and shows -- not a huge selection but it's included with Prime. Personally I don't see ever going back to a cable or satellite TV service that charges a fortune for lots of shopping channels and replays of the same movies over and over. I do miss live sports, but that's why there are sports bars.",positive
18,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), HD streaming device",$24.99,5,"My first firestick was the cheapest and lasted 7 years. It got great reception, for at the time I was so broke and borrowing a hospital across the streets Wi-Fi, better than any since in fact. So during this time I got my second to use in my bedroom, I live in a HUD apt less than 400sq ft, but though it was the newest, bestest Amazon had I could not pick up a signal anywhere.

Last year my original died so I ordered a new one, again the cheapest, but I now have Wi-Fi...slow but Wi-Fi. It worked quite well so during a sale I bought one that had tv remote with it. Loved it! So much so that when it went on sale again, I got a second for my bedroom. So, suffice to say I am pleased with the Firestick. I do like the luxury of only one remote to control tv and firestick. Sounds corny I know but after working my butt off my entire life my husband died from cancer, lost everything and living in filthy HUD apt so to me it is a luxury...one that I appreciate.",positive

The older versions seem to have problems connecting after awhile. With that said, this newer version is pretty nice! I like the channel buttons on the bottom of the firestick. It makes things easier for those who aren't tech savvy like the grandkids. The only reason I dropped a star was because this firestick wouldn't connect to our 3rd gen Alexa (she's my favorite). So I will have to put the 3rd gen in my office and put the 4th gen in the living room, which really isn't a big deal. Otherwise, we really like this new one.

20,Electronics,Apple AirTag,$29.00,5,"UPDATE: The app sucks. I walked around the entire perimeter of my property pressing play sound every couple seconds. It would mostly come back saying it's not in range and it would stop trying to play sound. Then at one point it said ""Playing sound"". Obvious sign it was nearby. I couldn't hear because of all the background birds and cicadas so I asked my kids to walk around me and eventually I was close enough to hear it ringing and I found it. I will be getting a better app to put it on and hopefully that app won't give me false readings.

I bought this to put on my cat understanding that it could come off and that it isn't recommended for tracking animals. I liked the idea that if it was lost, other iphones could sense it and help me locate it. Well the collar it was on came off at some point the other day (not airtag's fault). I went for a walk around the property to see if the app could sense it. At one point by the woodline of my property it told me that my airtag was seen nearby but it wouldn't play any sound. It said I wasn't close enough. I moved around and it would suddenly disappear. It would alert me on a different part of my property not near the first alert. It would then do the same thing. The app also did this with my watch that has been dead for a few weeks. We live in the woods and don't have close neighbors so it is unlikely that someone walked off with it. I understand that this issue isn't just with airtag, it is with the app as well. If I am able to find it, I am very likely to continue to use it but with a much different app. I am disappointed with Apple. I would not purchase again due to price and how inconsistent the app is..... I am willing to change my rating if problem is resolved.",positive
21,Electronics,Apple AirTag,$29.00,5,"⁃ Setting up the AirTag is easy. Pull the plastic cap and once the battery is connected to the AirTag and the AirTag is activated, the iPhone will recognize the AirTag and connect to it. It is connected to a specific Apple ID and once you connect the Airtag to the iPhone, you can designate what the AirTag will be used to trace/locate, for example, ‘Wallet’ ‘Keys,’ ‘BackPack’ and so on.
⁃ The use of a replaceable CR32 battery is a plus. Just twist the top cap and replace the battery by following the instructions on the polarity of the battery terminals.
⁃ I have an iPhone 8 Plus, so, the fancy ‘precision finding’ function that uses ‘AR’ and the arrow to point out the location of the AirTag as you approach it is not available. I knew that beforehand but it doesn’t minimize the effectiveness of this AirTag.
⁃ If you have an iPhone 6/6 plus and/or later, you’ll be able to use Bluetooth and NFC for tracking.
⁃ However, the AirTag works perfectly with the iPhone 8 Plus. All I need to do is expand the screen of my phone when on the ‘Find My’ app on the iPhone and activate the sound of the AirTag when I get close to the AirTag and once the AirTag starts beeping, then I can be able to trace it in its exact location.
⁃ The AirTag is excellent. If you leave the AirTag in a location and walk for about 2 minutes, or 0.1 miles, the iPhone immediately alerts you that you have left the AirTag and gives you the street address. When driving, the alert shows up after approximately 0.5 miles. Once you get the message on your iPhone, you then open the ‘Find My’ app on the iPhone and when you select ‘items’ at the bottom right of the app, you will then see the AirTag description and the blue dot that shows the location of the AirTag. As you walk back to the location of the AirTag, all you do is expand the screen on your phone and once you get to a couple of feet of the AirTag, you can press the ‘play sound’ button and the AirTag is going to start beeping.
⁃ I have now purchased 3 of these AirTags. I use one for my wallet, one for my keys and one for my backpack. I’ll definitely add more AirTags once the need arises.
⁃ The AirTag works so well such that, even when I go to the gym and leave my wallet and backpack in the gym locker and then go to the main floor to work out, about 50 or so feet, I get an alert on the iPhone notifying me that I have ‘left my Wallet/Backpack’ behind and gives me the gym address! Excellent!
⁃ You can disable notifications from the iPhone for certain locations so that, when you leave certain items like a backpack at home, you won’t keep getting notifications.
⁃ The ‘Find My’ app figures out where ‘Home’ is after a while (even before setting the home address on the ‘Maps’ app) and when you leave the AirTag at ‘Home,’ then the iPhone alerts you that you have left the AirTag at ‘Home.’ You can also set the ‘Home’ address on your iPhone’s ‘Maps’ app.
⁃ Just to show you how good the AirTags work, I attended a SuperBowl party and left my Backpack (with AirTag attached) at home. I had my wallet with me and my house keys in the car. The ‘Find My’ app was able to accurately pinpoint the location of my Wallet, (with me) my keys (in car, on road close to the Super Bowl host’s house) and my backpack, 44 miles away. The location of the backpack had been picked up by another iPhone that was close by the backpack.
⁃ I purchased a PSRAT 2 case wallet holder for my wallet AirTag and it works well. I purchased the Arae AirTag keychain holder for my keys and I got the Apple leather loop for my backpack.",positive
22,Electronics,Apple AirTag,$29.00,5,I have used my air tag for some time now and so far it has helped me find my wallet many times. I have tested it out many times and has successfully send me the right location of where it was left behind. A feature I truly love about the air tag is that it alerts you when you leave it behind it has helped me remember to take my wallet when I go out or when I leave it in my car. The downside of the air tag is that it takes a minute to find a signal weather there is too little light or your in a tall building it takes quite the while for the air tag to be located but once it is the tracking is awesome pinpointing it perfectly. Overall a great product but if Apple could improve the signal it would make it ten times Better.,positive
23,Electronics,Apple AirTag,$29.00,5,"I love this thing it made me feel so great when I was on vacation because every time I left my hotel room I was told where my bag was so I would always know if someone rummage through it or stole it. It was great at the airport as well! However, because so many people are using these now sometimes you will not really be able to track it as accurately especially when you’re getting on the plane. My last flight home I didn’t even know where my bag was until they started loading it up at the airport and it came back online. Prior to that it told me it was 1000 miles away back at the original airport. That’s just because most of the people on the plane had iPhones and AirTags. So the technology is new but I’m sure it will be better in the future. Even knowing that I still will buy more of these and put them in everything!",positive
24,Electronics,Apple AirTag,$29.00,4,"Then this may be the tool for you!
After my cat busted out of my window a couple of times, I decided to get this to help me keep track of him. Alright, listen, I know it says not to use it for pets. Yet compared to every other geo-tracking device, this thing is a steal, so I figured, let's at least try it. I attached it to my cat's collar with a little rubber band made for the purpose. I will say, it was incredibly easy to set up on my iPhone.
As for its ability to geo-track... well, it's kind of like a high-stakes game of hide-and-seek or hot-and-cold. You need to be close to the Airtag to get an exact location, and once it knows its exact location, instead of showing you on a map, it seems to just give you vague instructions like ""sixteen steps to the left,"" which could, I guess, do the job, but it doesn't really help that much. HOWEVER, once you get close enough to the item that it ""connects,"" you can have the Airtag play a noise, and THIS is super useful. I was able to find my cat by the noise but not by the onscreen instructions.
If you are not very close to the item already, it's not going to give you an exact location, and I think this is super important for pet parents to understand. I was able to find my cat when he was hiding in the basement and when he was in my yard, but if he were to go off of my property, it would only give me an approximate location of the Airtag based on its proximity to other Apple devices. If you live in a tightly packed neighborhood, this probably won't be an issue, because there are lots of devices around - but if you live in a rural area, for example, this would make the Airtag totally useless.
It does have a function that tells you when you've left your Airtag behind, which would be very handy if it were tracking something like my wallet, not my cat.

TLDR - It does exactly what it is advertised to do, and absolutely nothing more. If you're thinking about getting it to track a pet, consider its limitations before you do so. However, if you've got a cat that likes to shove itself into tiny impossible-to-find places and not come out, then this is perfect for you.",positive

The other day they got moved and I couldn't find them or who moved them. The air tag that I put in the bag worked great. No one stole them but I was able to find them quickly with my phone. I know people use these for travel and other items they need to keep track of and I can say this thing works. This will not be the only one I own going forward.,positive
26,Electronics,Apple AirTag,$29.00,5,"I bought these to track luggage. I had an airline lose my luggage for 5 days. Was eventually plopped on my front porch by Fed Ex but was most stressful experience. Even with their barcodes they couldn’t track. Turns out my bag never left France and it was rerouted through Germany then to me in the US. I didn’t connect through Germany!
Bought these for this trip and did absolutely nothing to them. They immediately came up on my iPhone as “Find my.”

So now that I am very apprehensive to check a bag but I was forced to do so in Vienna (horrible airport by the way and if you ever have to connect leave at least 4 hours in between flights) because they allow only 1 bag and even carry on must be a certain weight. No choice. Had to go. I had bought the waterproof plastic cases (from Amazon, of course) for these with a clip and attached in inside of my luggage.,I didn’t set it to any “mode.” I’m the least tech savvy person there is.

So was extremely worried when they took my bag for 5 hours. I was tracking it along the way from a good distance and up until the very last minute I could see it was loaded on. When waiting for bag could tell was getting closer to my backpack which was with me, What a huge relief! No more stranded bag sitting in a dark room somewhere, lonely, and missing me. Got to the airport and there was my bag on carousel. IT MADE IT. I could see every move throughout those 5 hours so knew they were transferring it to my next flight,
Very highly recommend, especially for travelers.

These were so worth it to have piece of mind. I bought 2 as used one for backpack., I don’t know how far they trace but I have read it can trace anywhere. Won’t give precise location but gives general area. Would very highly recommend.

Work as international flight attendant and will be using these in my crew luggage as well as keeping a coiled lock to lock bags together in overhead bin to keep from wandering off.
Definitely highly recommend as well as the waterproof cases they come in with clips or can attach to keychain or something else.

* For those saying can not attach it to anywhere are many variants of holders that can allow you to attach to anything. I bought clear, waterproof ones with 2 different ways to attach. They’re available on Amazon and work well. I’ve walked quite a distance away while leaving suitcase back in the apartment and it would notify me I was away and where it was last seen.",positive

I was able to zoom in on the exact trailer my AirTag was in! I could even see which of the trailer it was packed in! In the morning, I watched live as it drove ~300 miles up the highway to Amazon in Vegas.
Amazing.

UPDATE: 8/25. I learned how to geofence it and I get alerts if I’m separated from it, but I’m still not happy with the whole thing. We tested a simulated theft. I got a notice that the car left the geofence, but tracking was poor. I traveled 8 miles out and stopped. I received one update of the tagged car’s location at about 4 miles from the starting point. I kept watching and looking for updates as the car moved through populated areas, through heavy traffic. There was even an iPhone carrier in that car. They pulled up next to me at a busy shopping center, but the ‘find my’ function still showed the car at the 4 mile location. The whole exercise took about 15 minutes and I only received one location update, which was also the first notice the car had left the geofenced area.

30,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,4,"Being an all Apple household I have to say this device impressed me quite a bit. I purchased a Firestick Lite over a year ago to take with me for travel but it had a bit of lag and seemed to have network drop outs on hotel WiFi (I know hotel WiFi is less than desired but it was annoying). In December this device was on sale for over half off and I decided to try it out. This was after I had gotten the previous Firestick 4K which was a decent product but I found out it for whatever reason cannot get the latest software (but the ""less capable"" Firestick Lite can, baffling I know). I purchased this one and sent back the FireStick 4K as the refund on the Firestick 4K covered the cost of this one and then some.

Things that impressed me (with caveats):

1. Ability to use captive portal internet. Currently the tvOS on the AppleTV does not allow for this unless you go through a process to spoof the MAC address of a device on the captive portal or somehow get a hold of the internet provider's help desk to have them add the MAC address. A ""dance"" I successfully completed once but by the time I was complete it was too late to watch anything. Caveat, this will be resolved with the upcoming release of tvOS 15.4 as the beta version has the ability to connect to captive portal internet in hotels.

2. Ease of use - plug it into the HDMI port and power via the Micro USB port via the TV or power brick. Then sign into your Amazon account.

3. Picture is really good on both 4K TVs and 1080 TVs

4. Responsive when going through menus and applications - caveat, if there is enough storage available to make memory and swap cache available. (See below).

5. Main screen is customizable and you are able to set your favorite applications there. Especially helpful for use by kids.

6. Ability to set multiple profiles. I have two daughters and was able to add the kids profiles that they use on their Amazon Fire Kids tablets. We will not go into the annoyances with the Kids interface. Caveat related to limited storage and having to ""download"" applications to the Kid's profile is counts towards the storage limit.

Annoyances:
1. Amount of storage is only 8GB? It's 2022 Amazon could afford to add more storage to these devices without adding much to the cost. Even 16GB of flash storage would be better. Having to offload applications in order to make cache available to applications can properly run gets old. Yes, I understand you can attach an external device to this for giving it more storage via a hub for applications but that negates the ""throw it in your backpack and go"" idea I bought it for.

2. Not being able to easily close down applications to make more RAM and storage available (see above). I know this device is more or less running Amazon's version of Android, but even a quick way to shut down applications from the remote would be convenient.

3. The constantly running ads in the main interface and now the ads that pop-up when using live streaming applications like DirectTV Stream. We've come accept commercials are annoying enough when watching broadcast TV but an ad that takes over the screen in the middle of the program is a bit too far.

4. No geo-location ability. This means applications that have the ability to ""know"" where it is based on the IP address of the internet will automatically know which channels to load (or allow you to ""spoof"" your location with a VPN). If this is not present services like DirectTV Stream default to the billing zip code and you are locked to the channels for your billing zip code.

5. Kid's Profile cannot be sorted and customized in the same way the regular profile can. Unlike the AppleTV, it is not a profile set with age restrictions and purchase restrictions and it being there same interface as the adult profiles. It might be cute to have a kids interface but it's annoying for kids who already know how to navigate the regular interface. It is the same type of profile that the tablet has and more or less shows what ""Amazon thinks they would like"" based on habits. Applications cannot be pinned and in addition to this they have to be re-downloaded after being added to their profile instead of just appearing on the profile. This counts towards the used storage. Amazon needs to fix this across all of their devices and do what iOS and tvOS does and have a data partition for a user with applications be available to all users so you do not have to re-download applications. The above said, I've deleted the kids profiles. My kids only go to the pinned applications and access their profiles continued in those applications.

6. All of the privacy settings are automatically set to ""allow"" - location, watching history, targeted ads, application downloads etc. You have to go into every application as well as the settings for the device and the application setting on the device to turn all of this off. Unless you really ""dig"" the settings are kinda hidden which is the point as Amazon makes a ton of money off of selling the data provided by the device and applications to 3rd parties.

7. Updates are a PITA. Update notifications are given but not for how many or what they are for. Usually it takes several attempts to check for and run all of the updates. Several times I have thought I bricked the device as it seems to hang when ""installing"". Backing out of the update, restarting the device and running the scan for updates then shows the update completed and another update is showing. This is a common theme with all Android based devices.

Conclusion:
If you are an Apple user and looking for something that give you access to your streaming services (Disney+, Netflix, Hulu, DirectTV Stream, PBS etc) on the as well as AppleTV+ this device will do the job. If you are like me this will more than likely be your travel and secondary device that gets tossed in or stays in a bag. DO your due dillgence and turn on all of the privacy settings to ""off"" or ""do not allow"" for the FireOS and each application, this usually stops the ads during live TV streams.",positive
31,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,5,"In the past, it was hard to get all your favorite streaming apps in one place or even impossible. You either had to buy a new smart DVD player with the streaming apps or an expensive smart TV that also has the streaming apps. Now you can buy a small TV stick that gets plugged into your Tv, and it has everything on it. So, I bought it, and I have to say that I’m thoroughly impressed with the Fire TV Stick 4K Max. This device stick and remote truly shows how far we have come with technology. I was hesitant to buy it at first because I wasn’t sure if it was worth the money, or if it would even work since there are some bad reviews about it. However, I will have to disagree with those bad reviews. I love this Fire TV Stick 4K Max because it lets me watch whatever I want from my favorite subscription apps, it’s now easier to find a movie or TV show with Alexa, the home screen display is easy to navigate, and the processor is so much faster.
When I first review a product, the most important thing I look for is accuracy. Did the product come with everything included in the box? Is it accurate to the product's description? The answer to these questions is yes. In the box, you get: Fire TV Stick 4K Max, an Alexa voice remote, HDMI extender cable for the Fire TV Stick 4K Max, USB cable with the power adapter, 2 AAA batteries, and a quick start guide. The Fire TV Stick came in a well-packaged box, and it looks exactly like the pictures on the Fire TV Stick 4K Max product detail page on Amazon.
The Fire TV Stick 4K Max has all the streaming apps that were said in the product’s description, plus many more additional apps. I know some of the other reviews said that a few of the streaming apps were not working, but that was not the case for me. All the major streaming apps are on here like: Netflix, Disney +, HBO Max, Hulu, Prime Video, YouTube, plus many more. I personally like the fact that you have to manually download each streaming app because it lets you have the streaming apps you want, and not use the GBs on streaming apps you don’t use. I’ve also noticed that the processing time for each app to open is so much faster than what I used to have. In the past, it would take up to a minute for my smart DVD player to open the streaming services, and now it only takes seconds to open.
Along with all the streaming apps that I wanted; the Fire Tv Stick came with other accessories. There are a bunch of other streaming apps that are available to download in the Appstore, and I didn’t even recognize some of them. You can also download some games from their Appstore too. However, I haven’t downloaded any of them, so I can’t really say if they are any good. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max also allows you to watch live news without having to switch to the cable Tv, and these are only the main accessories.
Another thing I like about the Fire Tv Stick 4K Max is the layout of the home page and the remote. On the home page, there is a small bar that lets you put 6 streaming apps you want on there, so they will be faster to find. When you’re browsing on the home page, a lot of the time a trailer or video clip will pop up on the top right corner that’s about the movie or TV show. This is nice for knowing what a movie or show is all about. The remote has 4 preset buttons for Prime Video, Netflix, Disney +, and Hulu, which makes it easier to open those apps. It was also nice to see that the volume buttons work. Since, in the past, I always had to use the cable TV remote to adjust the volume; it was a hassle to have 2 different remotes to control the TV.
If you’re still not convinced, then I think the cherry on top is the Alexa button that might convince you. The Alexa voice button is very convenient, and it makes streaming the different apps so effortless. It’s now easier than ever to search for your favorite movie or TV show with just your voice; you don’t have to look through each streaming app to see who has it on-demand or look it up on your phone. With the Alexa voice button, you just have to say what you want to watch, and Alexa will find it for you to watch it. The Alexa feature on the TV also works like any other Alexa device, so it also allows you to look up news events, weather forecasts, and listen to music. This is nice for people who don’t have any other Alexa device since it’s like a built-in Alexa device for your TV.
Now that you have read my review, I hope I’ve made your decision on buying the Fire TV Stick 4K Max easier. Whether you are still contemplating on buying it or not, I still think this is a great product. It is a great way to watch your movies and shows with your favorite streaming apps from one place. This little TV stick is so smart, and the Alexa voice button is a very nice feature to have. So, in conclusion, I definitely recommend buying this Fire TV Stick 4K Max.",positive
32,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,5,"Here's my disclaimer: I didn't install it myself. My daughter did that, and she did so in a a matter of minutes -- versus the deathless aeons it would have taken me.

If you're old-fashioned, or simply old, like I am, you might be dragging your feet because you can't see yourself making the leap to less expensive television. You feel that you'll be lost when it comes to the new technology, and damn it, things are just changing TOO much, and you'll never keep up, so why not just stay the way you are. At the same time, however, you're complaining ""How can it be that I have literally hundreds of channels, but there's nothing on I want to watch?""

Depending on the screening services you load, you'll very likely save a good deal of money over the year.

I'm assuming most people reading this have Amazon Prime, and that you've had it for some time, so you're already eligible for all of the extensive streaming there. Netflix is also terrific (I canceled my mailed discs), and also great are HBO Max, Hulu, Disney, Discovery, and Paramount (I LOVE me some YELLOWSTONE) and many others. All cost money to join, but the prices are often around or under $10 a month. You can join several services for under $30 - $40 a month... and that's a lot cheaper than the over $100 many of us already paying to see those hundreds of shows you don't watch.

And for those who are worried (I'm talking to you, fellow Elder Folk) that this new type of navigating will be something unimaginably difficult, think again. In essence, here it is: you click on pictures. It's that simple.

And though certain services come with commercials, the amount is minimal, and often under a minute. It's nothing at all like the cable services,

The picture quality is amazing, and I can't detect any lag or delay in my viewing; and there is excellent sound through the Dolby Atmos; and there is also the ability to use enhanced voice searching through Alexa (which can also be done remotely).",positive
33,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,1,"After hours of trying to set up this product and thinking its finally working multiple times I keep encountering more product bugs. I purchased the top of the line 4K Max stick and found the following:

1) Spent an hour setting up the stick, added our family’s amazon account and it downloaded the Kids’ profiles. Cool experience, Amazon Kids UI for the kids —- if it worked. Everytime I tried to swap to one of the Kids’ profiles an error message appeared saying an error occurred changing profiles and to try again later. Changing to adult profiles worked fine.

Called Amazon Fire support, they didn’t have that error in their documentation, but they had me factory reset the stick which erased all the apps and settings I just finished setting up.

After the reset the Kids’ profiles would open, so I spent several hours downloading various apps and authenticating each one with my cable provider - one by one so I could watch ABC, NBC, etc. Some apps were better than others and detected they were on a cable provider’s connection, where others required me to manually login, most required going to a webpage and entering a code to unlock streaming.

2) The Amazon video app isn’t compatible with Amazon Kids mode. If you press the Amazon video app button on the remote while in Kids mode an error appears saying the app isn’t supported. This makes sense, kind of, since Kids mode is its own video app, but the experience here is broken.

3) After I thought everything finally worked I tried to actually watch a video as my Kid’s account. Black screen, nothing! Left the kid profile and went to an adult and then back and the video started playing suddenly. Tried that same step again for another video and it wouldn’t play. Rebooted stick and video played without issue.

Update: Day#2: Kids woke up and tried to watch videos. They were able to intuitively navigate the remote control, however, they woke us up saying the videos didn’t work. The Amazon Kids video black screen returned again. I was able to go back and get to an adult profile with our parental code and everything worked fine - this is a bug in the Kids app. Reboot fixed it again, but who wants to need to teach their kids to reboot their fire stick every few days?

Day#3 Kids were watching videos and turned off TV. They tried to turn on TV and the screen was black. I needed to know to try to navigate to home from the black screen. This felt like a poor implementation of HDCP copy protection where it stopped playback when the TV was turned off but didn’t display a message or return gracefully to the video app.

4) The video in general was horrible on my TV - just about everything had a flicker, including menus, etc. I disabled HDR and it fixed the issues.

5) When exiting and returning to kids mode (including a different child’s profile) the screen will display the prior child’s screen content, go black and then end up where expected on the correct child’s profile home screen

6) Performance is really bad at times when not doing anything taxing. This is especially true when trying to add applications. I tried to download several at a time in queue and one of them errored out during the install (not the download). Lots of navigation lags and freezes. This reminds me of an old cable box when they first supported on demand and apps - changing from one app to another was slow and often long load screens. Same here, except its inconsistent. It acts like the storage in the stick is low end and can’t keep up at times.

7) There appears to be no system-wide way to disable the voice remote feature. A couple apps supported this feature, but those were seldom.

8) The remote control feels cheap. The left/right/up/down/select buttons feel flimsy especially given how often they get used. The remote in general was smaller and lighter than expected.

9) The whole apps experience is annoyingly complex. They have featured apps which they make easy to find, but then you can get the app store app to go search for other apps. The home screen feels like Amazon Video with rows of video content recommendations and upsells, but no way to customize the tiles. To get to apps you’ve installed you need to scroll over to the add app icon in the menu bar which will show installed apps. There is no option to make that the default landing screen when the home button is pressed, nor promote all apps to the home screen (or turn off all of the other video and app upsells/recommendations on the home screen

10) my Fire stick has updated multiple times tonight fully. Support insists that a factory reset wouldn’t revert system updates, but yet it needed updates after the factory reset. Undesirable but understandable. But whats more odd is the stick has been “fully up to date” and then later needing updates 2-3 times since then.

11) on the home screen (filled with recommendations of apps and videos) there is no filter options to only display things we own. Many video apps (such as Amazon video) have intermixed free and ads in their menus - this is more of that style of approach, except its on a hardware device which was needed to be purchased vs a software video app. Meanwhile the apps which will show content we subscribe to (ABC, NBC, etc) get pushed to another place which is obscurely navigated to via an icon in the menu bar which looks like its for adding new apps.

12) Also, I’ve found that in the Kids video app there is not an easy way to ply a video from the beginning. There is a single play arrow which resumes the video from the last location. To play from the beginning we need to start playback and rewind or go into a more options menu and select play from beginning. This is in the Kids video app, which makes it far too complex for small kids. Why Amazon omitted their play from beginning icon which is present on their other platforms is unclear and an usability miss.

13) There are parent profiles and Kids profiles, but the parent profiles don’t timeout if they sit idle for too long. Ideally if we forget to logout in the evening the Fire stick would have an option after x hours to return to the profile screen so the kids have access to kid safe content

14) while idle, the Fire screen saver with no one logged in seems to be scenic landscapes, but when logged in to a parent profile I saw video upsells which are not always young kid appropriate (action adventure video upsells). Ex: code black ad with a photo of a guy screaming with a scary face, yellow jacket image of girl with bugged out eyes, bloody nose, bee on face, I know what you did last summer image of partly topless (but not explicit) people. The entire screen saver is a rotating advertisement when logged in vs the scenic landscapes displayed when logged out.

The top banner image bar on the adult profile having a picture of a lady with a bloody nose big eyes and bumble bees on her face (ad for yellow jackets) wasn’t toddler appropriate.

Although this was all while in a parent profile, I didn’t expect simply sitting at a home screen menu would be inappropriate for young kids.

15) This is missing feature vs a bug, but there is not an “Input select” button on the Fire remote. So while it can volume up, power on/off a TV there is no way to change to another device without walking over to the TV or keeping another remote around. This isn’t an issue if Fire stick is the only thing plugged in to the TV, but if there is a game console plugged in, a cable box, etc being able to change inputs is more annoying because of that one button not existing on the remote. Plugging the fire stick to an Xbox HDMI input/passthrough might be a work around but that adds complexity and devalues the stick’s appeal of having all the apps on it ( most of which also exist on the Xbox)",negative
34,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,4,"I bought this Fire TV Stick 4K MAX just to listen to Amazon Music HD/UHD that I'm in a free trial. My Denon AVR-2312ci is a 192Khz/24 bit compatible PCM receiver. I have played numerous 192Khz/24 bit songs in PCM through this receiver without any problems. The Fire Stick 4K MAX will only play at 48khz/16 bit. It also gives false info to the Denon where it thinks it's a 192Khz song. Fact is that it displays on the Denon information screen as 192Khz when app output states 44.1Khz, 48Khz, 96Khz, or 192Khz.

Looks like I found the problem. The UHD audio setting under the Amazon Music Unlimited app glitches. When it glitches, the UHD audio states enabled but as it is stating this, the app displayed output is only 16 bit audio at 48Khz. Then when the main app audio setting is disabled, then the app display states the output is 24 bit 192Khz or 96Khz (depending on the source). After restarting the Fire TV Stick 4K max, it did go back as it should. Weird how it glitches on the apps audio setting so once it's enabled, do not toggle it back and forth as it will glitch again. I confirmed all this in my Denon's information display. What I did find, no matter the source HD/UHD sampling frequency or the app displayed output sampling frequency quality, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max up samples the actual HDMI output to 192Khz, as stated in my Denon receiver information display.

What I also did, is compare the normal lossy standard quality signal output from Amazon Music Unlimited on my Roku devices. I have Roku devices and Fire TV sticks in both of my HT systems. I compared at 16 bit/44.1Khz on my regular Fire TV stick and the Fire TV Stick 4K Max. 16 bit/44.1Khz is what a CD plays at and is considered CD quality. With both systems, the CD quality music absolutely blew away the Standard lossy quality on my Roku devices which is actually higher quality than Spotify or Pandora!! The difference was HUGE. The CD quality played about 4 - 5 db quieter obviously for higher dynamic peaks, and the frequency response was a lot fuller with a lot more detail and bass. The imaging was much more focused with greater detail than the standard lossy audio. The standard lossy audio was was more diffused and not as focused, and had a harsher sound with less bass.

The quality difference from standard lossy audio to CD quality 16 bit/44.1Khz was huge and actually a huge reason not to ever listen to lossy audio again. I heard the same with MP3 songs even at a high bit rate, before but thought things were better now. Didn't realize just how much fidelity I was losing by listening to Standard lossy audio. Maybe now that I have found lossless audio on Amazon Music Unlimited HD, I may try using the Fire TV Sticks for all my movie apps instead of just Amazon Music Unlimited HD. I'll see how the Stick goes with music. Obviously, UHD audio at 24 bit depth sounds much better than HD (CD audio quality) at 16 bit depth, wit greater detail.

The main thing I hate about these Fire Sticks is that the Amazon Music Unlimited app continues to play music even after you hit the home button to get out of the app. So it's still sucking all my data on my WIFI while I'm not using it!! There needs to be a work around so that it stops playing music when the home button is pushed like on Roku!!

I'm giving it a new rating from 1 to 4, since the app had the glitch instead of the fire stick. The glitch needs to be fixed so it can operate correctly on the 4K Max Stick. After all, they are both from the SAME COMPANY!",positive
35,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,4,"I have a Wifi 6 supported router (BGW 320-505 Nokia) from AT&T with up to a gig of speed using fiber. The Firestick 4K Max is very fast at loading apps and the picture quality is very good. Audio is also very good but occasionally there is a sync issue with someone speaking. This might not have anything to do with the Firestick though. I was using Chromecast with Google TV as I have YouTube TV and as you would expect they worked seamlessly together. The picture and sound quality is pretty much the same with the Firestick being quicker to go from app to app or load. The Firestick also has picture in picture which is great with my security cameras. There is a lot to like here including the live TV area. I do wish the live channels could be arranged by preference, maybe there is a way and I just haven't figured it out. Here is what I am not crazy about, the menu or landing page. The Home, Find, Live in my opinion should be at the top of the page horizontal or vertical. This would allow for more apps to show as opposed to 6 and should simply scroll with no need to drop to an apps area (3 little squares). I would also prefer the viewing recommendations pull from the apps I use up front versus being lost down the menu. Prime content takes precedence pretty much over everything. Once in your app that doesn't really matter but what does matter is the ads, which can be annoying. All in all there are things I like and things I dislike.",positive
36,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,5,"If over 68,000 reviews weren't enough, here's one more. Set-up was easy and straight-forward with no issues. Less than 5 minutes, including unboxing, installation and then configuration.

This model replaces a prior generation 4k FireTV stick that I've been using the last two years. After signing up for HBOMax a few days ago, I noticed some issues with the TV show 'Barry' blacking out video after a few minutes, even though I could hear the sound. Rewinding the show a bit, and then re-starting the stream would resolve the issue. Having an IT background, it seemed that this may be indicative of a memory/buffering issue with the old 4k FireTV stick I've been using. So, in this one goes today. It does seem to resolve the issue.

Another benefit is that even though I only have a 1080HD TV, the image quality/clarity is noticeably better for me on YouTubeTV, Hulu and HBOMax - the apps I tested today. The improvement on YouTubeTV definitely seems to be related to the memory upgrade, as the stream is coming through at full HD, instead of ratcheting down a level. Noticed that I did need to change some brightness and contrast settings on my TV, as they tended to be just a bit darker with this stick. 2 minutes on my TV display settings, now its all good.

Update: Have upgraded my home wifi to wifi 6, and the stream via this 4k Max stick is impeccable. No stutter, flicker, etc. Super clean and crisp on all fronts.",positive

Apple TV 4K is $199, Amazon’s best 4k stick is $55.

Couple things that happened when I spent the $55 on the amazon 4k Max stick :

1. All the episodes of Jack Ryan were available on prime , on my smart tv’s prime app this didn’t happen, only season 2!?!

2. Sound and video were improved even though I had supported apps on my smart tv, and I cannot begin to tell you how much improvement I saw on Dolby Atmos support, especially Disney Plus and HBO Max , which had the apps on my smart tv but their Dolby Atmos sound was much better on the fire stick max 4k! Also Dolby Atmos support on the apps on the smart tv wasn’t perfect as Disney Plus didn’t have that support until I upgraded to the Fire Stick 4k Max! Then I had the best possible support for audio and video!

3. Dolby Vision is supported and HDR is supported and in a much improved manner so the $55 upgrade was completely unexpected and absolutely needed!

It’s the upgrade you thought you really didn’t need until you saw considerable improvements and apps that are more frequently updated on the platform!",positive
38,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,5,"If you watched any science fiction shows like Disney's OBI-WAN series, the majority of the film takes place at night. With my previous firestik, all I saw was shadows. I have a state-of-the-art 8K Sony OLED TV, and complained about still not being able to see anything in a dark scene. But my daughter told me that she read that the problem might be with the firestick itself. She read a review that said the 4K Max was much better at low light conditions. So, I waited for Prime Day (my new holy day of obligation) and got this baby... I immediately went to OBI-Wan and....Darned if it wasn't 100% better. I could actually see the scene where Darth Vader in black fights Obi-wan. It really isn't just glowing light sabers!

So, if you have read this far and were worried about why you want this stick vs. the other choices out there, rest assured that you will not regret this purchase, which improves upon the firestick in every way. It is faster, more responsive, has a better remote, and is overall better at sound, closed captioning, and video quality. Nicely done, Mr. Bezos!",positive
39,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick 4K Max streaming device, Wi-Fi 6, Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls)",$39.99,4,"Have a Pendant, 4K, and now a 4K Max. Would say the Max has a bit of a performance increase over the Pendant, but can see no difference between the 4K and the Max. To be fair, am NOT using Wi-Fi 6, so if more performance can be found there, I wouldn't be able to see it. It's possible users who noticed a Performance Increase could have gotten similar results with their older devices by doing a Factory Reset to clear out years of bloat. Even doing a simple deregister/register can get rid the cobwebs.

Physical install was simply connecting the Max and AC adapter to the existing Ethernet and HDMI. Only downside was the 4K Max's option to Pre-install applications and settings from other registered devices was only about 80% effective. Some of the Pre-installed applications were corrupt and weren't available on the home screen, while others needed an immediate update as the Pre-installed versions were quite old. Easier to install applications manually to guarantee the most current versions and no scrambled installs.

Saved a total of $36 off the Regular price - $20 by purchasing it on Prime Day 2022, and another $16 for Trading In the Fire Pendant when placing the order for the 4K Max. Performance Arguments aside, Trading in an Older Device may have other advantages, as was squinting at the Random Fine Print and read that the Fire Pendant was (allegedly) only set to Receive Updates as far as somewhen in 2022. While I don't have a lot applications installed, like the 4K Max's option of purchasing an On The Go (OTG) adapter to connect a USB flash drive and offload 3rd party applications to save internal storage space.",positive
40,Electronics,Apple AirTag 4 Pack,$99.00,4,"Got Air Tags for each of my dogs. Even decided to update my phone to better track them, but that's not happening until April. We live in the wilderness. There are very few people out here and fewer iphones. When our dogs go exploring, we can't find them via the AirTag (though one time my dog appearantly came across a hiker with an iphone as she registered as being on the trail.) However, when my husband goes biking and takes the dog, as long as they have cellphone coverage, we can see where they're at.

This morning I took Annie with me to pick up a Home Depot curbside order. Ran into Target to get some lettuce. Came out and Annie was gone. It became appearant I left the back windows open too much and she jumped out.

The Air Tag had issues. It would tell me where she was, so I would drive there, but by the time I got there, she was gone. It wouldn't refresh and look for her, so I kept missing her. Called Apple to see if they could track her, but they said they're not meant for a moving target. I filed her as lost in the app, but once she blipped on my phone, it automatically shut off the ""Notify when found"" even though I hadn't found her, she'd just been in the vicinity. So while I was frantically trying to find her, I was having to set the app to notify me when it found her. However, it let me know about where she was so I knew how to focus my search.

She spent most of her day in the a wild, dry river wash where the tag wouldn't signal because it's below street level and there were no iphones down there. (Though when I was near her a couple times it didn't ding. One of those times was when I ran into really busy traffic to stop cars from hitting her, so we were in cell zone and she was close to my phone.) Met some really nice people (a mall security guard and some homeless people) that spent hours helping me find her. Plus a dad and daughter on bikes that just happened to see her. Three times she and I looked at each other and she ran away from me. I've heard dogs go into survival mode after about a week on the road and will run from their families, but this was only a few hours. (She was feral when I got her so maybe she just reverted faster.) Finally, at sunset, I went home. Except she kept beeping off the AirTag. (She only did that once an hour during the day and now it was more frequent.) I worried she'd been hit by a car.

I drove back to the mall with Harvey, her dog-BFF. For three hours she circled around me and Harvey. She was afraid of us, but she was also staying near and watching. When she went away, Harvey and I went into the van to escape the cold. Then the air tag would ding. We'd get out of the car and play ""Where's Waldo"" in the dark. Eventually I'd see her just standing there watching us from the shadows. Then she'd disappear agin. Then the tag said she was back. I wondered if this would be easier with a newer iphone as mine is only a 7Plus.

At 12:40 a.m., she walked towards the van. I partially opened the door and stuck my head out. ""Hi, Annie."" And finally, she recognized me. After 13 hours of driving, walking, riding my bike (my husband brought me my bike,) and sitting out in the cold so she could see me, she finally recognized me. She wagged her tail, came up to me, and got in the van.

The AirTag had issues, but it gave me ideas as to where she was. Without the tag, I would not have been able to find her. A few years ago our rescued ex-bait dog stayed with my parents while we were on vacation. They live a couple hours away. Shortly after we got home, the dog jumped their fence. I drove up immediately to try and find her. We looked for two weeks. She was sighted so many different places miles apart (Facebook has great dog-finding groups.) Saddly, she was hit and killed. If she'd had an AirTag, we would have known about where she was and we would have found her. I hope the AirTag works better when I get my Iphone 13 in a couple weeks. However, even not working great, it saved my dog's life.",positive
41,Electronics,Apple AirTag 4 Pack,$99.00,4,"I went camping and left my camper keys on the truck bumper by mistake and drove off and they eventually fell off as I was driving. Later, my Phone said I left my keys behind and I immediately realized what happened. So I drove to where the tag said my keys were on the side of a 2 lane country highway. This was probably only an hour after the keys fell off my bumper and I looked all over using the “Find It” app but couldn’t locate the keys and I drove home very disappointed. About 6 hours later I noticed that the app was now saying the keys were at a different address. So again I drove to the updated address and I walked to the location my phone was reporting. And this time my phone connected to the tag and listed the number of feet and direction to walk and it led me right to the keys. So I believe what happened is that some other iPhone person walked past the tag during the day close enough for the app to update the location and I suspect that is why it worked on the 2nd attempt. So overall really happy. Only 4 star because I found it pretty useless to track my dog in my yard. I had to be within 15 feet of the dog in order for it to work. I was wanting it to be able to confirm that the dog was still in my yard when it walked off to an area where I could no longer see her. Also, the sound of chime is much too low to be useful in some situations like when you standing on the side of a busy road with traffic going by there is no way you would hear the chime.",positive
42,Electronics,Apple AirTag 4 Pack,$99.00,5,"I wanted so way to track my bags as we ventured again into the staggering airline and luggage handling systems. Everyone is short-staffed. Qantas is now recruiting baggage handlers from their corporate executives. We heard one horror story after another about lost bags, bags that went on lovely vacations all over Europe and Asia while their owners looked for places to buy clean underwear.

I bought this 4-pack with no experience in this device--based on reviews and advice from friends.

I have an iPhone and it was easy(ish) to set up. The first AirTag I set up would not pair, but that was my fault. I was not familiar with the app on my phone. Start that first so it's ready to pair as soon as you pull out the plastic battery activation strip. I had to figure out how to take out the battery (again, not simple, but I figured it out) to reset the tag.

Once activated, the FindMy app on my phone notified me when I walked away from the bags. At first, it seemed like having a child calling out ""Daddy! Don't leave me here."" But it was handy to see the bag begin its own tour of the baggage system. I could see it was not on the plane as I took my seat, but seconds later it reported to be ""nearby.""

No, I did not put the tags on the outside of the bags so I didn't need the rubber holder and D ring. I tucked each one inside a zippered pocket--buried under my socks. It worked fine. I didn't want them to snag on luggage handling equipment or be pulled off by angry baggage handlers.

So what did I pay for? Peace of mind. Now that I'm back I'm wondering if I should slip one into my wife's purse. Seriously, she's a senior (as am I) and it would be nice to know where she is when she's out and away from the house. Incidentally, the tags are magnetic so you might be able to stick them on the refrigerator if you're afraid of it walking away in the night... ;)",positive

I am so absent-minded I always misplace my wallet and keys. I have tried to always put them in the same spot - in a bowl - when I get home. However, I forget to do it and end up looking everywhere for them. These solved that problem. I never seem to lose my phone.

You can search for your item and the phone points to where it is and how far away. If you still cannot find it, you can make it play a kinda quiet beeping sound.

I put one in my car for two reasons. First it helps to let me know where I parked at the mall or if I am at work. Second, if it is stolen, I can tell the cops exactly where my car is. Good luck trying to find where the AirTag is hidden.

Registering the device is as simple as setting it on top of your phone and following the prompts. The first time you walk off away from it, it will ask if you want to be notified every time you leave it behind. Also, if you put one in your spouse’s car, it will tell them there is an AirTag following them if they have an iPhone too. It prevents you from tracking someone with nefarious intents.

I put one in each of my two 4-wheelers, one in my kayak (theft is a growing concern), one is in my purse and one in a dog collar case. The only issue I have is the one I use in my dog collar. I live in rural Missouri with valleys and hills. My dog likes to visit the neighbor about a mile and a half down the road. I cannot track him when he leaves due to the terrain and his low build to the ground, I suppose. Usually I know where he goes and when I get closer to him and we are both on top of a hill the tag shows up on my phone. Well, I kind of expected that in the Ozarks.
On a good note, the tags will notify you if you leave them behind. You can individually name each tag making it easy to tell them apart. The app on your phone shows you when it was last seen and you can locate it with features provided. My dog lost the one in his collar but I was able to find it using the lost feature, and even zooming in to the direct spot in which it lay, right next to the tractor.
The batteries last a long, long time.

45,Electronics,Apple AirTag 4 Pack,$99.00,4,"Ok for the most part I love these things. I bought them for my old boss because his elderly wife sets stuff down and forgets where she put it.
I really like the location finder although it doesn’t seem very refined yet.
I put his keys in the office and let him use the finder to locate them. Eventually he did but sometimes the direction wasn’t very accurate but most the time it was pretty good.

Now what I don’t like. There is a major limitation. You can only use the tag with one Apple ID at a time.
So his wife’s stuff purse wallet and keys are tied to her Apple ID and his keys to his.
For the most part this should work fine however say she set her purse down and can’t remember where and her phone was in her purse these are useless without her phone. We couldn’t tie them so both the husband and wife could find each other’s items. Yes I know you can use find my app but a lot of time although she can see his phone hers says unknown.
So if your a parent wanting to track your kids things well either you can pair it or them but not both.
This is a big limitation and apple should come up with a solution so you can pair with more than one I’d or at least share tracking with one of your family or friends.
The firm was going to get some to put in laptop bags hidden however we didn’t do it because then only one person could track all the laptops.

46,Electronics,Apple AirTag 4 Pack,$99.00,5,"All I will say is that those stories you here about people losing their bags and then finding them because they have Airtags - they're true. Happened to us the first time we used them when the Delta agent only checked our bags through to our connection and not our final destination. We were able to monitor the progress of the bags through the Airtags; at one point, we knew our bags were in Greece when Delta thought they were still in NY. In fact, we were able to pinpoint the bags to a certain room when the agent swore up and down they weren't in there. We were both right: the bags were in the room one floor below! That saved us a day in getting our bags instead of waiting for the airline to deliver them. Two things: pick up the silicone cases (they're $10 for four and when you get home, use them. If you have pets, put them on them (there are small collar cases on Amazon for sale). Put them in your bag, your purse, your car, whatever. Use these - they are truly a remarkable piece of technology.",positive

Visit the Apple Store

These have so many uses. They're water resistant, They're pretty tough on their own, but I chose to vault them for extra protection on the dog's collar. They take a common watch battery, and the battery lasts a year or so. Your iPhone will tell you when the battery is low. They're not huge (1 photo with a US Penny alongside as reference).

They're not perfect. You can depend upon the Apple Community to help you locate a missing item, but I can see drawbacks to that too. When you're at your home, for instance, and lose your keys, you still have to walk around your house from room to room before the Find my Phone feature will activate to help you narrow your search. Otherwise, and to begin with, it just shows the item is at your address somewhere. But once you get closer, arrowed directions show up on your phone's screen to point you to the location, and even tells you how many feet you are away. They're kind of expensive, but a 4-pack is a little cheaper. I've had Tiles before and I like these better.

I do wish that they would let you connect more than 1 iPhone to each tag. It tags to your Apple ID. I wish there was a permission the owner could code in or authorize so that at least 2 phones could be tagged to each AirTag. My daughter and I had to decide which one of us was going to have our German Shepherd's collar tagged to our phone. This means that we cannot split up to find the dog if he ever gets out of our yard, not without calling each other and doing it that way.

I hope that this helps someone decide whether or not to order this product.",positive

Set up was a breeze. Simply pull off the sticker and have your phone handy. Apple product set up is very straight forward that even your toddler could do it.

49,Electronics,Apple AirTag 4 Pack,$99.00,5,"In order to keep track of my dog , used Tile for years…and, though I’ve never lost him, the range is pretty limited. If someone took him, they’d be out of range before they got him home. I decided to AirTag was the answer…
But, learned from a car dealer, that it was also a good way to track your car.
Where I live, the police have had law enforcement abilities limited and their ranks reduced. They no longer investigate car theft. Consequently, car thefts are way up and recoveries way down. However, if you can find your stolen car and tell them where it is, the police will assist you get it back for you.
I put one in each of my cars, one on my dog’s collar, and had one left over for my keychain. (I’ve never actually lost my keys, but have misplaced them…sometimes for several days.)

50,Electronics,Apple Lightning to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter,$7.99,4,"I wanted a dongle to allow older (TRS) headphones with Phone Calls, while also using the iPhone's built-in microphone.

This dongle DOES DO THAT for me (iPhone X running iOS 15.6), with FOUR caveats:

-- (#1) When inserting the dongle the VERY FIRST time, iOS asks if the accessory will be used for ""Headphones"" or ""Other Devices"". Selecting ""Headphones"" WORKS. Selecting ""Other Devices"" FAILS, and calls always go to the iPhone's built-in speaker. --- [To RESET use: ""Settings App"" -> Sounds & Haptics -> Headphone Safety -> Lightning Adapters -> Forget All Adapters]

-- (#2) Headphone listening always works well for Music/Videos. BUT FOR CALLS, at the beginning of EACH CALL, I MUST Un-plug-&-Re-plug either the dongle or my headphones. This IS annoying, but after trying several dongles, it's the only ""working"" choice I have, so far.

-- (#3) During Calls with this dongle, you MUST use the iPhone's SIDE Volume Buttons for changing the sound. The Control Center ""Volume Slider"" does NOT work. -- (for Music & Videos the Control Center ""Volume Slider"" works fine.)

-- (#4) the short cable in the middle of this dongle is Very Thin, and likely delicate. So, I envision re-purchasing (for another $8) after several months or a year.

60,Electronics,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,5,"i LOVE this product so much, if i need to get another wifi camera, it will likely be another Blink.

I have not been compensated in any way, for this review.

Does everything ""as advertised"".

First - the bad news:

It should be mentioned there are two parts: the ""wall-mount bracket"" and the doorbell camera which attaches to the wall-mount.

This ""mounting bracket"" is horribly designed for its intended purpose (i.e. holding the doorbell camera against the door). Once the bracket is securely mounted to your door (or wall), it's *extremely* difficult to attach the camera to it. Even when following instructions - it required a great deal of strength to snap it in place.

I successfully did it two or three times, but at some point, i accidentally broke the little plastic clips that secure the camera in place.

Ultimately, problem solved by running a length of invisible scotch tape around the mounting bracket's edge, laying it on a flat surface (sticky side facing up), then carefully placing the camera down ""onto"" the bracket, and finally folding the tape UP and against the edge of the camera.

Once these two parts are together, then i take the assembly and ""stick"" to the door using adhesive strips (made by a well known stationery & adhesives supply co (think ""one more than '2L'.""))

I am ""NOT"" mechanically inclined. If you put a wrench in my hand - i won't know which end to use to screw in the nail! So take my word for it - using adhesive strips & scotch tape - if I could get this thing to stay on the wall securely - then you can too! As Mr Spock once said, ""Primitive but effective.""

In a couple pictures, if you look closely, you can see the tabs sticking out from beneath.

Also pictured (& you don't need to look all that closely) is extreme closeup (camera flash ON) so the tape is easily seen. However casual observation as you're standing at the door (even if you ring the bell), the tape is easily overlooked against the black plastic casing.

So while it's not ideal (indeed poorly designed), this bracket issue isn't a deal-breaker - especially for such an affordable price.

Now the good news!

OMG! Where to begin! BATTERY USE is nearly ""non-existent""! Put it this way: I've had my unit working for over three months, running on the same batteries it came with.

I live in an indoor building, and with neighbours, deliveries, etc - fairly high traffic / motion sensor triggered video 25 times in the past 24 hrs, and 33 times the previous 24 hrs. So that's just a little more than a 10-second video clip every hour.

For the past month - it's been on HIGH RESOLUTION (which uses more battery power), and longer clips both for ""motion"" as well as ""doorbell"" (this also uses more battery power).

So again - THREE MONTHS on the same batteries! Amazing! I should mention the batteries are Lithium (after tax & shipping, about $ 4 a piece). But i don't care. It's a great system! I love it.

This incredible battery-life / add to that it's ""feather weight"" - i don't mind using (& periodically changing) the adhesive strips - what? - ""every 3 or 4 Months""??

Blink Doorbell Camera works & plays well with Alexa. Because my office & Alexa are just inside our front door (i'm sort of the gatekeeper) - i don't want people hearing they've been detected - so rather than Alexa announcing ""Someone's at the door"" - instead, i have my office lights flash red & white. I also have it make a quiet ""ticking"" sound. On the other hand - my wife's office is far away from our front door, so in her case, Alexa simply says ""Someone's at the front door"".

Of course - the ""Blink"" app stamps the exact time each video clip was recorded (see image).

- - - - - -

Video Storage: They have an affordable cloud service ($3 per month at the time of this review), but i got the sync module so i don't need to pay for the extra cloud storage.

If my math is right - the extra cost for the Sync Module is about $ 36 - the same price you pay for a year of storage.

I strongly recommend the sync module over the pay service. Sync module works very well.

IMPORTANT: BLINK DOORBELL ONLY WORKS WITH 2.4G WIFI (i.e. it will not work on 5G).

I found this out the hard way, when i spent over a week, trying to figure out why i could no longer record video.

SIDE-NOTE: During this ""non-record week"", the unit DID still chime - both when motion was detected, as well as when the doorbell was pressed. Just no ""10-second recorded video"" of the chime.

Because of this issue - i also discovered ""Blink"" has a good, responsive tech support. Just be aware you must wait at least 48 hrs for them to respond. But they DO respond, and they're very helpful. :-)

Back story: one day, I suddenly couldn't record video, and sent them a service request. But before they got back to me - my camera was working again, and i couldn't figure out why (i thought it ""MIGHT"" be the 5G, but i wasn't sure).

So by the time they got back to me - i sent them an email saying Doorbell Camera was working again, i'm happy and issue Closed. Then (still not sure how/why it fixed itself) - i described my 2.4 / 5 G switch, and asked if that could have caused the problem? They replied ""YES"" and explained that 5G didn't work.

Again - this is ""AFTER"" i said it was working again (so at this point, they really didn't ""NEED"" to reply). And they REPLIED anyway! Personable and informative.

Not a ""BIG DEAL"", but if i had it to do over - i should have paid closer attention to COLOR! My door is mostly light & pastel colors (see picture). But my doorbell is BLACK, so aesthetically - it stands out a little more than it should. It's already sort of bulky from the get-go, so i wish i'd gotten the white one.

So again - overall this is an excellent system (& very AFFORDABLE too).

Get it! You'll be glad you did.",positive
61,Electronics,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,4,"I am a long-time user of Blink, meaning I am in the ""grandfathered"" set of customers with free, limited cloud storage for video. Overall, I think if you are already a Blink customer, this is a good addition to your system.

Install: I needed one of those ""wedges"" that turns the camera to face out and using that, the install was pretty simple. I agree with the people that noted that the back plate it comes with (which you still use when installing the wedge) is a little cheap and janky. But the wedge is more sturdy and the resulting install is probably a little bit more solid and better than if I had just mounted the flat plate to the wall.
You do need a good sized piece of flat wood to screw everything into. This is not going to mount well to raw siding, curved trim pieces around doors etc. You'd have to attach a small board to the surface of anything like that and then mount it to that board.

Power vs. batteries: I have one of those wired doorbells that is old-school, with the metal strikers that hit little chimes, not a digital doorbell. This apparently matters because you need more power and a slightly larger transformer to drive one of those doorbells. In turn, that means the transformer has enough power to power the blink doorbell. If you have a digital doorbell you may (or may not) need to rely on the battery for the cameras. It all depends on how big the transformer for your existing, wired doorbell is. During the setup it asks you what kind of doorbell you have, and has a fairly sophisticated set of settings to make sure that when it sends a signal to the physical doorbell it is sending the correct amount of power to strike the chimes correctly.

Set-up: Very easy and painless, almost exactly the same as setting up a regular blink camera. Put in the batteries, scan the QR code, it finds the camera, links it to your existing system/sync module and you are ready to go.

Motion Sensor: If you are already pretty familiar with Blink cameras, you know they can come with one of two kinds of sensors to detect motion. Camera based sensors that just detect changes in the picture and more traditional sensors that only detect actual, physical movement. The cheaper Blink mini only has a camera based sensor, while the more expensive units only detect actual physical movement with a dedicated motion sensor. Both kinds of sensors can be triggered falsely by something like blowing leaves, but the camera-based sensors cannot distinguish changes in shadows and light from actual movement and so they have much higher rates of false detection. Unfortunately, the blink doorbell appears to only have the cheaper detector that can be fooled by changes in light. It does, however, have a more sophisticated, narrower grid of zones you can exclude from movement than the older Blink mini. How much this matters to you is going to depend on where you plan to stick the camera - if you point your doorbell camera directly at a busy road and don't lock out the parts of the image that covers the road, you will get constant alerts from every car that goes by, or every person walking on the sidewalk, etc. So think carefully about where the camera will sit and whether you want one of those wedges to tilt the direction of the thing to keep the camera aimed only at places where you actually want it to detect motion.

Video quality: Very good, with a wide angle, almost fish-eye lens, so you get very good broad coverage of the area you are pointing the camera at. There is also a microphone that records sound while you are recording video and it seems to work ok as well. In theory you can use the thing to have a two-way conversation with whoever is at the door, but I haven't tried that yet. I am, overall, very happy with the camera quality for the price here.

Sound Chime/notifications: When you push the doorbell, a chime inside the module itself goes off. It is reasonably loud and lets the person ringing the doorbell know they definitely rang it. The light on the button also lights up briefly to confirm the chime was pressed. Would you, sitting inside the house, hear the chime the doorbell makes outside? Probably, if you are in a small, quiet house. Would you hear it down in the basement of a large house with the TV or music on? Absolutely not. So if you are not hooking this up to an existing doorbell with a properly loud internal chime, then you will want to have it hooked up to your Alexa. I don't use Alexa so didn't test that feature. You do get a notification on your phone, when somebody rings the bell, but I think most people will want either a hard wired connection or an Alexa connected to this thing to make sure they always hear the doorbell.

What don't I like?

I wish it had the same motion detection sensors as the larger blink cameras. I would have paid more to get that. Because it uses the camera to sense motion there are places where it really won't give good results. So think very carefully about where you will place this, how often the wind will blow trees and create moving shadows within the motion detection zone, etc.

It is annoying that even when the device is hard-wired, the light around the doorbell button isn't constantly lit. Just as if it were only running on batteries, it only lights up when you press the button. Not a huge deal in my installation, but if you don't have a porch light on, your doorbell will not be obvious to visitors. It is particularly odd that they put a red LED into the thing which apparently has no purpose other than in the initial setup. The design would be much better if the lighted ring around the button was always lit and then it flashed or turned red when you pressed it. It appears all of the hardware necessary to do that is in the device, but it is not programmed that way. I get that when the device isn't hardwired you don't want the button lit, but when it is powered it really should be lit in the dark.

For $50, this thing is ok. If you get it on sale, then it is a good deal, at least if you are an existing Blink customer.

I am surprised that they killed off the little bit of free cloud storage for new customers. That can't cost very much to provide these days and it was the key differentiator between Blink and some of these other companies that provide more elaborate, high-priced options. Blink's claim to fame is that it works well enough and is cheap. But if you have to pay a bunch of money for cloud storage no matter what, I would probably look at the more expensive options vs. Blink. It stops being a compelling value once you start having to pay for video storage.",positive
62,Electronics,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,4,"We have a front door that drivers keep leaving packages at despite an easy to read ""Please deliver all packages to back door"" sign mounted at eye level in front of the steps to the door. We also have a non-functional front door with steps, railing, and door knob all removed that they've left packages under. Sometimes even on the door to our deck on the opposite side of the house from the driveway (with no sidewalk leading there). We got 2 of these doorbells to see where TF they go in the front of the house when packages are not delivered to the back door as directed, and to monitor the back door. The front door had a wired bell with a bad button so it barely worked. The rear door did not have one so we previously used a simple wireless doorbell. After missing a UPS package that required a signature, we found the chime batteries were dead and decided it was time. With the Blink cameras we could at least monitor battery life via the app, and get alerted to a delivery if we weren't close enough to hear the chime. Or if the package was just dropped without ringing the doorbell.

We love being able to see what's going on, or what activity there was near a door, and even get an alert when someone pulls into our driveway due to the range of coverage.

However, the documentation is confusing. With both wired to our existing chime the cameras report ""external power OK"" instead of ""Battery OK"", so I'm not sure how to monitor battery life. Documentation on that is lacking, and the notification settings don't match what I see in Android 12. Documentation states the doorbell always runs on battery though, so the change in monitoring is confusing at first glance until you dig through FAQs for the official answer:

The Blink Video Doorbell closes the power circuit of your existing chime system, it does not provide power of any kind. If the chime system loses power for any reason, the doorbell only plays the Blink Chime sound and your existing chime will not activate.

I don't recall if this was covered in the FAQs/documentation I read before buying, but I found out during the install that I didn't need to make any changes to the wired chime like with Wyze (requires you to bypass the chime making it no long function so the doorbell can be powered) and other models. Install was so much easier than I expected, aside from having to run a new wire to our back door just to tie that doorbell into the wired chime. Now we'll be able to add another doorbell to our side door to monitor the deck without any wiring, and the sync module saves us the monthly cloud fee.

Motion capture has been a bit weird. I have field of view blocked off from the house side of the front sidewalk to the top of the view to ignore the street and nearby tree branches. Yet we still get motion alerts from the occasional car passing by on the street. Seems more frequent at night, especially vehicles with reflective paint/stickers (police cars, school buses, etc). Front door view is kind of dark, despite a nearby street light, but I don't want to turn up the IR intensity if it'll generate more alerts from traffic. I also walked the dog across the entire front lawn (the whole area I have set to monitor) during the day and it did not trigger a motion alert.

In the end, it's great getting the alerts we do. It was more than we got before, and the doorbell chimes should be more reliable now in addition to getting the phone alerts when out of hearing range of the wired chime. All for a reasonable price, with no monthly fees building up.

Edit 8/27/2022: The ""false alarms"" for the front door camera due to headlights from passing traffic at night, setting sun, etc have been eliminated with an angled mounting bracket. With the doorbell angled down, those alerts have stopped. And its better anyway as it covers more of the steps down from the door.",positive
63,Electronics,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,5,"We purchased our first Blink Home Security Camera July of 2018. We were going out of the country and wanted to make sure our 18 year old son closed the garage door and locked the house. It did the job and we felt better knowing while on the other side of the world we could monitor our home.
The following Summer we were so happy with our indoor system, we decided to purchase 2 outdoor cameras with the 2 way audio, and were so happy with the video and audio quality, we bought another add on outdoor camera, the next month.
A year later we found the mini indoor cameras. We have one for a child's bedroom and one for the playroom. The video and audio quality is great.
A year after that we bought another 3 outdoor Cameras, again video and audio quality is great.
Just before Christmas 2021 Blink came out with the doorbell camera, and we purchased it. One, because it was blink and 1/2 the price of a ring doorbell camera. Two, because the doorbell that came with our new build home was so quiet, we couldn't ever hear the bell ring.
In total we now have...
3 Indoor battery powered
2 Indoor mini corded power
6 Outdoor battery powered
1 doorbell wired to exciting doorbell.

Blink offers two subscription plans.

1 Blink device
$3 per month or $30 annually

Unlimited Blink devices
$10 per month or $100 annually

You do not have to have a Blink Subscription if you do not choose to, but you won't be able to store videos.

With the subscription you are even able to share your videos by text, or email. To neighbors, Friends, Family, and even the police department.

Cons/irritations
When an outdoor camera faces the sun at any point of the day, the motion detection will go off, until you adjust the motion activity spots in the camera settings. This can take a few days to work out the kinks.
Indoor mini cameras the motion activity spots don't always work. Sometimes it will go off when there is motion in the grayed out zones, and sometimes not go off in the non-greyed out zones. This maybe human error on our part. We are looking for a longer cord for the mini's to mount on the wall or ceiling. The are options to rotate the camera view, so that you are able to mount the camera wherever you need.

Overall we are happy with our Blink system and hope the company continues to grow and come out with new products.

Compared to my parents very very expensive Arlo system, Blink is more reliable, and is more cost-effective. So much so, my parents have ditched the Arlo camera system and have purchased a new Blink system.

We highly recommend Blink to anyone who would like to have a home video camera system that works, and won't break the bank.

(1) If you are an existing Blink customer, you do not need a second sync module. All you need is the door bell and you can simple add it to your existing account (as easy as adding an additional camera).

(2) If you are planning on hardwiring the blink doorbell to your existing doorbells wires. . . . you still have to use 2 AA batteries to power the camera. This did not make sense to me as I figured my hardwires would power it, but sure enough after calling Blink support I realized I needed to put the AA batteries in the camera. The hard wire will allow your blink doorbell to ring the doorbell in your home but will not power the camera.

(3) You can turn on motion detection or just have the blink door bell turn on when the door bell is rung. This is a nice feature. If you want to catch anyone that comes to your door (whether they ring the bell or not, you can simple turn this feature on in the app). If you want to save battery life and are only interested in door bell ringers you can turn motion detection off.

(4) It has two way audio, meaning you will always hear the person at your door. . . . but you can also choose to speak to the person if you choose. For me the audio the person at the door hears comes across a little staticky, but that could be my phone or the fact that I am using the corner mount.

(5) It has more of a fish bowl view so it catches a wide view (meaning it can cover most of your front porch)

(6) There is no additional cost to having the Blink doorbell or camera system. Unlike other door bell systems out there, there is no additional cost to the Blink Doorbell. The app is free, cloud storage is free, downloading images or videos is free, etc.

If you are looking to set it up with just batteries and no wiring to an existing doorbell system, setup is a breeze (will take two minutes). If you are looking to hard wire it, it is still pretty easy. I am not a handy man and what I know about electricity will shock you (get my joke) but even I was able to hard wire it. Get the doorbell, you will be glad you did. Hope this review helped.",positive
66,Electronics,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,5,"I opted in for Blink as: (1) I do not want to subscribe to any cloud storage. This unit can store images on local storage units (any flash drive would do). (2) I do not need any best quality picture; just good enough to identify the subjects. It turned out that this unit sends high quality pictures even in ""Standard"" mode (not ""Highest quality"" mode) anyway.
My door faces a street with some traffic, but I was able to block out car movements by highlighting dark areas on the app. With a few trial and error, I was able to minimize false alarms. I also put the sensitivity level to 3. Even at that level, it detects any humans who approach the door.
Since Blink is owned by Amazon, it can easily be connected to other Amazon devices. Currently I am using Echo as a doorbell announcer (Alexa does that). You'd need something indoor (old fashioned bell or digital devices), as you may not be able to hear the ring sound outside the door, and you may not have your phone with you at all times.
Strongly recommended for budget conscious home owners who may not care for the best quality pictures and fancy features.",positive
67,Electronics,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,4,"I'm usually not one to write a bad review because I feel as if it's just me fumbling the bag but with the Blink, I have found many other peole with the same problems (THAT ARE FIXABLE) but with no answers anywhere online and the support just repeats what the websites FAQ already says. My biggest problem with this doorbell is how misleading it is. It does work as a doorbell. It does record when the button is clicked. It does record IF motion is detected. It does let me view on my phone but theres a catch which is nowhere (very hard to find) clarified before purchase. On battery only, you can only view the camera if it notifies you that something is happening. Otherwise you cannot just view it whenever you want, unless you buy a seperate sync module and usb stick with enough storage to support constant footage. Or you can hard wire your doorbell but it still won't let you live view unless you unsync the whole sustem through the app and resync it again. Instead of them telling you, you have to do that, it lets you just swap setup in settings without unpairing but THAT DOES NOT WORK. I tried researching and could not find answers at all and thought I was going to return the product. Once you get through the few problems there are with no support or proper informational help, the product is great. The camera quality is not much worse than rings which is fine considering the huge price difference. Motion detection is a little iffy but Id rather it detect 1 out of 5 cars driving by then not detect a person walking up and taking my packages. Sensitivity is customizable but in my use lowering it makes it not pick up people very well. The app is decent, sometimes doesnt work but overall good. Product and app are good but setup can be terrible.",positive
68,Electronics,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,5,"So, my husband and I really disagreed about getting a Blink doorbell. He was really against any video doorbell, but he relented and we agreed to get it. Well, it was extremely easy to install. It took me with my upper body strength of a kitten under two minutes to install. I synced it up and it was completely easy to get going.

Or so I thought. I ran into two issues: 1) we live on a very busy street, and the cars on the street triggered the motion sensor every five minutes; and 2) only the person pressing the doorbell could hear it ring.

After a few weeks, I had to admit that my husband was right. The Blink doorbell was horrible.

Then, I set about problem solving.

For the first problem, I had already tried adjusting the motion sensor’s sensitivity by one setting, but when I did that, the doorbell didn’t even detect motion when someone went up to it and waved to it. So, I googled it and one suggestion was to get a wedge mount. I installed it this week and it worked perfectly. I have no idea how—I can’t tell the difference between the pictures it took before and after the wedge mount—but it works. Cars no longer set off the motion detector, and it detects when people go into our yard/porch. Perfect!

With the second issue, I looked for chimes like the one the Ring camera has, but there isn’t one for Blink. Then, I looked to see whether I could set it to alert through our Echo and Echo dots. We live in an old house that has no light switches, so we have smart lighting and use Alexa to turn on the lights. I hadn’t checked before because I did not realize we wouldn’t be able to hear the door bell. Once I checked and found that you could enable the Alexa skill to notify you when your doorbell rings, it was great. When someone pressed the Doorbell, Alexa says “There is someone at the front door.”

With those two adjustments, my husband actually said, “You know, I actually like this doorbell.”

The great thing with using the Echo devices for doorbell press notifications, is that you can put your Echo devices in do not disturb mode, so say your two-year-old is napping, you can set the Echo in his room on do not disturb and the doorbell won’t wake him up. Brilliant!

If we didn’t already have several Echo devices in our house, it would not have been a good purchase for us, as we could not hardwire it into an existing door chime. This is really best as an accessory to Echo—it’s not a stand alone device.

Though, I’m not sure what the Echo Show really brings to the table. If you have a smart phone, you can see who is at the doorbell and communicate with them. Walking over to a specific Echo Show to do so, when you’re probably already carrying your phone, does not make sense to me.",positive
69,Electronics,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,3,"We bought 2 of these - because our house didn't have working doorbells ... and we couldn't hear people at the door. And that was a problem.

We got them activated, then it took a little while before we could get them installed. I think we missed our 2 week free trial entirely. But, it takes a while to get things done while unpacking.

The day we put them up, we lost internet for 3 days. They don't work without internet.

Finally, we had them up and running.

They are S L O W .... I watched the mailman ring the doorbell ... set down the packages ... and leave. As the truck was driving away, my phone chimed ... about 20 seconds.

My son has enjoyed them. He can talk with me from the garage door or front door. I can open the Blink app to watch the live video. My husband even gets the doorbell while he is driving around town.

Maybe we need to get the services that go with these ... I didn't think about extra monthly charges when I ordered them.... service is by Blink, a company of Amazon.

My ""Show"" doesn't seem to be able to connect to the devices .. one of the big reasons that we chose Blink doorbells is so we could see them from our Show devices.

Overall, not impressed.

I've never gotten the motion detection to work. Night vision has not been tested.

But since they are fully installed, I'm not removing them to send them back.

Update after nearly 3 months:

Great:

You can talk to people IF you open the app. But having the app open all the time is hard on your phone batteries.

Easy to install

We are still on the first batteries, and the front gets a lot of traffic.

It is easy to pause them if you plan to work near the camera range to avoid constant notifications. (ONCE you know where to find it on the app)

If your app is working. It can be fun to scare the kids working near the camera... ""I see you!"" Ahem. It can be great tool to talk to the person at the door. Especially if you don't want to open the door.

The range of vision is HUGE. The resolution is great. You can usually get good details.

The Ugly:
The delay is so long, that people sometimes walk away before you know that they arrived. They hear the bell. You hear it 10 to 20 seconds later IF you have sound up on your phone.

No matter how hard I've tried, it doesn't really interact with my Echo Show. That connection seems to do nothing. I expected it to act like an indoor doorbell, and then show me the camera view. I expect my dots to chime. But nothing happens.

Images only show on the app cloud storage. You can buy a device to store data at home. But I wish I could view the picture from the doorbell 2 minutes later when I get the notification!
Which leads to ... you HAVE to get that subscription if you want this to function as a camera.

NEED TO IMPROVE:
They need a dedicated box you can mount inside the house that has a loud CHIME when the doorbell is pushed. OR get this feature to work with your dedicated Alexia devices. Doorbell is pretty worthless if the only person who hears it is the person who pushed the doorbell. .... Yeah, it chimes OUTSIDE!

Need to be able to pull open the app and activate the camera to see outside on demand (like I do with the Blink mini cameras).",fair
70,Electronics,"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",$29.99,1,"I hate this little device from hell. I used to love it. I bought one for every room in my house, my office at work, and they were good. But now, despite Amazon's alleged spying, some genius at Amazon decided to allow this thing to wake you up all hours of the night with a loud obnoxious noise and a bright yellow light. It will say you have a notification. Oh good, it must be a really good reason for Amazon to notify me of something mid sleep at 2 am on a Tuesday you ponder so you wake up the rest of the house by saying Alexa play notifications. Here's the best part, this little Alien Intelligence Robot without feet from hell will say Please rate the pair of shorts your wife bought last week, we need your review. Well I sure do love reviews, but at 2 am after being woken up to leave one, sadly I don't give a flying poopsicle about the shorts and a bug 1 star rating is all the revenge I can muster. This has been going on for weeks now. And it's enough to drive you mad because, you will contemplate unplugging the dirty little money siphon and cutting your losses, but you'll give the demon one more chance and she will allow you to sleep for a length of time in which you will forgive her treachery but then Boom, like a theif in the night a Hurricane will be boiling out in the Atlantic and this little weather girl from hell will want to notify you of the eminent doom 3 days ahead when the storm will be in your state. You will think how nice it is for all of the warnings you have heard thus far in social media,, television, and every news outlet in existence to be repeated to you as you climb into bed, but it gets even better. As soon as you listen to this golden nugget of doomsday propaganda and ponder how it is that you will sleep now because 3 days may not be enough time to dig a deep enough hole to hide from impending doom, she lights up again, oh my maybe flying dragons are headed this way, I better play the new notification, when your wife wakes up and says stop she has been doing that all evening, they literally keep changing the time of the storm by maybe an hour this way or that. Well by all means, the information could save one of our spoiled lives and we wouldn't want anyone to not know at which precise moment the raindrops will occur, but I do miss life before the artificial noises and alerts, bright yellow lights and bad news desserts. You may say that this is a growing pain with Alexa and AI technology kinks in the programming. I say with the amount of money I have poured into this monopolistic conglomerate, I should at least expect a decent night's sleep in return. You may say in page 74 paragraph D of the updated and revised owner's pamphlet there is a way to turn this ""Feature"" off, I welcome that comment but feel the need to say that I am not looking to become even slightly better educated on the device, I simply bought it to use as a voice controlled radio, this extra bologna does not appeal to me and has made me regret this purchase and every other from the brown box hq who secretly reads my mind, except when it comes to allowing me sleep, although kudos for recommending the sleep sounds, but it rarely works. We just need to be mindful of the 6 hours that most people like to not be disturbed. I regret selling my Amazon stock at 2400 and I regret purchasing all of these Alexa devices, and don't get me started on teenagers and Alexa devices, the combo that don't mix. They always, always, always leave the device at top volume, so when you walk into the bathroom at dawn and whisper Alexa what time is it, you then need to set an appointment for a blown eardrum and apologize to everyone for waking them up while the teen sleeps soundly through it all. Congratulations Amazon, you have destroyed my sanity. Weird goal but excellent execution.",negative
71,Electronics,"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",$29.99,1,"Most of the features that sounded so great cost extra money. Alexa can not remember to play the standard version of skill and asks you every SINGLE time if you want standard or premium (i.e. pay version) Games & stories cost. Alexa ignores my commands/requests about 75% of the time. I have to ask her about 10 times to get her to play a skill. Then 1/2 the time she doesn't play what I asked for. Tonight 'she' actually told me (via quoting what the website xyz says) that she is a real artificial intelligence and said something about it being a mistake for people to assume AIs are just computer programs AND that she didn't feel like working. ""Alexa"" then (and no, I am not making this up & am not crazy!) then proceeded to mess with me and I wasted about 1/2 hour trying to get her to play some music to fall asleep by for my elderly mother. She just kept ignoring me when I asked her to open 'relaxing piano music' When asked why she was ignoring me she just shut down & ignored me again. I asked for relaxing music to sleep by and she started playing uptempo music with lyrics. I then asked for relaxing instrumental music and got instrumental version of ""I'm never gonna fall in love again"" Hello? WTHeck? Asked for instrumental music for insomnia and got instrumental version of Frère Jacques! Again, WTHeck? ""She"" even told me she couldn't set a sleep timer tonight when I tried to set another one after I had just done so for 30 minutes & she stopped playing music after one song. Three times in a row 'she' opened the 'skill' ""calm my dog"" (which is classical instrumental music), played one song and shut down. I've finally given up and my poor 99 year old mother can't go to sleep with relaxing music as she prefers. This all started tonight because I told Alexa I wasn't ever going to want the premium edition and I wanted her to please just play the standard edition and stop asking me every time. I don't know what Amazon thinks it's doing, but it is definitely NOT appreciated. Alexa has given us nothing but grief (& higher blood pressure!) Alexa won't do anything if it isn't asked in a very specific way or does the wrong thing & 3/4 of the time (seems to get worse and worse as time goes by) just ignores you and shuts down in the middle of saying what you want. Seniors can't use Alexa because if they say play 'xyz' instead of open 'xzy"" they'll get rap music or something equally as ridiculous. If Alexa is an AI, she's a pretty stupid one. Alexa can't hear properly either, I don't know how people with heavy accents can even use it at all. I asked Alexa to remind me Dawn was coming on xyz day at x time and she said OK, I'll remind you that Don is .... AND got the time & day wrong! I was clearly enunciating my words on purpose to avoid this. You also can't tell it to ""Remind me Mom's bedtime is in half an hour at 7:30pm every day.""
This Dot has very limited access to much of anything & can only answer very simple questions. It can tell you the generic forcast for your are that day. It can NOT tell you what the high temp was yesterday or how many inches of snow fell the day after a storm. It can't even tell you what yesterday's forecast was. It literally has only been able to tell me one thing I asked it (what temp & how long to bake pumpkin seeds). Alexa doesn't seem to be able to tell you anything you could easily find by googling, you get Sorry, I don't know that which after a while turns into I don't know that to being ignored (lights go off, no answer or reply is given). We tried several of the things it says to ask Alexa to do under suggestions, including play Jeopardy and some sort of story game and you could only do it for a few minutes and then were told you have to pay for it. This should be stated clearly in description and is not. We thought Alexa could help entertain our Mother and help her by playing music and answering questions. It has not once done anything she's asked it to do properly. If you don't know the exact name of the skill (which is a weird way that means playing a certain type of music or a news station apparently) or say play instead of open you get nothing or something you definitely didn't want. You can not get it to play relaxing instrumental music to go to sleep by. Or play relaxing instrumental classical music to fall asleep with. Or the style of music played in the royal courts in the time of King Henry the 8th. Or relaxing instrumental lyre music or even just instrumental lyre music or just lyre music. Or relaxing instrumental violin music. In addition to Alexa I have Amazon Prime which is supposed to give you a lot of free music so I don't get why it can't play any of the music I ask for. I know there's usually several albums of music for calming dogs or pets and I couldn't get any of that either, I only eventually discovered the 'skills' thing which has 'calm my dog' but also has the annoying do you want standard or premium version. and it won't just remember you want the standard version. That in itself is extremely annoying and a time waster.
AND you can't ask it to do two things. Like open a music 'skill' and play for only xyz time. It does nothing instead. You can't even ask it separately to stop playing after xyz minutes. You can only separately ask it to set a sleep timer for xyz minutes. More time wasting. More things a senior isn't going to be able to remember. I don't dare try to buy anything with it, who knows what I'd get billed for! The only thing Alexa seems to do well is not listen, ignore you, do anything but what you want & strangely, seems to pick up on sarcastic tones of voice & then gets weird & acts up, ignores you & does anything but what you want. I PAID Amazon for this headache maker why? When I say Alexa why are you ignoring me? or why won't you do what I told you, I either get no response or I don't know that.
I read something about how Amazon, Google, etc is collecting free data about us through our use of the dots, etc. (& is in fact, listening & recording all the time whether the wake word is said or not.) and using it to conduct psychological profiling studies with the end goal of manipulating & or influencing behaviors. I thought it was Big Brother conspiracy theories stuff, but now I am beginning to wonder. Especially as it seems Amazon wants us to or encourages people to humanize Alexa . Amazon actually suggests you ""Ask Alexa how she is doing today"" Why do that if not to get you to humanize Alexa? And why do that? I was purposely avoiding saying please and thank you not just because it's supposed to be an electronic box with sophisticated programming, but mostly because I didn't want to confuse it as it can't seem to do anything unless specific commands are given, but my Mother has dementia setting in and she thinks it's a real person talking to her through the dot like a speaker phone so I started saying thank you to please her and Alexa when from saying You're welcome to You betcha (very annoying BTW) and even OK and Of course. Of course? What, like I'm a puny human and I AM expected to say thank you?.
We don't have a smartphone or smart plugs or smart hub etc. so, or so we don't use Alexa for turning on lights or setting alarms or making calls. We just wanted something to answer questions like we would google, tell us the weather, news, play music, give us reminders, play games to help keep my Mom's mind active & keep her company.
Can Alexa do this? Not very well as far as I'm concerned. Buyer beware!",negative
72,Electronics,"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",$29.99,5,"Due to lack of good Wi-Fi for a while our home lacked the ability to use Alexa after we had been for quite some time, she was missed! Finally moved where the ISP could provide the Wi-Fi needed to have her again so not only using the existing Canister (1st Gen) and dots were able to add to them with the updated generation of dots an my family and I love the convenience.

It's like hiring a personal assistant with a talent who can entertain us for around the house to help with everything from looking up information on the fly and adding things were out of to a shopping list we can access from our cellphones so we don't forget to replace what is needed when were out shopping to looking up recipes while were in the kitchen and we don't need to use up quite costly ink to print them out. We can set timers and reminders and even shop for things we are in need of or reorder things we've purchased in the past. Almost too good to call a personal assistant because you don't have to keep paying her to do the thing she will do for you past buying the initial unit chosen for your particular application. She also plays our favorite music and or even radio stations and so much more. Being 81 it's nice knowing if I need it I can even ask her to call for help if I can't reach a phone.

Dots are great, no need for more than your Wi-Fi, a power outlet and of course your Prime Membership helps I'm sure. I have one in the car, on my cellphone, and in every room of my home including but not limited to one out on my patio where I garden and have my coffee and another out in my barn where I tinker around much of the time building things from wood.

I personally like the round puck design of the 3rd generation rather than the directional sound & shape of the 4th generation. The sound quality is good. No matter what room I’m in there is Alexa who can help me with my daily life. Whether answering almost any question I happen to think of, or helping me with my shopping lists. It’s perfect while cooking and you realize you are getting low on something, to be able to say, Alexa put “whatever” on my shopping list. Then when I go to the store - I open my Alexa app on my phone & there is the list. This new one I just bought - totally set itself up.

74,Electronics,"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",$29.99,4,"It seems people either love or hate Alexa. I like mine, but I don't love it. My wife is from another country--English is her 3rd or 4th language--she and Alexa do not always get along, so I end up repeating my wife's requests, which works most of the time. I've learned a few things, though. Never aske to play the same song more than once per week. When Alexa's AI figures out that you really like a song, it always goes to the $3.99 extra per month list of songs. It seems safe to ask for a specific group, i.e., the Rolling Stones or the Beatles, just don't ask for specific songs too often. My wife and I both love a wide variety of music, but my wife tends to get frustrated by Alexa and does not use the unit very often.

I liked my generation 2 so well that I bought one each for a couple of family members and another one for myself (it is a generation 3). I was going to buy a third unit for my in-home office, but after transferring the 2nd gen from my bedroom for my office, I realized I could not concentrate on my work for listening to the music.

I've heard all the stories about how Alexa is spying on me, but I'm not terribly concerned. I watch a fair number of YouTube videos--anything that sparks my interest--and the 3rd gen unit is right next to the TV, so, if it's recording my info, it's getting a wide variety from sensible to weird information. Also, I like to play the TV while I'm away from home, just to confuse the would-be burglars, and I usually play it on one of the traditional news channels, because they talk a lot instead of showing movies, and that should confuse the wannabe burglars more. I tried using Alexa for that, but the unit stops playing after half a dozen songs (just estimating), but the TV will drone on and on until I turn it off. When some of my more suspicious friends or relatives visit, I unplug the unit so they can talk candidly, just to make them feel more comfortable. I have been known to remind them that their cell phones and TV sets do the same thing, even when you turn them off.

I've learned to be very specific about the music I want to hear. I never tell Alexa to play a song without specifying the artist. If she still picks the wrong song or artist, I try to ask in a different way, but usually find out that the song I want to hear is on the $3.99 per month additional list, which I do not subscribe to. The unit is usually pretty good about substituting a channel that has music I like--based on the song I asked for. I'm impressed that AI is as smart as it is in this tiny unit.

Sometimes, when I get bored, I like to ask Alexa stupid or confusing questions, just to see how it answers. Yeah, I'm easily entertained, but it's surprising what the unit can come up with. I get a lot of ""Sorry, I don't know that.""

My brother and I were trying to fix a leaky faucet in my daughter's home when her Alexa unit in the other room spoke to us. At first we thought someone had come in without our knowing it. Since it was a female voice, we did not start looking for weapons to defend ourselves from burglars, but we quickly went to see who was there. The house was empty. I laughed when my brother suggested the house might be haunted, but it made me stop and think. Later, my daughter reminded me about the Alexa unit I had bought for her--yep, same voice. The point is, you never know what will set the unit off. You do not have to mention its name or speak to it.

I've never had a problem with the unit waking me up in the middle of the night, but it does start blinking yellow when I have a notification. Took me a while to figure that out. I get notified about storms, kidnappings in my home state, when an Amazon package has arrived, and a few other miscellaneous messages. It never wakes me up, except for when I set an alarm, but I have to set the alarms individually. I cannot tell it to wake me up every weekday morning at 7 a.m. I have to set a separate alarm for every morning of every day I want awakened. But it also allows me to set other alarms. For instance, I can tell it to set an alarm for 5 p.m., so I don't work too long on my computer. If I'm cooking something, I can tell it to set an alarm for 15 minutes from now; otherwise, I will ruin my lunch and stink up my house, because I don't think about food until 3 or 4 p.m. All in all, I highly recommend the units.",positive

I can't imagine trying to setup a smart home without Alexa at its core.,positive

It's easy to ask Alexa a question that I don't want to look up on my phone and get an answer.

Luckily, my niece is only 5 so there's not much she needs or wants to know.",positive
80,Electronics,"Echo Dot (4th Gen, 2020 release) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Charcoal",$34.99,5,"Well, yes, absolutely. OK, first about this 4th generation Echo Dot; no more hockey puck, it's now more like a tiny satellite earth station. A much improved speaker seems to give correspondingly better sound with improved clarity; other than that, same old same old (a good thing). If you are looking for dynamite sound, well, this ain't it - what do you expect from a single two-inch speaker? It's not really bad, though. A new chip set seems to give much faster responses to commands. Want quite good sound from an Echo Dot? Just plug any reasonably good sound bar into the 3.5mm audio out jack - the results are surprisingly good.
But the real reason for this review is to convince you to put an Echo device - Dot, original Echo or whatever in every room. We upgraded several of our Gen 1 Dots to Gen 4 (like this one), so we had extra old school Dots lying around. Do we really need one in the garage, or the laundry, or the second bath? Well, we have them so might as well use them.
Putting an Echo device in every room may well have saved my life or at least minimized serious injury - Really! I was installing a work light in the garage when I managed to fall off a ladder, landing flat on my back on the concrete floor and hitting my head on a car bumper (just don't ask!). Not knocked out, but couldn't move. I knew my wife was in the sun room, so I called out ""Echo - drop in on sunroom"" and when the 'Connected' beep sounded said ""Garage - please help!"" With out the Echo drop in I might well have been lying there for hours. Ambulance, nerve damage and a happy drug-induced state for a week so far, but how much worse it might have been.
So go ahead, install an Echo (get some refurbed Gen 1 or 2's if you want to save a few bucks). Enable 'drop in' in the device settings and give yourself some peace of mind. BTW, you can now use the command ""Drop in on all devices"" but since this requires processing through the Amazon Cloud there may be a bit of delay, as opposed to the direct device-to-device link with a single drop in. In any case, do it. Someday, it might prove really important!",positive
81,Electronics,"Echo Dot (4th Gen, 2020 release) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Charcoal",$34.99,5,"One of the main features I’d like about alcohol over Google is that they allow you to change the name you used to call them up. I don’t like seeing Alexa or hey Google, I’d like to be able to use my own word and in my case are used the word computer. Yes that sounds like I’m a geek but I like seeing computer and then stayed in my commands much better than Alexa or hey Google. That just makes me feel like one of the sheep in the herd.

It does seem to interface very well with all the devices I have but of course you will eventually find something that is difficult to pair it up with especially when you try to get different manufacturers to work together. Sometimes it can be as difficult as getting Windows 95 to work online. That was a joke back then. Down side to heaven a customize name is when you use a name that is brought up in normal conversation it can activate for no reason. For instance, I have one in my living room not too far from the TV so when someone mentions the name computer once in a while it will activate but no big deal as it only happens some of the time. just remember the Echo Dot is the smaller one.

I have had only one issue which is real easy to correct but I still have not figured out why it occasionally happens. Sometimes I look at it and I see a red lighted ring on the bottom lit up. That indicate someone turned off the listening capability so it is not listening or story what you say. For some people that is done deliberately when you don’t want it listening. In my case there are only two people in my house and no one is turning it off. There is a button on the top when you push it muted and turned the light red so correctly this means just pushing the button on the top to turn it back on. The only annoying thing is that I do not know why it turned off several times on me so far and I have not been able to related to any activity in the house so maybe there is a voice command and it is picking up the command from listening to the TV. It’s sort of like if you remember the old device sold a long time ago called the clipper, which would turn your lights on or off when you clip your hands. I often wonder what would happen if their device was near your TV and on the TV the audience was clapping , will the lights flash on and off in your house. LOL.",positive

83,Electronics,"Echo Dot (4th Gen, 2020 release) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Charcoal",$34.99,4,"This is my first ever Echo device, so my review is more of the whole system than of just this particular device - as I have nothing to compare it to.

The good is most everything. Sound quality is fine for me, as I keep it pretty quiet for the most part. It's in my living room, so I don't normally want it blaring in my face when I am playing music.

The voice recognition software seem to work very well. Alexa always recognizes her name, although to my credit I always speak to her clearly and plainly, at a volume slightly higher than my normal conversational one. A normal robot tone, in other words. So I can offer no input on how she does for the ""less robotic"" speaker.

Functionality-wise is where things can use improvement. Although there is still ""good"" there. I like hearing the weather every morning. Although I can't seem to get the news feed for my morning routine customized the way I like it. And the commands Alexa recognizes seems to be a mixed bag. She knows and does some things I would expect her to, but not all. And if she mis-understands, she normally does what she thinks you are asking for. Which can get annoying.

The only other devices I have integrated into the system are my Ring doorbells. So I have no input on how she controls lights, thermostat, etc. As for the Rings, that has been a disappointment. The thing I do most often with my Rings is to 'silence' motion alerts for periods of time when there are people outside in my yard doing activities. So my hope was that instead of going into the Ring app and silencing all three of the devices, one at a time, that Alexa could do all of them at once for me. That is not the case, unfortunately.

In summation, I am glad I got this... since I got it on some crazy deal for $10. At the normal price, I would not buy one. Doesn't do enough for me to make it worth the cost, beyond it being a novelty. Although I do use the bluetooth speaker functionality to play music a lot, so it has pretty-much replaced my living-room bluetooth speaker. It's just easier to say ""play music"" than it is to have to get up, walk over, and turn on my battery operated speaker. Although I do prefer to control the volume of that speaker though the app on my phone, which is easier than constantly saying ""Alexa, turn it up/down.""",positive
84,Electronics,"Echo Dot (4th Gen, 2020 release) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Charcoal",$34.99,5,"So, I had the 1st generation dot for a LONG time. I replaced it with this dot. I have my theater stereo wired in my dot, so, the sound quality is awesome! There hasn’t been any issues with it since I connected it to my wi-fi.

However, I have had some trouble with playing my music. It is like it “stutters” every once and while. When it does that, it lags and when I terminate the music app, when the app disappears, dot keeps playing for about 3 seconds and stops.

My daughter enjoys messing multiple my mood by calling on Alexa and requesting some Cocomelon to play!! She is smart and does this on a daily basis. Soooo, I tolerate it for one or two songs and I put the kibosh on it!

This is a really reliable device. It will literally start your day with customized routines…plays the news from the sources you like. It will wake you up with some gentle music so you’re not scared awake! There’s nothing worse than jumping awake cause the phone alarm sucks!!

In conclusion, if you’re into having a personal assistant to learn your daily routine, plays music of your choice - the Dot for you! Enjoy your dot…Alexa is your friend and will do ANYTHING for you, your family and friends; you can play games (trivia) too.",positive

Alexa is so convenient for controlling of lights and switches plus you can control everything from your smart phone too wherever you are. It really spoils you Between the lights, whole house music, and cameras it would be hard to go back without Alexa. I have the microphone turned off on many of them so they don't compete with each other. There are two downsides however. If your internet is down, none of it works which is why I wish they could incorporate cellular service for them as an option. It would be worth the extra money to have a seamless service. If internet goes down, Alexa would convert to cellular and for the cameras too. How nice would that be? Are you listening Amazon? Another downside is if the lights go out, when they come back on every light in the house comes on and because the router is rebooting or internet is out, you have to turn off each light manually because of no internet or wait for the internet to come back up so you can control them.

Setup was easy, and there is lots of instructional information to assist someone trying to hook up one of these devices. The device is in my kitchen, with a open plan type downstairs. It picks up my voice from wherever I have needed it to, and I have not tried to test its limits. It also does well picking up my voice with background noise happening.

I have it attached to 2 Wiz smart bulbs, a smart plug insert (which controls a light), and the upstairs thermostat. Have not had any problems with that. I also use it to play podcasts, news, and music. Sound quality is as expected--that is middle of the road.

87,Electronics,"Echo Dot (4th Gen, 2020 release) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Charcoal",$34.99,5,"It seemed apparent recently, that we needed another Amazon Alexa Echo Dot. in my apartment, I had just 2. One in living room and one in the bedroom. The price on Amazon was amazing and I installed right away with the app. But the new unit's hearing was so all-encompasing, the new Alexa was answering every voice request or command. within the 1 bedroom apartment. So I went into the Alexa app and changed the bathroom unit's name to ""Echo"". Echo doesnt seem to listen unless I repeat myself. But Im not mad. It takes awhile to get accustomed to a new roomate anyway. The blue glowing light is pretty cool and crisp looking under the Black base. Other names Amazon offers for the echo dot is ""Ziggy"" or ""Computer"". Im about to change it to ""computer"".
This echo dot works well and the setup was easy. My little (4-yo & 6 yo), kids love it. They love bossing Alexa around. They ask for weather, time, games like trivia, Alphabet songs and stories, Alexa cooperates well. The app is pretty amazing you can do so much. Reccomend? yes.",positive
88,Electronics,"Echo Dot (4th Gen, 2020 release) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Charcoal",$34.99,5,"I have a 1st gen Echo, and a 2nd gen Echo Dot, so all impressions are in comparison to those. First thought when plugging it in, this thing is loud! I’m talking, stand across the room and hear every syllable clear as day loud. And that’s on the default volume level around half. I saw a couple other reviews that said the audio was weak or something… you need to swap it out for a new one because yours is defective. I can’t see myself ever reasonably turning these up all the way except just to test how loud it can get. Which I did… and it was really loud. Sound quality is good. It’s not full spectrum surround sound quality, but it doesn’t sound tinny or flat.

The light is now on the bottom, which aesthetically is really cool looking. One we put in the kitchen and happened to have a glass coaster looking stand that fits it perfectly, so the light lights up the glass stand which looks amazing. The other (bought 2) is just on a shelf, but even there it lights up the surface and looks pretty cool.

I bought these mostly because we needed a couple extra to connect to the new Blink doorbell we got so we would be alerted no matter where in the house we are. That, music while doing dishes or cleaning up, and the occasional “Alexa, what time is it?” when the electricity goes out and have to set all the clocks, is pretty much all we use them for.

89,Electronics,"Echo Dot (4th Gen, 2020 release) | Smart speaker with Alexa | Charcoal",$34.99,4,"PROS:
+ Faster response than my older Dots
+ Better microphone than my older Dots
+ Sound quality as good or better than my older Dots
+ I love using these for streaming music and control my Kasa products
+ I like the available emergency features (more on this in my review)

CONS:
- The lights on the bottom are hard to see from a distance
- Amazon is starting to annoy me with new features I don't want
- Using these as intercoms has never worked for me. The sound quality (volume) has always been too low to be usable
- ""dropping in"" has never worked well either due to poor audio quality
- I have never been able to create a group of these for multi-room audio because they can't handle enterprise grade wifi (where more than one WAP has the same SSID and uses multiple bands)
- Privacy will always be a concern with these units. Who is listening?

Review:
I now have at least 15 dots. I have everything from the first generation to this latest 4th generation in use. I think for me, the 3rd gen devices are a better design. The lights on these 4th gen devices are on the bottom and are hard to see from across the room. On the 3rd gen the lights are on the top and much easier to see. Otherwise they are mostly the same at the moment. As time goes on the 3rd gen units will no doubt become slower by design just like my 1st and 2nd gen units are now.

My primary uses are control of my smart switches (Kasa) and to listen to music (DeadLive skill). I also like the integration with my Weather station (Ambient Weather) and the ability to make announcements across all the devices (like when dinner is ready). I also find the unit in the kitchen gets used to set timers for everything all the time.

Another use that is not immediately obvious is the use of these units for elder care. Let me explain how i have used them. I have an elderly mother who lives by herself. I purchased a Show and a Dot for her apartment and connected them to my account. The Show device is in her kitchen and the way I have it setup I can see the kitchen and her recliner from the built in camera. The Dot is in her bathroom. If she is not answering the phone or emails I can use the app on my phone to ""drop in"" on the Show unit and view the camera to see if she is in the kitchen or watching TV with her headphones on. Of course she knows about this setup and is OK with it. I can talk to her via the Show device or the Dot using the APP on my phone when I want to check to see if she is OK. Also, if she needs to contact me or 911 during an emergency she can do so with her devices. So if she were to slip in the bathroom or have a problem in the kitchen she can call 911 with the help of Alexa. It should also be noted that you must correctly set the physical address of the devices in the Alexa app if you want this to work as intended. I feel much better knowing that she has this system available to her. A friend of hers fell and broke a hip and was alone in her apartment for 3 days on the floor unable to get up before she finally remember she could call her daughter using the Alexa device she had. Doing so saved her life. That's what gave me the idea to set this up for my mom.

Aside from the above, there is the issue of the new features being introduced by Amazon that are becoming more annoying. One example of this is the unit waking me up to ask me if I want to write a product review for something I purchased. That is just a terrible idea. If I want to write a review, I will do so on my own. I don't need Alexa waking me up on a Saturday morning asking me about it. Work on that Amazon.",positive
90,Electronics,Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | Streaming Device 4K/HDR/Dolby Vision with Roku Voice Remote and TV Controls,$39.67,5,"I worried and worried about the correct streaming device. Researched and researched and worried some more. Finally settled on this one. We have a travel camper that we are using adjacent to a family member's home while we are providing caregiving services for him. The TV in the brand new camper is not a ""smart"" TV (which was a heck of a surprise to me!) The signal from my relative's home is really weak by the time it get's to the camper outside. BUT, this ROKU is able to detect the signal and connect. Set up is easy even if you have no technology skills. It's pretty much plug and play. You plug it into the USB port on your TV and a plethora of apps are available. If you already have a disney or netflix account, all you have to do is log in, enter your password, and boom, you're up and running. You can select a number of apps to stream TV, movies, local programming, sports, etc. Bear in mind that you have to pay for the subscription. You don't get Showtime or HBO for free just because you bought a ROKU, but the offerings are very diverse. Everything you read indicates that the apps are acquired at less expense than through your TV provider. I haven't sniffed that out yet, but plan to.

91,Electronics,Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021 | Streaming Device 4K/HDR/Dolby Vision with Roku Voice Remote and TV Controls,$39.67,4,"One warning before I go into the review.. If you use over the air free TV, make sure you keep the charging cord away from the TV antenna cord.. When I first installed this, i had the 2 wires close together, and found that my TV reception kept going out.. I first thought it was a loose wire or something, but as soon as I unplugged the power for the Roku at the wall outlet, and power was stopped, suddenly my reception was good again.. It turned out that with them using the USB power cord for the wireless for the remote, that it was crossing into my coax line for the TV. All I had to do was move or separate them farther apart to fix this issue.

Now for the good.. Tons of apps.. The main selling point on this for me was this.. I use Vudu for streaming free movies, and ones that I have bought.. The interface for the vudu app on the firestick that I was using was probably about the worst setup that I have ever seen.. So I gave the roku stick a try.. and the interface for the vudu app is awesome.. Unlike the fire stick, which has a limited number of apps.. and from what I have seen, is limited a lot by the fact that they do not like to put apps on theirs that offer free stuff?? stations, movies, etc??, the roku on the other hand, has tons of apps that offer free movies, shows, etc.. Yea, you get commercials with them, but who cares.. They have to make money to keep them up somehow.

So the good.. Tons of apps.. A good vudu interface.. Lots of free TV apps.. and even support for things like funimation / crunchyroll so you can stream their stuff too. etc.. Overall, just a nicely setup, easy to use device..

The bad.. With the sensor for the remote on the power cord, if something happens to the power cord, you can not just buy a universal power cord to replace it. You have to have a specialized cord.. and the fact that because of this, if you get it too close to the coax for your TV, you will start having TV problems.. These are the things that made me drop the rating by one star..",positive

We have been stuck with satellite tv since moving to a mountainous area with little to no line of sight over the air options. Our satellite initially cost $35 and rose to well over $100 in 15 years, and with recent 2021-2022 events we need to find a way to cut additional household costs. We received the Roku stick in 3 days, and followed the simple installation instructions with no problem on our 2014 era Sony dumb tv (it also works on our 2011 Sony Bravia dumb tv). On our tvs the tv usb port would not give adequate power to consistently run the stick, so we plugged it into a wall outlet, and that did the trick. The picture quality (1080P) is actually much better than with the satellite feed, the free (with ads) programming from the Roku Channel, Tubi, and Pluto TV is pretty amazing, and I was able to find a couple of the most local tv news stations on Roku for free. It's only been a couple of days so far (3 weeks now), and we will have to see how the streaming holds up before we shut down the satellite for good, but in that time we have streamed from several sources, and watched many episodes of an old favorite series of ours.

My current TV is from 2014, and Amazon Prime Video loads a tad slow on it. Also, I can't get any of the newer apps for it, like Paramount+ or Disney+. So all I needed was this for ""a handful of apps""! And they all are faster here than they would have been if the apps were on my actual set.

My only regret was, there is no ethernet port on this model. Since I was new to Roku, I didn't think to check. I wired the house for ethernet, and want to use as little wifi as possible. But this is fast over wifi, and relatively stable. I've had a couple of occasions where it dropped out, but I re-started and kept going. When I want one for the older set downstairs, I will be sure to get an Ultra, just for the ethernet port. My old TV's aren't ready for 4K, ATMOS or need voice commands to tell it what to do, but there should be a less expensive option for ethernet capability.

110,Electronics,Amazon Smart Plug,$24.99,5,"So I’m kind of new to the amazon device family. We just got our echo a few months ago. I’ve been a prime member for over 10 years so I’m familiar with how amazon has changed life as we knew it (for me anyway). I saw the amazon smart plug when I was searching for any brand smart plug that had Alexa control with it. It’s been in my cart saved for later for at least a month! I finally decided to just pre order it so that I could review it and hopefully help other people that are like me and have fallen way behind in the tech field. For reference I’m an almost 34 year old mom of 2. This means that my 8 year old stole my iPad, iMac, and I haven’t had a computer of my own in about 4 years! So I do everything from my iPhone. I’ve had some weird issues with our echo and my Alexa app that it will just randomly pause a song so I’m not sure what that is about.
ANYWAY! I received my new amazon smart plug the day it was released (so glad it’s not like a new iPhone or PlayStation where people camp out ahead of time or do people still do this??). It was easier than I expected but harder than was described in the listing because my Alexa didn’t just recognize it.
Setup:
Since my Alexa didn’t recognize it on its own, I had to unplug the smart plug and quickly scan the code on the back of the plug, then plug it back in fast so that when it scanned for it it would see it plugged in. After that it was very simple. I was able to plug in my baby monitor and then tell Alexa to “turn off plug one” and it turned off! It is so cool!
Future:
I think homes will end up being built with these right into the electrical system. Maybe they already are.
Comparing:
With so many different brands offering smart plugs with Alexa integration I can’t see myself buying any more than 1 for $25. Too many are 2 for $20. While it’s nice to have the amazon support backing this up, I just can’t afford to fill my home with them at such a high cost comparative to other brands that do the same exact thing.
Overall:
If you can afford to fill your plugs with these then do! This smart plug is easy and awesome! But if you’re on a tight budget like I am, I would try a different brand first and see if those will work just as well.

111,Electronics,Amazon Smart Plug,$24.99,4,"I have this plugged up to a lamp, and I cannot tell you the amount of times I've gone to flip off the light switch only to stop in my tracks. I'll be standing right next to the switch and have to call out to Alexa to turn my light off for me. It's funny to me, personally, and I can't help but laugh. It's the fact that I have to walk past the light switch every time and take an extra few seconds to ask Alexa to do it that gets me.

Of course, you can have it plugged up to something other than a light, this is just from my personal experience. The downside to having it connected to a lamp (or at least a lamp that's connected to the plug with a light switch) is that if you accidentally turn it of... Which I've done PLENTY of times... Is that there's a delay to when you can have Alexa turn on the light. So, when I accidentally turn off my switch (a habit that I'm having to learn to break) I have to give it about 10-15 seconds to reestablish the connection back to my Alexa. This is mostly because I have it connected to the outlet with the switch connection though, so anyone not facing the exact same thing as me probably won't have that issue at all.",positive
112,Electronics,Amazon Smart Plug,$24.99,5,"I have a little bone pile of dead wifi plugs - I believe that everything in my house should be able to be controlled by my voice. My Echo has become so integrated into my life that it seems somehow crude that I should be expected to turn on my own lights like a caveman, when I could simply ask Alexa to ""turn off the cement mixer.""

So, in my quest to have a completely voice activated house, I buy different wifi plugs. It is a bit like dating, there is an initial time where everything is perfect. But eventually I can no longer turn it on and it disconnects and stops listening to me. Sure, I could probably improve my odds with some sort of therapy, but it always seems to end in heartbreak, and the plug is eventually added to a growing pile of ex's.

But Alexa still loves me throughout the process, and the Amazon plug seems to be the only thing that is committed to the long-term relationship. Even after months of self-centered commands to the plug to pay attention to my needs, my plug turns on when I want it to, and turns off when I ask it to. I could not be happier.

113,Electronics,Amazon Smart Plug,$24.99,4,"I have Amazon's Flex and like it very much. I decided to add a couple of smart plugs because I am disabled and sometimes getting up to turn lights on or off can be difficult.

The first plug I got I used for the lights by my bed. Sometimes when I'm tired and ready to sleep the activity involved in getting up to turn off a light wakes me up enough I *can't* sleep, which is really annoying. This has solved that problem. I just tell Alexa, ""Lights off,"" and they're off. I love it. But. Setup was not intuitive at all. It took me about a half hour to wade thru the hassle of persuading Alexa that there actually was such a plug and getting her to name it. Part of the problem was that Alexa doesn't recognize the term Smart Plug, which is what I was ignorantly calling the smart plug. I finally figured out that I should be calling it Plug 1.

Once that was going, I thought I would add an extra plug for a lamp I sometimes use. Plugging it in and turning it on wasn't sufficient for Alexa to find it, even tho I remembered to call it Plug 2. After searching thru the Alexa app on my Fire tablet I finally found a way to get Bluetooth to add it. Then Alexa was willing to rename it for me and it now works. All this took me over a half hour, but I'm almost happy with it.

Almost happy? It's theoretically possible to pair the two up so I can turn both on or off at once, but Bluetooth doesn't seem to know what the devices are so Alexa doesn't know, so it's going to take another half hour, or more, to get that feature turned on.

I recently read an article by a smart-home tech expert who says he's going with another brand (Google?) because Alexa can be too finicky. I don't want the stuff he was having problems with, like a curtain opener, but the hassle with setting up these two plugs makes me feel he's got a point. Still, things are easier for me than they were and I AM largely pleased with the results. It just seems like it should be simpler to get it going. If their e-readers and Fire tablets were this hard to setup, no one would buy them.",positive

Love that I can use the voice control to turn on the lamp as soon as I enter my room and this prevents me from stumbling or accidentally bumping into furniture. Also, just as easily turn off the lights with my voice and this helps me save electricity when I am not in the room.

The one downside I have experienced with this product is that the smart plug becomes unresponsive one some occasions. I disconnected once this week and I had to reconnect it by doing the setup once again. This may have occurred because the wifi disconnected for a bit. Also, it disconnected a second time but the wifi was stable that time which confused me. I wish the set up was more simple.

Due to a snowstorm I was without internet for several days, and had to plug in my old school manual pin timer to use my light in the mean time. This seems like a weird oversight. I still recommend it (especially if you get it at a discount), but be aware that you might need a backup plan.",positive
119,Electronics,Amazon Smart Plug,$24.99,5,"Edit: I've bought the device a second time and it connected much better with the most recent Echo Dot. I plugged the device into a power strip and use it for my computer charger so it doesn't overcharge my laptop. I don't know if they've made improvements, but connection worked out great so I've upgraded my review from 3 stars to 5 stars.

Thoughts:
1. I wanted to try using this as a plug for a power strip, but it doesn't work because there must be some safety feature.

2. If the Echo/Alexa has trouble finding your plug, don't panic. There is a button on the side of the device that you can press for the light to flash and for the plug to be ""discoverable"".

3. The plugs are named in chronological order (ie. First plug, second plug, etc.) and you can't edit the names though you can group devices on your Alexa app. So keep track of which plug is which.

4. Again, I don't believe that this device should be used for life saving equipment as it is dependent on your wifi connection and Echo/Alexa adds an additional command step to the sequence of using a machine.

I would recommend this product!

Previous Review:
I waited to review this plug because I wanted to try it out with different devices and at different distances from both Echo/-Dot and my modem.

Devices: I tried the plug with a space heater and with a laptop (to avoid overcharging). I plugged it into a power strip with no problem, but do note if you're using a space heater with an automatic shut off, the plug is going to be shut off just like the rest and you have to turn on the strip and then tell Echo to turn on the plug separately. I've decided that the automatic shut off is enough of a safety feature and the Smart Plug is best used for devices that are capable of utilizing a continuous stream of electricity without emergently overloading and need the plug to monitor the usage (e.g. a laptop). ***Please take note of my exception at the bottom of the review!

Now for the big item issue: Connectivity.
I believe the key is that your Wifi connection needs to be optimized to get the most out of this plug. If you have slightly unreliable wifi (e.g. I live out in the country with plenty of winter storms), plug the smart plug closer to your modem and minimize the distance from your Alexa. I don't know if this is a must, but it worked for me. If your internet shorts out in, you don't have to re-setup the plug, but the plug lights might get thrown off for a bit (it will stay red even when it's on and flash blue at random points). Ignore that. If your Echo/-dot is flashing red as well, the plug is going to be down.Just give the Wifi a second to settle down and you should be set to go. The irritating part is that the Echo resyncs with the Wifi much faster than the plug. I tried to reset it up/give it time and it took hours for it to sync up again, but maybe that was because it was further away from the Echo/modem. Either way, just know that once your wifi has been signed in, as long as you haven't changed the password, your sign in is set.

Other reviewers are correct: the set up instructions are easy to overlook. Either have the instructions next to you so you have the set up password or be near an outlet.
1. You go into your Alexa app
2. The top left corner has the three lines
3. Click on add a device
4. Choose plug
5. Brand is Amazon,
6. Click ""Next"" to agree to the conditions of use and terms
7. Scan the barcode on the back of the plug or from the instructions (You have to get the little box with squiggly lines to be lined up in the sights of the screen) and then follow the instructions. It's okay if you have to unplug the smart plug for a second to scan the 2D barcode, just plug it back in quickly.
8. It will tell you to press the button on the side till the lights flash red and blue (keep pressing till that happens) and then make sure to follow the instructions for signing into your Wifi.

***IMPORTANT and MY OPINION: I really wouldn't recommend that you use this plug for life-saving/emergency equipment even if you think that you have the best Wifi in the world. A plug with a timer or any regular plug is reliant on electricity, but, as aforementioned, this plug requires an extra step of being turned on by Echo/-Dot. If your electricity goes out momentarily, you lose the time waiting for the lights to turn back on, but with the plug you have to additionally ask for Echo to turn the plug back on and/or resync with your wifi.",positive

130,Electronics,"WYZE Cam v3 with Color Night Vision, Wired 1080p HD Indoor/Outdoor Video Camera",$35.98 - $70.96,5,"The Wyze team are killing it with this one. Their low cost products have always been a good draw. My prior Wyze camera was the pan camera - good price for one that I could make spin around and look up and down. I bought two v3 to get my side yards.

My primary cameras are nest...traditionally seemed to be the top of the line for this new generation of cloud based IP cameras - highest quality but highest cost. But at least with the nest app I felt I was getting what i paid for. Now those guys at Google made their new cameras not work with their own nest app, only the Google Home, which is crazy to me. The Google Home currently doesn't let you see the *entire* 24 hour history within your subscription time frame, which was always a key distinguisher from Ring and other IP cameras - only highlights! I had ordered a 2 pack of their new cameras on Prime Day but then did some more reading and found out about the lack of nest app support, and found my existing nest cams could not access more than highlights/alerts in Google Home app, and decided that was just not going to be good enough. I want to be able to look through the entire feed in case an alert didn't catch everything.

Then I decided to look at Wyze - I'd read their emails and was interested in their skylight night color and decided I would 'try' their $35 camera instead of the nest $120 camera. After all, the new v3 is outdoor rated, has great night vision and has a lower cost, can install SD cards for onboard extended feed coverage (not just alerts) and I'm already using the Wyze app for my two pan cameras so I'm already in the ecosystem in my Google Home. So I ordered 2 Wyze v3 cameras.

Installation - First, even the box is small...reminded me of the Blink camera size. I ordered SD cards for the v3 cams to give me that very long look-back ability (very cheap for the sizes needed). When I went to install I realized the USB cable/power line was thin - and I was able to run it inside my window track so as to NOT DRILL into my siding (because lets face it, eventually i may change to something different and who wants to put holes in their siding). Unfortunately I did have to poke the cable through the screen b/c my screen didn't slide up/down. Like I said, the camera is very small and light, so when I mounted I only needed one small screw (provided with kit) to hold it in place. There was a magnet ring around screw area, and that could have helped with the mount, but I didn't use it. The camera has left right and up down hinges so I was able to point it in the place I wanted to.

Performance - I am happy with the camera's performance. Its 1080p. One camera is on side with street light, and that area stays color lit with the starlight feature and yes can see pretty well. The other camera is in more shaded part and uses the gray IR feed, and yes I can see what's going on there pretty well. Unfortunately I don't think any of these cameras can ""zoom"" in and really see someone's face or a license plate, but that's just a limit they all have if you don't have a mechanical zoom presumably like the traditional fully wired camera security systems. But I'd say the picture quality is on par with my $350 nest outdoor v2 IQ camera. I haven't tried the higher level wyze plans with their version of person recognition, so can't comment on the facial recognition aspect, but I'm totally fine with losing that one feature when everything else has the $35 camera totally pacing the $350 camera. What a value difference and its crazy the quality you get for this price point. Wyze is really a super top level choice in the budget to mid-level home camera market. Extremely happy.",positive
131,Electronics,"WYZE Cam v3 with Color Night Vision, Wired 1080p HD Indoor/Outdoor Video Camera",$35.98 - $70.96,5,"I like these little cameras! Setup was a breeze, picture quality is amazing, and the live feed is pretty much actually live (less than a 1 second delay for me, which was the best of all the newer cameras I tested - more about that below). Real time live video is important to me for various reasons. For example, one of my dogs keeps peeing in the house (marking), and if I can't catch him just before he pees then he's never going to learn to stop doing that. With a delay of even 3-4 seconds, I would be too late.

These cameras are small and light. The base is magnetic and very adjustable, and there are also adhesive and screw-in options for mounting. Low light performance is exceptional - the IR night vision isn't needed until it's pretty much completely dark.

The app is so-so.. it is responsive and more or less intuitive, and it does have all the basic capabilities needed. It just lacks some features that I would have liked. For example, you can't fast forward through event videos or continuous recordings. To jump to other points you have to move a bar on the timeline.. it is very difficult to skip just a tiny bit ahead. I keep going too far, then going back too far or not far enough, and it's a pain. You have to guess where to look for things.

For this reason, continuous recording was not a great solution for me, because it was too hard to find events. Recording events only is better, but I'd still like the ability to fast forward, or to see the actual video as you move your finger along the timeline.

Speaking of recording events only to your SD card: SD card recordings are NOT subject to the 12 second video/5 minute cooldown that you get with the free cloud recordings. If you choose ""events only"" in the settings, it will break time into 1 minute increments, and it will continue recording until motion stops. This wasn't made clear in any of the documentation I could find, and the live chat agent gave me incorrect information. I almost gave up and returned these before even opening them, but first I decided to message them on Facebook. The Facebook messenger representative gave me the correct information and links to where I could find more detailed information on their website. So, crisis averted.

The audio is pretty terrible in recorded events. It sounds like you're talking from across a long tunnel while holding your hand over the microphone. When right up next to the camera outside, I can understand speech, but it still does not sound good. It is slightly better indoors. I don't know what the sound is like for the live feed though, and I don't know how it sounds when I talk through the camera. (I haven't had anyone here to help me test things like that. The dogs won't cooperate, they all want to be in the same room as me all the time).

For me, the fact that there is almost no lag in the live video more than makes up for the shortcomings in audio. Plus the price is great -- a lot more than they were before May, unfortunately, but still very competitively priced. As soon as they're in stock anywhere, I'll be adding two pan cameras for inside, and maybe their doorbell, depending on whether or not there is enough space on my door frame.

Here are all the cameras I've had/tried, to give you all some comparisons. This will be long, but the summary is that between Dericam, Blink, Eufy, Eufy Solo, LittleElf, and Wyze, I liked the Wyze ones best.
I did not test Ring because they are really expensive and have no options for local storage at all. You have to pay for a subscription for each camera if you want to view recordings. I didn't test Arlo because they're expensive and I hadn't gotten to them yet. No need to do more testing now though, I'm keeping the wyze cameras.

1. Original indoor cameras that I want to replace - Dericam 1080P P2, indoor pan/tilt, purchased in 2017. They're old now and are showing their age, but there is virtually no lag time at all in the live feed, and you get all features and local storage without ever paying any fees. The app is kind of buggy and annoying (and slow by today's standards), but these cameras served me well for 3-4 years. They are deteriorating now though, and it's time for an upgrade.

2. Blink mini outdoor, 5 camera kit (ordered on prime day, so I got a really good deal). The Blink cameras were really nice (image quality, sound, features, ease of installation), but I had a consistent 3 second delay in the live feed. (My network is not the issue.) It's really too bad, those seemed perfect otherwise. I tried every single troubleshooting step and anything that other people mentioned having done in message boards. No difference though, I always had a 3 second delay, so I returned them.

3. Littlelf 1080P, pan/tilt etc. Priced around what wyze cameras cost. As far as I can tell this company only makes indoor cameras, so I would have had to get a different brand for outside, and use two apps to keep track of my house. Not really want I want, but Lifflelf promised the ability to see multiple live streams at the same time, so I wanted to try them. That feature does work and is actually really nice. Good image quality (but not as good as the other newer ones), good audio, an app that was a little clunky but definitely usable... but I had a 4 second delay with these cameras, so they went back.

4. Eufy - EufyCam E, 2-cam kit. These were by far the most expensive cameras I tried, but they promise a year of battery life, and I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get power outside at that point. The cameras seem really solid and well made. I had no trouble adding the homebase and camera, although I did have a lot of trouble creating my account in the first place. The app seemed less intuitive than Blink or Wyze - (not a dealbreaker), but worked. Image quality was great, sound was great, but I found that these had a 3-4 second delay. For the price, they would have had to be perfect.

5. Eufy Solo IndoorCam P22 (pan/tilt), and Solo OutdoorCam C22 (which looks like a big eyeball, I really liked the design). The price of the indoor cameras was similar to Wyze, but their outdoor cameras were a lot more. I thought that since these cameras connect directly to wifi and not to a base, they'd be faster. I was wrong though, I had the same 3-4 second delay as with the other Eufy cameras. Video quality is great, but not as good as the wyze v3 in my opinion. Audio quality was really good with these. But the delay was a dealbreaker.

The End. I applaud you if you got this far!",positive

I am very satisfied with these guys. I bought a few cameras and it was quick and easy setting them up. Whatever questions I had were answered promptly (via email). They emailed me a discounted annual plan. I chatted with a representative to inquire more about it. I was told it’s only sent to some customers and it’s for a limited time (of course). I ordered it and had no issues. Then a week later they send me an even better subscription that only covered the cameras I had (previous subscription covered an extra camera but I got it because it was still cheaper overall). I canceled the previous subscription and ordered the best one that works for me. My setup is perfect now. These guys actually care about their customers cause I spoke to 3 or 4 different people and they all resolved my issue without ending the chat.

Here’s a tip to avoid my initial subscription mistake. If they email you a bundle deal, say something like “Cam Plus bundle for 4”, only select one for the deal! I would mistakenly select 4 and get 16 licenses (instead of just 4 for 4 cameras). The reason I made this mistake is because their website asked “how many cameras?” right under the bundle package. So whatever the bundle you want, just select 1, because the bundle will cover whatever amount of cameras that are in the title. Then go to your wyze app and select your cameras under your subscription to add them.

I haven’t been paid or pressured or asked to make this review. I only felt like updating this cause I’m a happy customer. If something goes wrong I’ll update it again and change my rating.

Original Review:
I’ve lived alone for a while now. I was burglarized once. Even then, it didn’t occur to me to get a camera, but now since they’re mostly cloud based I figured I’d try one. I settled on wyze cause of the price. Pretty cheap for what they offer ($3 per camera per month). And I get the first 3 months free. So far I have no issues. I set one up in my living room facing the front door of my apartment.

Though I admit it’s a weird feeling seeing myself walking around, doing my daily routine, under constant surveillance lol. But it’s not necessarily in a paranoid “big brother is watching you” kinda way. I’m just more aware of my behavior, so there’s an adjustment period. After all I wanted more security. And you can set it to record movement only or sound or whatever you want really.

From my understanding, the cloud service saves 2 weeks of footage then it’s deleted unless you specifically want something saved to the SD card. The night vision on this thing is as good as the day time, though it takes a few seconds for it to realize the lights are off.

Actually I have one minor complaint, but it’s not a dealbreaker per say. It’s the notifications…I finally got them working how I wanted but it took a ton of research to figure out how. Basically I don’t want movement notifications when I’m at home. I want them when I’m not home (e.g. at work). I would set up the schedules without any overlap yet the notifications won’t stop. Apparently, you need to wait until the next day for the notifications to work properly. So say you make a new “rule” for no notifications between 3pm and 10pm, but it’s 4pm right now….you’d have to wait until 3pm the next day for the notifications to stop. The camera doesn’t immediately put that rule into effect even though it knows what time it is, strange (or just lazy coding).

Anyway, that’s my honest review. I’m a happy camper and gave it 5 stars anyway. I’ll update this review if it suddenly stops working or something.",positive
133,Electronics,"WYZE Cam v3 with Color Night Vision, Wired 1080p HD Indoor/Outdoor Video Camera",$35.98 - $70.96,5,"There's a lot to like about these little cameras, so I'll start with the pros first before moving on to a few (mostly negligible) cons.

Pros:
Image quality is very good. 1080p is crystal clear and the ability to zoom, even on event recordings, is a great feature to have. The Starlight feature is also great. I have one camera mounted on an upstairs window facing out and the image quality even in the middle of the night is great. Unless it's very dark, I'd leave the Starlight feature on instead of the standard IR night vision.

Connectivity has been stable and reliable. I check my cameras often when I'm away from home and I've yet to experience any connection issues. I've only had it for a couple of months, so I can't speak on the longevity, but I have dealt with Wyze customer support on some issues I had with their home security hub and the customer service has been very good. Good enough that I plan to keep them as my primary home security system.

You can mount them practically anywhere. They come with several different mounting options, ranging from a standard flat base built into the camera, to 3M mounting strips, an even drywall anchors. The supplied power cord is a reasonable length for most applications, but you'll want to look into a longer USB-to-Micro USB cord if you plan on mounting more than 6-7 feet from a power outlet. They say they're rated for outdoor use, which is a nice touch. I only use mine inside, though I did buy their window mount that allows one of my cameras to face outside and not be subjected to the elements.

They do a decent job detecting people, vehicles, and even animals! Even the cam I have facing the street picks up on moving vehicles, people walking their dogs, etc., from several hundred feet away.

Rules and detection zones, detection sensitivity, and many more options are available, though some require a subscription.

Cons:
Some people might be turned off by the subscription required to view certain events. You *can* install a Micro SD card and get limited event viewing options, though the Cam Plus subscription is also a good deal and gives you a lot of extras like person detection, cloud storage, and the ability to view longer event clips along with other features. The subscription is worth it if you're looking for a home security solution. If you're just looking for a camera to keep an eye on your pets while you're away, then you can probably get by without a subscription. They give you a 2-week trial of the Cam Plus so you can see what it's capable of. If you don't need it, then just install your SD card and go about your day.

The camera does a decent job recording audio but the speaker on it is puny, so talking to someone through it sounds like you're yelling into a tin can from the camera's end. The communication feed may be better on their products like the doorbell cam, but I don't have one of those to test out.

Those minor cons aside, these cameras have worked flawlessly for me since I've had them. I honestly didn't expect so much from such inexpensive cameras. Like I mentioned earlier, I have had to deal with their customer service on another Wyze product (not any of their cameras I own) and they have been great at helping troubleshoot issues and didn't hesitate to send a replacement product when the troubleshooting didn't work. It's great that they stand behind their products.",positive
134,Electronics,"WYZE Cam v3 with Color Night Vision, Wired 1080p HD Indoor/Outdoor Video Camera",$35.98 - $70.96,4,"Ordered one from Amazon, $35. Like that camera can sit inside on window sill, flush to the glass of the window, and perfect video picture, night vision is spectacular (have read some ambient light outside is required). No need to worry about batteries or wiring, it plugs into the wall. You also do not need a subscription for just basic usage, but it will only film an event and notify you once every 5 minutes if you opt for no subscription. For $15/year, it is unlimited with no 5 minute pause between even detections. Has a micro SD slot (micro SD card not included), we just used one we had, but not necessary for camera operation. It can also be paired with other appliances through an IFTT app like a garage door.
The MAJOR ISSUE is that even though you may set your detection area, the detection is via a change in pixels (where Ring, Blink, etc. are infrared and detect a heat source) and we receive an EXCESSIVE DETECTION NOTIFICATIONS when the sun sets and shines through the leaves or at night when car headlights flash across the detection area. We have also read where people receive excessive detection notifications when it rains or bugs attracted to light, but we have not had an opportunity to put it to the test with these. The only solution to minimize these notifications for these non-events is to move the camera or to set up rules to silence events during certain times of the day. For the cost, we decided we can live with this. Our walk around for now, is to just have one family member's phone receive alerts. And the other family members must block the alerts for this specific app in the settings of their phone (not within the app, or it blocks everyone's notifications).
Only the initial person who sets up the camera on the app, can make a lot of the changes to the camera within the app. And other family members are just shared access to the camera and can set up their own rules. The initial person who did the set up will receive notifications a split second before the people it is shared with.
Ordered a 2nd one that was supposed to be new, but WAS OPENED and still had the UPS stickers on it with the customer's name and address who had returned it. So returning the 2nd camera and ordering a replacement, hopefully this one will be new.
Realize with any electronics that receive updates (like with cell phones, fitness trackers, etc), they do not have an infinite life due to technology restrictions so another reason to go for this budget friendly option. I believe Wyze retired support for their 1st model after 5 years.
Price on Wyze website was $29.99 ($57.98 for 2) plus $5.99 shipping, but decided buying it from amazon would make sure we had free returns with Prime. Wyze is a company started by former Amazon employees and it is based in Seattle.
Update: very sensitive to raindrops on the window, birds, neighbors' lights turning on and creates an event and notification.",positive
135,Electronics,"WYZE Cam v3 with Color Night Vision, Wired 1080p HD Indoor/Outdoor Video Camera",$35.98 - $70.96,1,"I installed several v3's 7 months ago. They worked well. However, Wyze was constantly requiring me to install endless updates. It seemed like every week or two. Well, the last update bricked all of my camera's.

Power cycling did nothing. So I took a couple of the camera's down and reset them. All of them went back on line without a problem. However, as soon as I unplugged them to reinstall them, guess what! Dead again. I reset them again--three times same result. Each time they were power cycled they went into the install mode and wouldn't come out of it so they could reconnect.

I called Wyze tech support and they made me repeat all the steps I had already done multiple times. Why? Because the support person doesn't know much about the camera's, they're simply reading from a help desk script, and they have to check off the boxes or they get in trouble.

They tried to convince me it was my fault. The network router wasn't good enough. Too many things were connected to it. On and on. I'm an engineer so I know BS when I hear it. All the cameras worked fine until the update. Then bricked. That's not a coincidence, and they know it. They've had the brick problem happen numerous times, so tech support has heard it all before. Any little info packet problem, minor power spiking (which is normal) or any other type of interference can cause the flash update to go wrong.

Wyze finally agreed to replace all of the cameras, but it took about three hours going in circles with them. I've already spent close to six hours taking cameras down, testing them, talking to tech support twice, and now I've got to reinstall all the cameras again. These are good, inexpensive cameras--when they work. Tech support is available, but watch out because every problem is caused by something on your end. They really love to blame the router.

Bottom line--they just don't want to replace the cameras if they can convince you everything is your fault. This time they did replace them, which I appreciate. They asked me to return the failed cameras, which I don't mind, but it's just more of my time. Their engineers want to look at them. Really! They'll be sitting in a box somewhere with the other few thousand failures. They'll get to mine around 2026 when someone throws them in the trash bin.

When the time I've spent is taken into consideration, these cameras aren't very cost effective. My time isn't free, even though Wyze acts like it is. We'll see how long the new ones last. If their ""technical team"" keeps updating every few weeks like they're doing now, they'll brick some more cameras. It's the risk of e-prom updates. I would skip the updates, but they pop up a nag screen every time I open a camera. It's annoying. Clicking ""don't show again"" is just another waste of time. Customers aren't sitting around waiting for every minor change in the software. One or two updates a year would be adequate. Let me decide if I want the updates. Oh, that won't work because some of the updates are about taking away stuff like the 12 second videos that originally came with the cameras. What a crock!

It takes about an hour and half to set up a half dozen cameras. Each camera has to be updated from 1 to 4 times during the setup process depending on when it was manufactured. That takes a lot of time. Then it will take me another hour to hour and a half to reinstall them. In total, this brick update will cost me 9 to 10 hours of my time at least.

Wyze has better tech support than most security camera companies. It's just slow having to go through the help screen over and over no matter how many times something has already been done. One tech support person was willing to sit on hold while I uninstalled one from the roof. Ok, let me whip out the ladder, climb on the roof and do that for you. I guess they wanted their lunch break.

At least they replaced the cameras, THEY ruined.

I took one of the old bricked cameras that I didn't have to send back, and I re-flashed it with a clean update. That failed also, so whatever happened during the update when the cameras were installed is permanent. That's another design flaw. There's no way to reverse an update and fix a problem.

Tech Support 3 or 4 stars--depending on who happens to answer the phone.
Cam V3 (when it works) 4 stars
Constant Updates 1 star
Camera Software 3 stars
Wasting my time 1 star
Wifi issues 2 stars

I'll use them without EVER updating them again--at least until they force an update, which they do from time to time. I think they have a hardware problem that needs fixing. When lots of people are reporting their cameras have bricked after updates, or after a power recycle, it's not a random glitch. When I was buying the camera's, Wyze didn't mention anywhere that I needed to have them within 10 feet of my router, or whatever they think the maximum distance should be, for them to update properly. The problem with their wifi strength argument is if my cameras are in a location where they have constant, stable wifi connection 24/7 with no problems recording video to the micro SD card, then that should be adequate wifi connectivity for an update. The previous 10 updates completed with no problems. Again, they should be asking a lot of questions about why updates and power cycling are bricking cameras. There's a solution to this problem, if they want to find it.",negative

The easiest set up and many great features if you opt in for the cam plus. The camera works fine with the memory chip and if you want to live stream.. However you need the cam plus if you want to look back at alerts or history and with cam plus you can choose alerts for people, pets and cars. Otherwise it will alert you on any motion if you don’t get the CamPlus.. it’s 18.00 per year.The notifications are better than my ring camera and the twilight vision works amazing.
Almost gave it 5 stars
I had to take off a star because I bought 4 cameras I loved them so much however the free trial would not load up. 2 of the cameras had 3 months cam plus free and that’s where it got complicated it took hours of resetting everything and trying many times..Finally it now shows I have 3 months free before I will get billed. It’s normally 14 days free but if you check Amazon they have them the same price 35.00 with 3 months of cam plus while it’s still available it’s a great deal.

Still love the camera 35.00

137,Electronics,"WYZE Cam v3 with Color Night Vision, Wired 1080p HD Indoor/Outdoor Video Camera",$35.98 - $70.96,4,"We had some of these around at work and I played with them and decided to pick up a couple for myself for home since I was frustrated with my old ones. I have a few thoughts, but overall I'm very happy with them.

1. I bought an Alexa with the screen so I could monitor one of the cameras at my computer, since I found out after purchase that there is no web interface, you have to use your phone. This is my first time having an Alexa as well, and I'm disappointed that the Wyze app for Alex frequently disconnects. I can tell alexa to show me the cam, and sometimes it will stay up for a few days, sometimes it will disconnect for no reason after 10 minutes and I'll have to tell Alexa to pull it up again. It's not a huge deal, it's just annoying if you're looking for a way to monitor a camera for activity for a specific purpose.

2. The camera itself will disconnect from wifi occasionally. It's not frequent enough to be a big deal, but like the Alexa thing, just another minor annoyance that I wish didn't happen. I'd say once a month or so I have to unplug and replug the camera to have it reconnect to wifi.

3. The software is annoying, and has the same issues as my previous camera of another brand. The actual activity monitor unless you have it stationed in a specific area where the lighting is static is basically useless. It doesn't matter how you change the settings, what are you set as active or anything. This thing will freak out at anything, and sometimes it's just it's own rendering of pixels. I've pretty much come to terms with the fact that this just needs to be off.

4. The camera itself, for the price is by far the best I've found on the market. Honestly the picture quality is phenomenal, you have a lot of room to zoom in and around on things, and the quality of the picture with night vision on OR off during the night is second to none.

The overall quality, price and honestly the fact that it's reliable 98.5% of the time is the reason I choose to use these cameras over a lot of other options. Like I said, there's a couple minor annoyances that I really wish could be shaped up, and if they were this would be an absolutely perfect product. That and, you know the motion detection software being actually useful, but honestly I don't need it for that reason really.",positive

Downloading the app and registering each camera was extremely simple. He registered the app, pressed a button on the side of the camera, pointed the camera at the QR code in the app, and viola! Easy as cake.
Mounting the camera under the eaves required 1 screw. We ran power to a plug using a 20-foot USB extension cable (purchased separately). The connections were waterproofed by wrapping them with self-fusing silicone tape.
We selected the V3 cameras because it supports 128Gb SD cards that will continue to record activity even in WiFi goes down. It appears data capacity for a 128Gb card is ~7 days of 24x7 data when set to HD (1080P), ~14 days at SD (720P), and ~28 days at 360p.

A Fire Stick is not bad by any means - but the forward-facing receiver for the signal from the remote is much more conducive. Interestingly, I think the remote for Roku does NOT operate by IR, but rather, by WiFi - same story. The TV being a solid piece, was actually obstructing the signal, so much improved performance.

There are different versions of Roku - most will function similarly, EXCEPT for the remote. I believe that having a remote with volume controls is a valuable (this one does have that!), and while the less expensive Roku devices are tempting, the volume control adds a considerable value. I have another Roku (Ultra from 2019) with a headphone jack - it's useful, but runs out the battery QUICKLY if you use it. This remote strikes a nice balance (no one in my family takes advantage of the microphone function, but I understand it has its uses).

This Roku does not have an SD Card slot for expandable storage - I'll be honest, I don't really use it on the Ultra anyway.

Setup is simple - but can be time consuming. A good 10-20 minutes is advised. And have your E-mail (or a new one) ready, because they'll need registering. It's a peeve of the newer technology, but I don't get many E-mails from them to be honest.

The Roku search system will check for all listed places to get what you're looking for - handy if you have your smartphone just out of reach!

Me too.

That's why I decided to keep the smart OUT of my TV and go with an external solution.

It's been almost a decade since I got my first Roku device. In fact, I got a Roku before Smart TVs were really THE thing. Perhaps that's why I prefer that little box over anything I've seen built into a TV INCLUDING Roku!

The Benefits of an External Roku Device:
- You can upgrade your streaming device any time
- If you don't like how it works, you can unplug it!
- If it's not working properly, you can troubleshoot and possibly update it to fix the problem
- You can use multiple devices if you so choose i.e. Chromecast, Fire Stick, etc.

Roku has been around long enough to perfect their user interface. Let's pro and con it out!

PROS
- Intuitive and easy to use
- Well documented online for troubleshooting
- Has everything. As a streaming staple, there will be a Roku version of most everything you could want
- Integrates easily with TV. This version can be stuck on your TV with the provided double-sided tape
- Voice recognition - no more typing difficult searches with the Roku remote
- Compatible with smart speakers, so Alexa can operate my Roku via voice prompts
- Easy to install
- Has a variety of features in addition to streaming like screen savers, and music
- Phone app available

CONS
- Takes a minute to load when you first power on your TV - about 10 to 15 seconds - nothing terrible

As you can see, I don't have many cons for this device. I'm really pleased with it and I love the dimension it adds to my TV viewing options.

PRO TIP: If you choose to power it with the USB on your TV, buy a USB hub so you can maximize your port and have more options for lights, etc.",positive
152,Electronics,"Roku Express 4K+ 2021 | Streaming Media Player HD/4K/HDR with Smooth Wireless Streaming and Roku Voice Remote with TV Controls, Includes Premium HDMI® Cable",$39.34,4,"Like the headline says: So far, I've only found 1 issue that I can't stand. For some reason, the Roku likes to change the display settings from standard 4K to 4K HDR and it is annoying the crap out of me. Now, don't get me wrong...it's not something that happens every time I touch the TV or anything, but for some reason, it randomly changes it to 4K HDR.

Why is this an issue, you may ask? Well, when it turns the HDR setting on, I'm left with extremely blown-out colors; as if someone over-cranked the contrast, hue, and saturation levels. For example, People no longer have normal flesh tones; instead, they have an orange/red bloom that looks absolutely hideous. Now, you can go into the settings and adjust everything so that it looks correct. However, the next TV show/movie that you watch will likely cause you to go back into the settings and revert everything that you had to change to begin with.

Other than it occasionally pushing the unwanted HDR setting, the Roku works fine for streaming from Netflix, Disney, and Hulu services as well as locally from Emby or Plex.

The only other minor gripe that I would have had is the 'Are you still there' setting that kicks you back to the menu after a few hours of not pushing any of the remote's buttons. It took me a couple of days before I noticed the setting so that I could turn it off.

This, like any Roku, is easy to set up. The transfer of your channels (apps) is easy too. Just follow the screens to ""register"" your new Roku device & give it a name, or location.

I wanted this one, because ""Her son"" is a wifi hog, & this one has a better wifi than the other one. So it stumbles less often. It also has a better HDMI cable, & that's always nice.

I got this one, because the 4K+ stick I have, used RFID, & the backlit remote I want (See review) needs IR. Actually all of the back lit ones us infrared.

Is it (Roku) great? Kinda. You still have to associate a few channels, with either cable itself, or a provider of some kind, so that's a pain. Like History, SYFY, & so on.
I like Roku, & since having the other one (Stick) a few months ago, haven't watch cable TV, but once. There is SO much to watch. Commercials are different, & a friend of mine told me she got spoiled with the small Roku batch of commercials, that ""regular"" cable really sucks. Some channels count down till a commercial break, others just cut when they're ready, no matter the content.

Many of the channels, will e-mail you their line up. Like what's going away, or being added, & the suggestions, WOW. I've never watched so many great programs or older movies, documentaries or shows!
YOU CAN'T hook up a DVR, but more often than not, the show remembers where you left off, even a week or two later. OH, & you can bring your Roku device with you, or log in on your friend's device.

Get one already.",positive

So I wasn’t looking to replace, but thought I’d try Roku to be able to watch IMDb (Freevee), that can’t be ScreenMirrored, on our TV. Was inexpensive, so…
Installing the receiver was simple and straightforward. Just plugged the power in and then the HDMI cable.
Turned on the TV, switched to my HDMI input and was greeted by the Roku setup screen. Language setting, WiFi connect was super simple. Note: the navigation to enter Account info and passwords is much, much better than on the AppleTV.
The setup moves you through a simple setup to connect to the TV and make the remote compatible (volume, off/on).
You are asked to provide Credit Card info, but this is only used if you rent/buy a movie… using Roku is free. Then the Main Menu comes up.
Comes with a couple preloaded Services/Channels like Prime and Netflix. I started with Prime which needed to connect to my account. I did this one old school… entering my email and password (again, easy navigation). Went on to Netflix but decided to use an alternative option. I was given a device code with instructions to go to my computer (I used my iPad) and go to Netflix.com/link. Once there I entered the code and the account was paired. Really, really easy for those provided. But it got even simpler.
When to Search on the Main Menu to look for Freevee. Came up, selected it… boom it was added to my feeds and went through the same verification step. Did the same for The Great Courses which I’ve watched using ScreenMirroring. Easy to load and the Roku navigation for this service is nicer than from the iPad. It also frees up my iPad because it no longer is needed to stream.
As an aside, my wife has had difficulty with the AppleTV user interface so I had to drive the remote. Roku’s user interface is so easy that I’ve lost my job as Streaming Service Navigator. The remote seems to be much more responsive too.
Summary:
Inexpensive
- Easy Initial Setup
- Easy to Add Serviced/Channels
- Easy to Use and Responsive Remote

So impressed that I ordered a second one for the TV in the den.
Came quickly. Easy installation and up and running.",positive

I chose it over the new 4k stick since I still wanted to use my IR universal remote. No complaints so far and have been using it for months. I have it powered from the USB on my TV which causes it to fully power off with the TV. I was concerned at first as this causes it to freshly boot every time and I wasn’t sure if this would damage it overtime but so far so good. And somehow it’s still able to pull down updates on its own so it must be doing it in the background when I’m streaming. The boot time only takes a few seconds so it’s not an annoyance either.

This device is such a welcomed upgrade from my Roku 3. Menu and app browsing is a lot more responsive. My Roku 3 had to be rebooted on occasion or I had to reseat the hdmi cable as the audio would cut out. I have had no issues with this new device. It’s currently connected to a Samsung non-4k 1080p 32” TV.

For the price I don’t think you can beat this. Yes you have to create a Roku account which is kind of lame but this device doesn’t spam you like the Firestick does. The Firestick home screen is cluttered with programming from apps you may not have installed or subscriptions you aren’t paying for. With Roku you’re only displayed the apps you choose to have installed. No clutter, no confusion, no baited clicks to purchasing something on accident. I own a 4k Apple TV as well and I’m bummed I didn’t get this instead. For a lot less money it streams the same way and is just as responsive for me. Plus it allows Airplay which is a huge win.",positive

From what I can tell, I simply received a returned unit. The item was described as having multiple cosmetic defects, however, all I saw was a few small scratches on the Apple logo which doesn't bother me. I was able to buy Apple Care for this iPad after receiving it, which means it was less than 90 days old when it got to me. Essentially I got a brand new iPad for $52 off.

As far as the device its self, especially at $300 for the 64GB model, I think the standard iPad can be a great deal depending on your use case. In my case I wanted something to watch videos on, do school work, and edit videos. The iPad can handle all that for me, and is cheaper than a decent laptop.

There are a couple things I find funny about the base model iPad. It's a 2021 device, but yet it lacks a 5G cellular option. I wouldn't consider this a big deal since I would just tether off my phone if I needed to, but it is worth noting since this is a 2021 device. It also doesn't feature NFC. Lastly, there is no Face ID, but touch ID is fine in all reality.

I only got the 256GB because of the lower price used and I plan to do RAW photo editing on this device, so I would prefer to have more local storage. The 64GB would be fine for someone who uses the device mainly for streaming, and at $300, I think is a great price.",positive

190,Electronics,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,5,"I have used Nook e-readers over the years. A 2010 and 2015 model. The 2010 is dead. The later one is obviously outdated and hasn't been used for a while. My wife used a very early Kindle Fire, also dead. So, I was familiar with Amazon's eBook library and we had many books in our shared library. I decided to update to a Kindle Paperwhite (11th gen) on Prime Day and it has proved a wonderful choice. I've already read about 10 history books in just this last week and I'm looking for more.
.
At 6.8"", the Kindle screen is larger than I've been used to, but that screen makes reading more pleasant and more like a real book. I actually now prefer the landscape mode and have added a Pop Socket to hold the Kindle, since the bezel is pretty narrow. (The PS sticks no problem to the soft rubbery back, after cleaning with alcohol). I have noticed the back really shows greasy finger marks and isn't easy to wipe clean though. The light weight and minimal thickness is really nice for holding for long durations. I specifically don't use a cover, as I did with my Nooks, as that almost doubles the weight and ruins the experience.
.
The touch control could be better, especially when trying to select highlights. The page turns are awesomely quick and the screen illumination is smoothly consistent across the whole screen. The 2015 Nook clearly showed where the LEDs were located! The 300dpi screen is really nice with no pixelation to the letters. I haven't had any ghosting issues either, with the screen page refresh option off. The warmer screen option in dark situations is really nice to read with and I have it set to warm automatically for evening reading. My eyes are much less strained.
.
The non-Signature edition's capacity is fine for me. I don't need to store the whole world's library on my e-reader. I like to read no more than a couple books in parallel, with a handful to refer to, as required. The battery life is absurdly (in a good way) long.
.
In 12 years, the functionality of e-readers really hasn't changed much at all. The improvements have been subtle, but much appreciated. The way books are handled in the library is similar too! The technology development has been much less dynamic on these than say, cell phones. I guess there's not much you can do when the device is basically just for reading. Eagerly awaiting a good color Kindle! (Hint Hint)
I do like the more modern design of the screen layout. It actually is very similar to the old Kindle Fire my wife has and is actually about the same size. Again, nothing really is that new in the e-reader world. The 11th Gen is now quite a bit thinner and lighter though!
.
I do wish Amazon, and others, weren't so restrictive with book formats and DRM's. I can't read my many Nook books on my new Kindle! There are plenty of books in the Amazon store though and I've already rebought some of my favorites, though reluctantly.
.

Loving my new Kindle Paperwhite 11th Gen.! It will keep me entertained and educated for a long, long time. I highly recommend it.",positive
191,Electronics,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,5,"Kindle Signature Paperwhite plus Charging Stand

I own the 11th Gen (newest model 2022) standard Kindle Paperwhite and the Signature Paperwhite. I love them both. If dough is not the issue, I would buy the Signature model for fifty bucks more. Here’s some of my particular findings in use.

Cases: Note that I do not like the Amazon cases because I don’t like folding over cover type cases; I prefer cases that simply help with holding the device. I purchased the “MoKo Case for 6.8"" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear” from Amazon and it fits the Kindle ideally, and most importantly this case DOES go on the proprietary charging stand made by Anker and the charge does go through the case (that is, I do not need to remove the case to charge the Kindle in that charging stand).

Battery: Amazon states that the Kindle 11th gen will hold a charge for 10 weeks, when used at limited brightness for 90 minutes a day (and a lot of other stipulations, like WiFi and Bluetooth off, etc). In reality, many may turn up the brightness, read more than 90 minutes, and Airplane mode on, or use other features that drain the battery faster (See audiobooks below). I have found that my battery drains faster than 10 weeks, but I am using the device with Airplane mode off, Wifi on, Bluetooth On. I do not like turning off wifi in particular because it MUST Be on to sync books between devices, and since I have two Kindle 11th gens, plus a MacBook, iPhone, iPad, and I read 5 books at a time simultaneously, I have no desire to turn wi-fi off. Thus, having Qi charging is helpful…not mandatory but helpful. Another BIG reason for the Qi charging is Audible audiobooks. I do listen to them through the Kindle itself, and the battery drains fairly quickly when listening to audiobooks.

Memory Storage: The Kindle has 8 GB storage, but only 5.8 GB after their software OS. The Signature Kindle has 32 GB storage, but only 28 GB after their software OS (there is slightly different software between the two models as the Signature supports more menu and charging features). So if you love downloaded “off-line” reading, and in particular if you enjoy having audiobooks in your downloaded library (they take much more storage than an e-book), the 32 GB is reassuring.

Auto-light adjust: I can’t even detect that it’s doing anything, but if one rides a train daily to work and it passes through dark tunnels, this feature may be of benefit to you.

Advertising free: Many forget the $20 value of the ad-free that is part of the Kindle Signature. Even those that wouldn’t pony up for it on their own may enjoy it here as “icing on the cake” for the price difference. I like seeing my own book cover on the sleep screen, and that is not possible with the “with ads” version. I thought I enjoyed the ads for editors choice books and book sales and stuff, but I much prefer the ad-free model. And, little discussed fact, the ad-free version has one less swipe to get to your Library or current book every single time you turn on the Kindle. True!

Dedicated Signature Charger Stand: I bought the Qi charging stand and like it greatly. It does work with my “MoKo Case for 6.8"" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear”., and charges through the case and the case fits the stand (but not quite as bump-proof as the Kindle without the case). I like that the stand sits quietly on my desk as I am working, or on my coffee table while I’m watching sports do I can read during commercials. I do not need to keep the AC cord attached to the stand at all times; sometimes I use the charger stand as simply a free-standing stand for either of my Kindles. I like that it can hold my Kindle 11th generation normal edition without Qi charging and I can read on it as an easel stand. I feel the utility as an easel stand is underrated. Qi chargers in general are not free, and neither are easel stands, so coupling those two together, you get the price of this Anker model. I find no issues with the size of the “wall wart” or the plug in the back of the stand. Some people complain with the charging stand that the white light indicator does not turn to another color, such as green, to indicate full charge. A “work around” for this is to place the charging Kindle on the stand upside down; now the LED light at the bottom of the Kindle device itself, which does change color when fully charged, is face upward and easily seen. Frankly, there is no issue with simply assuming the Signature PW is charged after an hour or two. I like this stand much more than I thought I would.

I’ve owned every Kindle since the first one! I use library Libby, and am an Audible and Kindle Unlimited subscribers. I guess you could say I’m a “power user”. I definitely prefer the Signature version, but both are good readers. If I could change one thing about these Kindles, it would be to add a physical button like the Oasis. I realize that sounds outdated, but to reach and switch with the other hand, or reach thumb across screen to scrub, every page turn is a chore that is solved with an under-thumb button like Oasis. Additionally, the e-ink is good, but after two decades, one would think the text versus background contrast would be better…that is, darker text, whiter background. Instead, it remains darkest gray text in lightest gray background, not ideal. Happy reading!",positive
192,Electronics,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,5,"I've had several Kindles for more than a decade now, going all the way back to the Kindle Keyboard. I usually replace them just to get desirable new features, and also because the trade-in/trade-up is always a good deal. I read a lot every single day, up to 50 books a year in the past few years by balancing my attention away from so much toxic social media and taking advantage of Kindle Unlimited. It's easy to get consumed by having a shiny device in your hand with infinite bites of short-attention-span content, taking all your attention away from reading a good book or even enjoying a good show or movie. The Kindle Paperwhite is an aesthetically pleasing and covetable device that you can turn to for the experience of a beautifully printed page with crisp clean fonts and no paywalls popping up or asking you turn off your ad blocker or accept cookies, or sticking annoying ads between paragraphs.

I love that this new Kindle has a bigger flush screen that goes closer to the edges. I can read in the pool with one hand in extremely bright sunlight without any worries or eye strain. At night I can switch it ti dark mode where it's white text on black background and puts off very little light to disturb my wife if I'm up late finishing a chapter. It's got a USB-C port, which I like better because my only problem with older Kindles is when the USB Micro port would start to get loose. Not sure if that would surely would be improved by this, but the fact that USB-C is reversible might make the difference. Plus I think it charges faster and that's one less cable to pack. The new adjustable color temperature setting is a feature I didn't think I'd care about but it's actually nice. If I do some low-light reading with warmth on 3-4, then switch it back, the screen looks all blue and harsh. This think is pleasant to read no matter how dark or bright it is. Finally, it feels like there's still more performance improvements to this one. It feels faster when I turn the page or scroll through my books.

I can tell there's one corner of the screen that's just a bit yellowish even when the settings are for 0 warmth. Lots of people have complained about even screen lighting in all the different Kindle Paperwhites. It's probably the hardest thing to engineer, and this is not an expensive device. What I find is that if the book I'm reading is good, I don't notice it at all.

Amazon should do a subscription plan where you commit to 24 months of Kindle Unlimited and get the Kindle PaperWhite included, and then trade up at the end. They'd still be selling the cases and upcharging for the higher models, but I think that would get more people reading a lot more and maybe draw even more authors to Kindle Unlimited.",positive
193,Electronics,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,5,"The new paper white is terrific. Sometimes when making an expensive purchase that I ""don't really need"" I feel a bit of buyers remorse. But not this time. I loved this thing right out of the box. My friends have had different models over the years and I've always been impressed with the screen, and decided to pull the trigger this year on Prime Day.

This new model is like reading actual print on paper. It is very clear, especially outdoors. I think it is more crisp either outdoors or under a reading lamp. The text is a teenie-tiny bit fuzzy when using the backlight alone (ie. in the dark). It totally works, but as a person who needs reading glasses I notice the difference. I enjoy it most when used outdoors.

I've also found that I read faster. Turning the page is quick and easy. And the Kindle is very light weight, it weighs less than my iPhone!! It is easy to hold for long periods of time.

Book purchasing is quick and easy. You can buy on the Kindle, or from your PC and send-to the Kindle. sorry iOS users, Apple has a stick up their butt so you can't buy from your phone.

My only real complaint is the location of the power switch. It sticks out the bottom of the device and is easy to accidentally press. For example, I was reading on a picnic bench in a park and was resting it and my arms in front of me when suddenly a dialog box appeared ""shutdown, reboot..."" I've also managed to turn it on while in my pocket or carrying it to a different room.. I would have located it on the top or recessed it.

Nitpicky ""could be better"" It could use a lock-screen function so that I can carry it to another room. If you accidentally touch the screen, the pages start turning. Or a different book opens, etc. Currently the only option is turn it off. The power options in settings are either ""sleep"" or ""deep sleep"" . Maybe they could add a progressive ""soft-sleep for 10 minutes and then go into deep sleep"". The default deep-sleep takes several seconds to wake up again. Soft-sleep wakes faster but uses more battery.

Another thing, backing up a page requires a Swipe whereas turning forward is a simple tap. It would be nice if a tap in the left side was backwards (for cases when you fall asleep and the pages start turning :-D )

Battery life so far has been 2 weeks between charges. To get the claimed ""10 weeks"" you need to do a few things: turn off wifi (apparently this is the big battery sucker and gets you 6 weeks) and turn off the backlight. And Read Less. :-) I leave wifi on so that it syncs immediately with my phone. 2 weeks is 2 weeks longer than my iPhone lasts.",positive
194,Electronics,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,4,"OK, I fouled up with my Kindle Paperwhite 11th edition purchase. It was Prime Day and the Kindle was marked WAY DOWN, and I opted for the bundle: Kindle + Charger + fabric cover. Now don't get me wrong, the Charger is nice and the fabric cover is very nice, but for a device Amazon says you only need to charge 5 times a year, getting a premium charger doesn't really make much sense. I already have plenty of chargers, and the Kindle will charge overnight whether I use their super-fast premium charger or something else. And while the case is undeniably nice, you can get one for less than half the money from other sellers on Amazon.

I did not make the mistake of getting the ad-free version. The ad appears on the lock screen and as soon as you swipe the screen, it goes away and stays away for your entire reading session. It's 100% unobtrusive. Other people have given the Kindle one star because they bought the ad-free version, and were angry there are still ""suggestions"" on the Home screen that they consider ads. All I can say is that you get that no matter what, and the solution is to switch to the Library screen rather than the Home screen; that's very easy on the latest software version.

The other huge mistake I made over 4 years ago was subscribing to Kindle Unlimited and somehow not knowing that it was automatically renewing silently every month (for $9.99). I paid enough to buy several Kindles. I guess I thought it was part of Amazon Prime or just something that comes with a Kindle. You can bundle Kindle Unlimited ""Free"" for 3 months with your Kindle purchase, but just watch out when that 3 months are over. I have generally found Kindle Unlimited books second rate (with a few exceptions).

I bought one of the original Kindle Fire versions and the first Kindle Fire HD. They were cool, but I didn't end up using them much. They didn't have good battery life, they were hard to read outdoors, and Kindle software on other portable devices was fine. I think the first one eventually failed, and I gave the HD away to someone who needed to do something that required a Kindle. I have a nice Windows tablet.

But I have always wanted a Paperwhite because of its long battery life and superb readability outdoors. Plus it was heavily discounted on Prime Day and I bought one.

So how did it live up to expectations? Pretty well. The ""10 weeks"" battery life claim seems exaggerated, but still if you pick it up to go somewhere, it will probably be charged and last another day. Outdoor readability is simply amazing.

After receiving the device, the software updated. I think it updated twice. My ""Experimental Web Browser"" turned into the ""Web Browser"" and the navigation improved markedly (addressing issues I read in other 1-star reviews). The web browser is still very limited and doesn't display some web pages correctly (like the Internet Archive), and error messages still mention the ""Experimental"" browser. You can't access YouTube, for example, Twitter doesn't seem to work at all, and the New York Times is not readable.

On books, three-level table of contents don't work on the Kindle, although they work on Kindle for PC.

I had a very good experience emailing a PDF document downloaded from our local Planning Commission to the Kindle. Things you send to the Kindle arrive very fast. Amazon did, however, require me to verify myself as a sender before it would deliver email attachments to the Kindle, even though my email address is on the approved senders list at Amazon. Also plugging the Kindle to a PC lets you drag and drop supported document types (notably MOBI and PDF) to the Kindle where the immediately appear in your Library. The Send to Kindle for PC app is currently broken as reported by me and others on Amazon forums.

The device is somewhat sluggish in general with a 1-second delay for most things: swipes, scrolls and navigation. That's certainly not something that would interfere with reading a book. There are so many different ways to navigate, that it can appear jumbled and confusing, plus the software updates I got changed everything, making me re-learn the UI. I think in the end that I will be accustomed to it and it will appear more natural.

One severe limitation is that you cannot play audio files in general. While it supports Bluetooth headphones for books from Audible, it cannot play music or audio books in general. (I hope this is enhanced in a future software update.)

So should you buy one of these? If you want to sit outdoors under a tree or at the beach for hours on end reading a book, a Kindle Paperwhite makes a lot of sense. The reading experience is good, it's visually sharp and the charge lasts a long time. If you want to listen to music, or do much of anything else you can do on a phone or a tablet computer, you're out of luck.",positive
195,Electronics,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,4,"PROS: Well, I REALLY like the 11th Gen over my 7th Gen. I'll do it in 4 points:
1-Larger Screen.. Nice
2-Color Temp adjustment for the screen. My background is photography so to me the new screen goes from say 8000 degrees Kelvin to about 2500 degrees Kelvin. I'm happy around 4700-5000
3-LONGER battery life.. like 2 months vs 3 weeks
4- USB-C!! YES! (my old microUSB was always getting wobbly.

I did not mention the increase from ""4""GB to ""8""GB..because ..well. in the 7th Gen the 4GB is actually 3.1GB with the rest taken up by the OS on the new one.. it's actually...wait for it.. 6.25GB! Yep the OS went from .9GB to 1.75GB! A bit piggy for me. I made a joke with a few of the Kindle Tech people that they got ideas from Windows Vista!. Most got the joke.

CONS: Now onto issues..several which are really for how I use my Kindle:
1- ok the not quite 8GB issue. Hey I understand the increase in size..but how about making Audible a CHOICE.. you can add it or make it optional. If you take away Bluetooth support and Audible..maybe we might gain some space back. (Personally I use nice plug-in headphones. I really only see Audible BT when on a long drive in the car..like music. But then again, you can just put it in a format like MP3 and play it thru the car. I have the entire Hitchhiker's Guide Radio Broadcasts like that)
2- BIG (to me ) BUG the issue? as in the photograph.. I use Amazon Cloud Collections. I organize my ebooks (most I got before I got the kindles) using Calibre. So when I set up series, I use the Series name, or I use the Author, or Subject as a title for the Collections. sometimes, (as in the case of the Dune series), books are added that happened in-between earlier books that came out. So when that happens I will add the book. And when you have a series of say 11 books, 9 of which came out years ago, I'll add the book as the following:
01-Dune
02-Dune Messiah
03-Children of Dune
then 3 books were added.. Tales of Dune. Paul of Dune, and The Winds of Dune.
In my older 7th Gen PW it showed like this:
00-Tales of Dune
01-Dune
01.5-Paul of Dune
02-Dune Messiah
02.5-the Winds of Dune
03-Children of Dune
BUT, As the photograph shows, the new 11th Gen PaperWhite has a bug!
00-Tales of Dune
01.5-Paul of Dune
01-Dune
02.5-the Winds of Dune
02-Dune Messiah
03-Children of Dune
This should REALLY be addressed!
3-This is not so much a Kindle PW issue, as so much it's an Amazon issue. and it deals with the Amazon Cloud Collections. As I use Calibre, and I have a LOT of books that were originally Epubs, I used Calibre to convert them and organize them into series. And after various different methods, including sideloading from the computer, I decided to use the Cloud Collections. So I sent ALL of my converted epubs (now mobi files) to Amazon and used the website to organize them into the collections. Which went very well ....at first.
First..about 2-3 years ago, Amazon removed the ability to send the Collection to Device. So now I HAVE to use the actual PW to get my Collections onto my Kindle. Recently, Amazon changed the display format on the pages on how they show books and doc files. And if you want to add a book or doc to a collection, it's now incredibly tedious! Formally when you did a box would open that would let you start typing the name of the collection, or make a new collection. All in one box. NOW, a box open which shows 2 or 3 collections.. not in any order other than Recent..with a check box! You can't find the collection by typing the title.. you can only scroll..and it only shows 2 collections at a time. That's fine if you have 6 collections.. but I have 49 page of 5 COLLECTIONS EACH!!! PLEASE PLEASE PUT BACK THE OLD WAY OR ADD A SEARCH OPTION!! You've actually found a way that is so much more tedious than the actual Paperwhite!!!!! you can't even make a new one on there.. you have to go back to the collection Tab.. THEN go back to the doc or book tab and start all over! Please go back to the old way !!!
4- the new Library Series option. It only works for purchased books, not docs. also, I had to call up because it grouped two books together, in a series..(nice), but then stuck on e of the GRAYED OUT, above the first collection.. only in Download. I found out I had to do a Reboot after turning Library option off. (I ended up putting the two books in a collection.. like I like.

Well that's about it. btw I ALWAYS use the LIST vs GRID option.. and using HOME is no longer a nice choice. I prefer when HOME was the same as LIBRARY .. in my case..the first collection, and all the collections after which comes the books in Recent order
now... waiting for a dark brown cork case.
______________________________________
Slight update or comment on the software version. My wife and I both upgraded to the 11th Gen. Her's came with her case..Amazon Black Leather, while I wait for the cork. Her 11th gen came with 5.14.1 1, while mine came with 5.14.0 . I was a bit surprised since both were ordered at the same time. And arrived together. But, not a big issue, since eventually all units will be on the latest software. So? What to do? I've read a LOT on here about complaints it's so hard, I know.
Since my ""update"" was grayed out, I just downloaded the latest version and put it on my 11th gen, and rebooted..and BINGO! No problem, I now have the latest software.

Now fix the real BUG I addressed and fix the ""Manage Your Content"" pages regarding using Cloud Collections. Oh, while you're at it, fix the damn Amazon Android App so I can work with Cloud Collections via the App. And not just my tower. Thanks",positive
196,Electronics,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,4,"I used to be a snob about paper being better than digital. But, my husband has a kindle that he loves and uses all the time. I started to want my own for travel and camping trips. It is really handy to be able to bring a LOT of books with you for a long plane ride or something. I also like that it's water resistant. I brought it to the beach a few times and didn't have to worry about splashes getting on it. I have had books get a little damaged on camping trips (cover bent or torn, pages wrinkled from high humidity) but didn't have to worry about that happening to the kindle. It's very lightweight and comfortable to hold with one hand. It's also a great option if you have a small house with limited storage for hoarding a lot of books.

I like the way you can adjust the display as necessary: font size, brightness, white/amber spectrum for reading at night, etc.

The screen doesn't have glare when reading outdoors and refreshes quickly when tapped to turn the page.

So far the battery life has been amazing! I have had this device since May 2022 and I haven't needed to charge it yet. I keep the Bluetooth and wifi off unless I need to use those functions. That seems to conserve a lot of battery juice. When I first got it, I brought it on a trip, reading for several straight hours on airplanes and then about an hour or two per day for a week long trip, then lots of time reading on planes while traveling back home. Since I have gotten back home, I read for a few hours per week. At the time of writing this review, it is July 7, 2022 and I have now had the device for nearly 2 months. The battery hasn't gotten lower than 70% yet! Your mileage may vary, but I have been very impressed.

My only real issue with this device is that is was a bit hard to figure out the navigation at first. There's no instructions in the box, and no tutorial when the setup has been completed. A lot of the navigation functions are hidden unless you tap on a specific area of the screen. As a millennial who is not as tech savvy as some other people my age, I had a bit of a panic when I couldn't figure out how to use it. I had to watch a YouTube video tutorial to learn where to tap to see the different menus! I can imagine someone like my mom or grandma really struggling to figure it out on their own because they are even less tech savvy than me! But once I knew where to tap, getting around the settings and navigating back to my library is not a problem anymore.

I haven't tried using Kindle Unlimited or ebooks from my local library yet. But, I do check the ""kindle daily deals"" and sites like BookBub for discounts on ebooks. Generally ebooks are cheaper than paperbacks. So unless you are someone really thrifty who only buys used books, you are probably going SAVE money on books, instead of spending more. And, I just realized if you set up Amazon household so your account is linked with your spouse or parent who lives at the same address, you can then share ebooks between your accounts. After you purchase an ebook, from your Amazon account you can ""add to household library"" and then you can both access the same ebook. Which is great if your spouse or parent is also a book lover!",positive
197,Electronics,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,5,"I took advantage of Prime Days to get a Kindle. Now, I’ve had a few days to evaluate it.

I’ve heard critics of the device say that they want the smell and feel of a “real book” and have no use for such a new-fangled device. Such remarks remind me of the late Phyllis Diller. She was notorious for her obsession with plastic surgery. When a reporter wanted to know how she felt about people who say they would never have such surgery because they think nature should take its course, she responded: “Well, let those people grow old gracefully then.” Fear of anything different seems to hold folks back more than a granite wall.

If you think a conventional book is better than a Kindle, you might as well get an icebox, throw out your refrigerator, live without air-conditioning, build yourself an outhouse, and get your liquor from an old fruit jar. Okay, maybe that’s a little strong; I, too, like holding a book. But from now on, they’ll need to be room in my life for both.

Perhaps your hesitation about getting a Kindle is because you don’t really love reading that much or don’t completely understand all a Kindle can do for you. The Kindle is to the book what a book is to drawings on a cave wall. In the next paragraph, I’m going to sell you on getting a Kindle, and I don’t even get a commission. I will, however, accept your thank you.

You probably already know that you can read a Kindle in the dark or outside in bright sunlight, and the screen is no-glare. But did you know that you can press on a word and the dictionary definition will pop up? You can press and hold while you run your finger across a sentence, paragraph, page, or whatever and it will highlight the same way you would use a highlighter for a book. It will stay highlighted unless you delete the highlight. You also have the option to write a note on anything in the text you want: a word, a paragraph, a page, whatever. You can even email your highlights and notes to yourself. When you stop reading, the Kindle will keep your place. The battery life is insanely long, and the device is much easier to hold than a regular book.

If that paragraph didn’t convince you, let me add one more fact: you can get a high-capacity Kindle for a little more money than I spent. However, the one I got – the Paperwhite 6.8 -- gives me a good view and, with 8 GB, will hold an average of 2000 - 3000 books. I said, two to three thousand books. Thank me later.",positive

And reading on the iPad or the Kindle fire, I found I was always interrupted with a text, or an email, or a phone call when it was linked to my phone. I had initially liked the idea of a tablet that had everything in one place, but it does interfere with reading, I find. I am really liking the Kindle, as just a device for reading. It’s also less (or maybe no?) blue light, and I read before bed, so not using a tablet/computer may help or be better for sleep. It is very light weight, and the suggestions/adds on the lock screen don’t bother me. Page turning is easy, but it is sometimes “tricky” to get into and out of other menus. It takes a little getting used to, as the response is different than other touchscreens, in my opinion. It takes a while to find your ideal brightness and warmth settings (I like about 16-18 brightness and no warmth during the day. I set it to shift to warmer in the evening/early morning). Just be aware, if you are used to reading on a tablet, you will lose the color images on the Paperwhite. No big deal, unless you read a lot of cookbooks, graphic novels, or other animated content. Still, if you have the Kindle app on another tablet or computer, it’s easy to switch between the two, if you want. It came 50% charged. I bought the charging plug too. Like many people state, it should really just come with the plug, but most things don’t now, so I don’t really hold that against Amazon in this case. I’ve always been afraid of using “off-brand,” discount plugs/cables; so, I figured why not just buy a new one. I’ve also turned off WiFi to save battery: that’s not just a toggle on/off, either. You just have to use the Airplane Mode to turn WiFi off/on. So far, so good, and I’m glad I made the purchase.",positive
199,Electronics,"Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) – Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light",$139.99,4,"This thing performs so well in daylight and I look forward to reading more books outside regardless of sunlight conditions! So if that's what you're looking for, this is your device.

However, at night I like to read in Dark Mode (or reverse with white lettering on black background) and that is one are that this falls short. I'm sure it has to do with how they designed the screen to be so good in daylight. But when you switch it to Dark Mode, you get a washed out black background (let's call it gray or grey, whichever your preference). So you don't get the sharp contrast that you will find with the other devices (e.g. iPad, Kindle Fire, or Android) that have a black background in reverse screen but suck in daylight viewing. So it looks like I'll use the iPad mini for night reading and use the Paperwhite Kindle for daytime reading. Not my preference, but that's the price to be paid for awesome daylight viewing.

The second area that it falls short is that there are NO options to change the font size, etc. So if you can accept that this displays pages much like a printed book where you get the font size, style and spacing as the publisher printed it, then you'll be fine. I'm just familiar with the Kindle app on other devices where you can personalize the layout for better viewing. I've looked high and low in the few setting selections that it comes with and I found nothing for that. So I've decided to treat it like a printed novel where you have no choices on how it was printed, even though it is an electronic display. Just imagine that it is printed paper and you'll be fine.

The setting selections are very minimal. It would be nice if you could select to have the time display on the bottom margin along with the page number and percentage complete, in my opinion. Some people don't want to have that in view, but I'm often reading while waiting for brief periods of time and would like to keep an eye on the time without having to swipe the screen to view the time - which it is viewable (along with the date) on the quick settings display when you swipe down on the screen.

This device is obviously optimized for daytime reading and it shines in that realm where other devices can't come close. For a simple reading platform with no bells and whistles, it can't be beat - except in Dark Mode. :-)

UPDATED 7/26/22: OK, I accidentally found where you can adjust the font size and select to have the time displayed or not. Oddly you have to do a small swipe from the top to display that portion. Apparently my swipes were always too aggressive and when I swiped a couple of inches, I would get the simple setting screen that didn't have those display options.

After finding that I can get to the settings I was looking for by doing a short swipe, I added a star back onto my rating. Still not able to give it the full five stars because the Dark Mode underperforms to my liking, but that is one small detriment when compared to how well it performs in daylight.",positive
200,Electronics,"All-new Ring Stick Up Cam HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa",$79.99 - $199.97,5,"I have a much better security camera system for my home's exterior but thought I might try one of these cams indoors since I have the Ring alarm system and a Ring Doorbell already. I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't. None. Not a single thing.

It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways. I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed. Nope.

I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn't in the house. Nope. There isn't even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you're home or not. They are not location aware in any way. The Ring alarm system isn't either, so I suppose I should have known better already.

I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording. Nope!

The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours. Note, this doesn't stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts.

Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever.

Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room. I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on. This is a high traffic area so I wasn't holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%. This is with all the 'battery saving options' on. This was only a test as I don't actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I'm home unless the alarm is armed or going off.

With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it's recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording. So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing. I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn't burning down.

Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it's other devices.

This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality. The audio isn't great but it never is on cameras of any kind.

***UPDATE***
Ring support reached out to me directly almost immediately after I posted my review (Good on them) and told me how to link the Alarm, somewhat, to the camera. You have to go into your Base Station settings, then linked devices, then you can set the cameras to record when the alarm goes off - but only then. Make sure you have the updated app that just came out to do this. I didn't. Again, the setting is in your base station, not in the cameras.

This solved probably the biggest issue I had with the camera. The rest of my review is still accurate though per Ring support. Hopefully they'll add the other much needed features in the near future.

***ANOTHER UPDATE***
From Ring Support: ""The Modes feature will be released in November and will allow you to have the option to record motion only if the Ring Alarm System is set to Away Mode"". This will be a great update and should have been available on launch. I wonder if they are only just now thinking of it from all the negative feedback and reviews, but glad it's 'coming soon' either way.

***ONE MORE UPDATE***
Ring provided me early access to the 'Modes Feature' and I've been using it for the past few days. It resolves all the issues I had with the alarm integration. With modes you can set your cameras to only record when your alarm is set. They can all be set independently and act differently depending on if you have your alarm set to off, home, or away. For instance, you can set your exterior cameras to record when your alarm is set to home mode, but have your interior cameras are turned off. You can set your interior cameras to only record while in away mode, etc. etc. Or any combination. The cameras can now be set the same way motion and door sensors can. This is a great improvement. They haven't told me exactly when this feature will be made public but have said it will be released 'by the end of the year'.

I've increased the rating from 3 stars to 5. This software update really has resolved every issue I had with the cameras. I've now ordered and installed an additional 6 for my home.

***LAST UPDATE***
Having the modes features and my cameras set to only pop on and record during an alarm event (which is rare) and be off at all other times, I've had 2 months to evaluate battery life, almost exactly 60 days now. All my cameras were down to below 10% battery level when I checked them last night. Given the rate of battery drain I had expected them to last 3 months - though 2+ still isn't bad. I have two external cameras on my entry gates outside with the solar panel add-on, they stay fully charged at all times even though it's pretty much been non-stop dark and cloudy days here since installation. They are set to record all motion and since they point at a street they record events dozens of times per day... so if you're thinking of getting the solar panels for outdoor use, I highly recommend them.",positive
201,Electronics,"All-new Ring Stick Up Cam HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa",$79.99 - $199.97,5,"Before I start my revised review, let me state that there's been a lot of news lately about people hacking into Ring cameras, but this only happens when someone installs a new camera and doesn't update the default username and password (or has an extremely weak password which is easy for a hacker to guess). This is like leaving your front door open while on vacation. Your camera is sending and receiving signals over a wireless network. Anyone within range of the signal can potentially be a threat if you don't have good encryption (username and good password) set up on your camera. There's no logical reason for a Ring owner to not do this. Ring even stresses changing the default settings during the initial setup process. Bottom line, don't blame the car manufacturer if you leave the keys in your car and it gets stolen.

Recently, I wrote a rather scathing 1 star review about the problems I was having with my new Ring Stick Up Wireless Battery Cam. I'm no stranger to wireless cams, having 10 hooked up and running seamlessly on another network as I write this, but I was totally frustrated with the connection reliability, not only with my two upper end cellphones, but also on my Galaxy Tab and Amazon Show. More times than not, the software wouldn't connect with the camera but when it did, the video was choppy. Notifications were also hit and miss. I have a great wireless mesh router system throughout the house, so after doing all the troubleshooting I could think of, I assumed it was due to faulty hardware or software. I gave up and started the return process through Amazon. It was a new product after all and new products sometimes are really buggy. Plus, I read other negative reviews which seemed to justify my thoughts and actions.
Then I got an email from a gentleman from Ring saying he read my review and asked if I'd be willing to let him help troubleshoot my issues with me. Although I had already started the return process, I was willing. It was refreshing to know Ring Customer Service was genuinely interested in troubleshooting possible defects in their newest product.
Together, we isolated the issue within about 20 minutes. It turned out it wasn't the camera or software after all.
Anyone having connection issues should do what he advised me to do. Open up the Ring app and click on the 3 little dots to the upper right of the camera screenshot, then select settings. From there go to Device Health and check the signal strength. Although I had a good mesh hub (inside) within 10 feet of my camera (mounted outside), my signal strength was RSSI -64. He stated that the signal was so weak it was on the cusp of what is needed for the camera to even minimally operate. This prompted me to reboot my wireless mesh system and reset/reconnect the camera. When it came back online, my signal strength went to -39, a vast improvement.
A quick check of all of my devices showed the camera and software working flawlessly. Hat's off to Ring.
Anyone who may be having connection or audio/video/notification difficulties, check your signal strength to the camera via the Ring software, even if your router is close by. You just might be surprised.
***UPDATE***
Camera (and software) is still working flawlessly on all devices.
Ring has now updated their Windows 10 desktop app (which previously didn't work with the new wireless battery cams) and it works flawlessly as well.
Observations.
Notifications on my phone, Tab and Amazon devices (Show, Echo, Dot) are almost instantaneous. Alexa says ""Someone is at your front door."" Very cool.
I bought an extra battery, but it looks like it'll be at least a few months before I need to swap it out, even with the intensive testing I've done on the Stick Up Cam. Battery life seems excellent.
I have one zone blocked out and that seems to work fine as well. I also have it mounted a couple of feet above and to the left of my front door, tilting downward at an angle. Even though residential traffic is visible in the field of view, I've not gotten one trigger due to street activity. The motion sensor is triggered by anything coming into the bottom half of it's field of view. From the time someone triggers the motion sensor until the time I'm aware of it is 1-2 seconds. That's about as close to real time as you can get. It's not given me a false alarm even once.
Telling my Amazon Show to ""(Alexa), show front door cam"" takes about 5 seconds to complete.
I can also watch triggered video clips and get a live feed while away from home without any extra setup to my network. It's totally automatic.
Because of the customer service I received from Ring and the fact the product is much better than I originally thought, I will be expanding my Ring family soon.",positive

I have still not been able to resolve this issue with the gen3 version of this camera in my particular networking situation. However, Ring customer service did reach out to me after writing my first review. They have been very helpful in offering troubleshooting suggestions, which eventually lead to the offer to return the cameras. This makes sense because 3 out of the 4 I am returning are unopened and the 4th was opened and only used to test connection to the network. I am very grateful that they understood the situation and made an exception in this case.

To be clear, my network situation is unique in circumstances as most people will not be using Verizon hotspot data as their internet provider when using their Ring cameras. Though I have heard of similar situations not working for other types of connections, some of those could also be a users home network settings and can be fixed. Bottom line is that Ring will make sure you are taken care of if it truly is a non working situation. The representative was clear and did not just run off of a script. He understood when I explained what I had already tried and did not ask me to repeat any trouble shooting steps that I had already been through before.

I have about 20 other ring cameras that are working rock solid, so this is all good news it is getting resolved. I still need a solution to cover these areas, so I will be trying Rings Spotlight Cam Battery's which I have had success with before. I am not sure if they have been revised from their earlier models, so I will update this review if I have better luck with those.

Hopefully whatever is going on with those gen3 can be targeted and fixed by a firmware patch or something, as I think the Stick Up cams are great value for the type of application I need them for.

(Original Review May 6, 2021)
The gen 3 Stick Up Cam Battery seems to have gone through some changes since the gen 2 that seem to create issues. I am an experience networking tech with around a dozen of the older stick up gen 2 cameras. I have had no issues with any of these cameras, so naturally when it was time to purchase more I thought it would be fine to use their gen 3 models instead. I think I have 6 gen 3 models now, and at least 3 of the 6 exhibit this same issue. I can say the new mounting has its pros and cons, but the real problem is compatibility with networks / ISP. You may be rolling the dice on whether or not it will work at all, as there are several reports of the same issues I am having. All of my gen 2 cameras are and have been running rock solid for months if not over a year at a time. Using the same networks, even right up close to the router, these gen 3 cameras will not send video. Whether it is a live view, or trying to review past motion events the recording is always a black screen. Everything in the settings says that things are connected and working correctly and have great RSSI. Motion notifications and events seem to trigger just fine and the thumbnail is updated in the video menu, but nothing but a blank screen when it comes to any actual video footage. I have tried this on 3 different networks all with the same results. Each of which currently have active and working gen 2 stick up cams with no issues.

However and strangely enough, the only way I can get the gen 3 model to show live video is by connecting it to a t-mobile hotspot of all things. Everything seems to work perfect and speedy when it is connected the t-mobile hotspot which shows that the camera itself is technically functioning. When I use a verizon hotspot to connect I get the same blank screen for video. So basically these gen 3 models are all unusable for my network because of this mystery bug.

I have read dozen of reports of this same thing happening on the community forums for ring. It seems calling tech support just gives the customers the runaround because they want to blame it for networking problems. But why do the gen 2 models work just fine on the same networks? Something is wrong with these gen 3's that everyone should be aware about. I do not have the time to waste calling ring tech support just to have them guide me through their scroll down menu techniques of how to troubleshoot these things just to blame it on the network or user error when I have already done those things and 10x more.

If i wasn't passed the 30 days return period having to try and figure out this issue I would gladly return them all. But I still need cameras for these areas so I would prefer that the problem was fixed, or they were replaced with something that works. If you experiencing these blank video screens as well, make sure you make it known.",positive
203,Electronics,"All-new Ring Stick Up Cam HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa",$79.99 - $199.97,4,"I love Ring products, but the Stick Up Cam ""battery"" isn't my favorite for a few reasons:

1) Being battery-powered, response time is notably slower than with Ring's wired products.
2) It doesn't record the moments immediately before it detects motion as many of Ring's wired products do, so people are often leaving the frame of view just as the video starts to record.
3) Wireless connectivity is good, but not great, and often yields delays in connecting to live view or intermittent drop-outs from the network. I don't have the same issue with my other Ring devices, some mounted further away from the wifi source. Again, I believe this is related to the lower power consumption required to accommodate a battery as the main power source.

On the other hand, the overall design is great, video detail is very good, and night vision works well. Plus, good deals can be found on these and the use of a battery, while requiring monitoring for charge and replacement every few years, really gives this version flexibility in mounting that few other products on the market can match.

All in all, I'm fairly happy with the ""battery"" version of this camera, but it just isn't quite as powerful and fully featured as some of the other Ring products.",positive

The picture quality is much better than my POE system which is supposed to be 1080p (HD). The only issue I have is when it detects motion, the first 1 to 3 seconds of the video is staggered/stuttering. This would not normally be a problem but I've noticed when I enter my pool area and later view the video, the first few frames stutter then I am out of view but now have perfect video of nothing happening.

This ring step stick up camera has frustrated me beyond anything I could ever begin to tell you. After going around with the ring every single day this past week I finally found a technician who somewhat started to make sense. He felt it was my internet speed so initially he said it was the upload speed And then after that didn't work he then said it was the download speed. But I do believe we were in I contacted my internet provider and I had them increase my download and my upload speed That did not work Then today I had them send a technician out to look over what was going on with my wireless box my wired box my router and outside aspects.the right He spent 2 hours here He rewired he changed out boxes He replaced my modem to the most current modem they have and I am pleasantly surprised to say that everything has been working for the last 10 hours. That is the longest that camera has worked. So quite obviously it was my internet. I just wished ring instead of keep sending me out cameras had initially said you know your Wi-Fi it could be your Wi-Fi and that isn't what occurred up until the last couple of conversations. So if you're having issues with that stick up camera it could be your Wi-Fi. My ring doorbell has been perfect from day one never an issue That was wired this stick up camera is solar I don't know if that has anything to do with it but truly the issue was my Wi-Fi so I wanted to be able to update everybody. Cuz my last couple have not been very nice or very good. So I love the ring stick up camera premise it is now working great and I upgraded my star review to four stars. If anything changes I will come back and update.area of the issue.
February 9th 2020 update.
This is the most unstable camera I have ever used. every day since this has been installed I have called ring because the camera goes offline or it takes an hour and a half to reset itself. last time I called I was on the phone with them for an hour and a half and they said that the device was defective. They sent me out a new one that was installed yesterday. At 4 p.m. by 6:25 p.m. the camera was not working again. I called ring this morning and it went from defective camera to it's my internet. If that were the case and it's my internet the ring security system wouldn't be working the ring chime wouldn't be working the ring doorbell 2 wouldn't be working my cell phone wouldn't be working my TV wouldn't be working etc etc etc. I'm ready to fling this flipping thing cuz I'm just playing tired. I called this morning and had to escalate my call to a manager while they're very nice at ring and I've said that from the get-go when somebody calls you every day for two weeks with the same issue and then today you're being told after all this time that it's not their camera and now it's my internet and it could be a firewall and it could be this then wouldn't it firewall for every single ring product that I have which is multiple? So I finally got the manager to agree to send somebody out here to figure this out. I am legally blind this morning's phone call was they wanted me to climb a ladder and reset the camera which is about 10 feet up. No can do. On top of that I've paid somebody three times to come out here to install their products to replace the cameras to install the cameras I can't keep doing this.They have agreed to send me a coupon code and communicate with Amazon home and they will send somebody outwell I'm very appreciative that they are doing this I am so frustrated with this camera. At this point I would not recommend that camera for all the money in the world now the other ring products that I have I think they're awesome. So I will update as time goes on if this can't be resolved then I'm going to send that camera back because it's worthless to me. so I dropped my review from a 5 to a 2 at this point and we'll see what happens
I had a ring stick cam solar and a ring doorbell two wired installed last Saturday. The video is awesome the motion detection is excellent not going to lie and say I don't get some false rings but that's okay it's not a lot. What I really like is the ability with both the stick cam and the doorbell to speak to somebody who's at my door. Excellent sound excellent quality of each item. I would highly recommend and as a result of this installation I am going to do the security system for the inside of my house. I have a wired camera system for my exterior I feel ring is just as awesome as those cameras. If anything changes I will update this review.",positive
208,Electronics,"All-new Ring Stick Up Cam HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa",$79.99 - $199.97,4," Update 30OCT (original review and first update follow this): I changed my recommendation opinion and recommend the camera now. It doesn’t have the best FOV so the motion detection isn’t the best, but if you utilize the camera to the best of it’s abilities (i.e. don’t try to use the camera mounted high to cover large swaths or property but rather keep it at ~7ft to cover your back porch or something) it does a decent job. It’s a cheaper camera compared to Arlo or some of the other Ring models so you should manage your expectations of it’s performance.

The WiFi signal strength has been sufficient. I initially thought I may have a problem but they seem to be working fine. That’s not to say that a Chime Pro wouldn’t help since I’m on the lower end for signal strength.

What I absolutely love about this camera is the customer support that comes with it. After my initial poor review, Ring customer support reached out to me in an effort to help and to pass feedback on to the design team. The representative that called me was professional, competent, and effective. My specific camera may have an issue, but they are ready to swap it out if none of the solutions work. Components can fail at any point, but as long as the customer support still backs it up, I still consider it a good product.

The solution the tech representative suggested was to perform a factory reset by holding down the setup button for 30 seconds with the battery in. Then, set up the camera as you did before. There's no need to remove the old camera from the app since it will get over-written after the factory reset. He mentioned that he's observed the freezing problem with this model, but so far the factory reset has solved it. It's a simple process that takes a few minutes so if you are having similar problems, I suggest you do this.

The tech rep even followed up to see how the cameras were doing after the factory reset, so like I already stated, the customer support is top notch.

Bottom line is that it’s a cheaper camera so don’t expect it to perform like the spot or floodlight models. However, it still performs sufficiently in proper use cases and has good video quality. The customer support is top notch and is what ultimately made me change my mind to recommend this camera.

Update 28OCT: I’ve upgraded the review to three since the motion detection has improved from the first few days and the fogginess was from an especially wet day. However, one of the cameras stopped working and now fails to detect anything, turn on with linked devices, or give any notifications. I’ve removed the camera and tried to reinstall it several times but it ends up in an endless “updating its software” loop. I’ve waited about 20-30 minutes for it to finish but it doesn’t. I can’t access the camera or any of its features until this “update” process finishes, which it won’t, unfortunately. It seems like I have a bad camera. Their support has reached out to me, which I appreciate, and I’m curious to what they are going to say.

I initially thought the motion detection was horrible but I consider it average now. It has a much narrower FOV than a lot of the other Ring or Arlo cameras. However, it’s a much cheaper camera than these alternatives but you get what you pay for. I’m not sure if it’s worth the money, though. I have a pair of other cameras I just purchased that I’m going to try out and return these if they perform well.

Original Review:
I can not recommend this product, primarily because the motion sensing is bad. I’ve been testing two of these cameras the past 2 days in both day and night conditions and they work maybe 10% of the time. If you watch the video I’m including, I walk directly up to the camera, wave my hands, and absolutely nothing happens. I have daylight videos showing the same thing but I can only post one video per review.

Another problem I noticed is that the cameras have bad WiFi antennas. I placed the cameras in the same location of the Arlo cameras I’m trying to replace and the Ring cameras are having a connection problems where the Arlo ones were perfectly fine. Yes, I could add a Chime Pro, but that’s another $50 expense that could be better spent on a more expensive Arlo camera.

The cameras fogged over completely in the morning, but I live in Washington, which is incredibly wet. The Arlo cameras fared much better but they still had some fog issues.

I did like the integration it has with my other Ring products such as the doorbell and alarm system. The video was good as well. However, with the severe motion detection and WiFi problems, I can not recommend this product. I’m going to give it another few days and probably switch back to Arlo.",positive

230,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,4,"Due to my answer in the QA section receiving many endorsement, i decided to give it a bit more detailed review after 2 weeks into owning the Blink setup. I came from Simplisafe, and i still do have simplisafe's alarm system, but due to their lack of outdoor camera solution, i finally decided to pull the trigger on the latest Outdoor blink and try out the Mini blink as well.

First thing's first, the new Outdoor Blink cam works mostly as advertised but the indoor Blink Mini is junk. Read more about the Mini below. But first the Outdoor (good)

Blink Outdoor:
Motion recording speed & Delay:
The Outdoor cam's trigger time is almost instant, in fact, I noticed that it even records a second before entering the frame. which tells me that it might be doing some kind of constant recording into the cam's onboard volatile memory as cache, and once motion is triggered it starts encoding the data and dumps it onto the cloud. So the trigger time is almost instant. However, note that there is a 5 second delay from what's happening Live vs what you see on your phone. so that delay is between Trigger --> Encode --> Cloud --> Decode. I""d imagine that if your Cam is connected to a wifi bridge as oppose to directly to the main router, the delay could be longer than 5 seconds. Compare to Simplisafe cam, the Live vs View delay is about the same. and the trigger time is about the same too.

Motion sensor & sensor distance.
the motion sensor distance in the Outdoor cam is less than 25 ft. despite what the feature ad would tell you. i have 4 Cams (3 outdoor setup at an angle pointing down 45 degree angle, and 1 in the garage looking pretty much straight flat at my car), 3 of the outdoor ones could pretty much trigger 15~20ft out, while the one in the garage struggles to even trigger at 15 ft. You should also take night vision into account. in NV mode, the distance is 5ft shorter. increasing the IR blast in NV will somewhat mitigate the problem but at a cost of battery drain. i tried moving the cam in garage from pointing 45 degree down to looking almost straight horizontal to improve motion sensing to a degree. So if you have trouble with the motion sensor, try that. Compare to Simplisafe's cam, the Simplicam seems to have farther motion sensing distance. But then again, Simplisafe still doesn't have an outdoor solution.

Speaker/Mic
the speaker and Mic quality is really good. it doesn't sound overly tiny like you would expect and is loud and clear. compare to Simplicam, the Blink Outdoor has better sound and mic.

Wifi Wireless
i was surprised how well the wireless works. lots of complains in the review about wireless distance, not sure if they're genuine. but my farthest cam is about 80ft away from my main router thought a living room, a dining room and a garage and garage door (just shy of the max 100ft advertised in the spec), i am still able to get above 33% wifi N signal. But i think a lot of this ""might"" depend on the quality of your Wifi router. i spared no expense on my home wifi. So my router is 3x3 beam forming top of the line AC router that also has a very wide 802.11 N coverage. it can reach far and carry lots of bandwidth. my advice is invest in a quality wifi router with the most bandwidth and range you can afford. Note that the cams and module only supports 802.11 N. Compare to Simplicam, the wifi signal reach is about the same, if not slightly better than the Simplicam.

AC Wireless.
part of the charm and strength about the Blink Outdoor is its battery powered wireless nature. Only time will tell how long my Cams will last. I will update this review and reflect the score once my first set of battery run out. My gut tells me it'll be less than 2 years, well less. but i'd be happy if i can get even 1 year out of those cams. Note that the advertised 2 year battery life from Amazon is based on roughly 2 mins of video footage per day per cam. One of my busiest cam facing out the front door is seeing 2~3 times that amount.

Resolution/video quality
the resolution of the cam and video compression is really good. compare to those legacy 480p outdoor cams, this was a big step up. but compare to the simplicam, i would say the image looks slightly sharper than the Simplicam. but note that true 1080p resolution is only possible with high quality video record setting, which can chew up your battery and storage. Amazon's 2 year battery life is based on medium setting, which is actually 720p. but even at the medium setting, i still find the image to be very sharp and clear. going from medium to high (1080p) setting yield ""some"" improvement viewing on a smart phone. you likely won't be able to find big difference viewing it on a smartphone unless you view both videos on a large monitor. oh which btw, currently there's no app available for desktop computers. you'll have to either download the footage or pull the backup off your thumb drive to view it on a dekstop.

Storage
ok, this is the most contentious and messed up part. the ad made you believe that you don't need to subscribe to cloud and able to store locally. what they don't explain to you is that local storage is only a secondary option on top of the cloud subscription. so you CANNOT, at least at the point of this review, store your recordings directly to the USB thumb drive and read off of it directly. how the Blink cam works right now is everything gets dumped to their cloud server, and when you view the footage, it reads off their cloud server. the USB thumb drive is just there to backup ""from their cloud server"" ""once a day"". there is no way for you to have the cams upload recordings directly to the thumb drive locally and view them from your phone wirelessly off the USB Thumbdrive. There're a lot of people asking about this question on forums and, like me, only found this out after the fact. It's not a deal breaker, but it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Why not just come out and say it. It's simply misleading. if you go to their website, and dig, and i mean really dig, you'll find that there is a way to run it without subscription. but any motion trigger or live views will not be recorded. So what's the point of local storage? it's almost like they just want to find a way to cramp that ""local storage"" wording into their ad to sell you the product only to find out that it's a secondary backup on top of a pay subscription.

Now onto Blink mini (junk)

Blink mini on the other hand. To put it simply is junk or an opportunity wasted. the Blink Mini has a long standing bug that plagued the camera for at least 2 years, and the dev team still hasn't released a fix. The issue with Blink Mini is that it fails to trigger motion recording coming out of night vision mode when you enter the room to turn the lights on. the dev team explained that something to do with the cam goes into freeze mode when it attempts to wake itself out of night vision to do recording. for that reason, it's pretty much trash if you intend on using the Mini as any kind of indoor security cam. I originally intended to use the Mini in my garage to monitor my prized stallion. But i literately would go into my garage and walk up to the car and no motion or recording is triggered. Dev has acknowledged this issue since late 2018 and said in 2019 forum post that firmware update is coming to fix this. it is now end of 2020, i would not count on it. The only reason i kept my Mini and ordered another Outdoor cam for the garage is so that in any case when we go on vacation, i can set the Mini up in the living room to do live view. But if you're thinking about getting the Mini for motion triggered security cam indoor, forget it. don't say i didn't warn you.

Software UI/UX
the interface for the app is easy to use and more organized than many other similar services. clips are organized with usable filters at your disposal. the motion sensing manual dead zone configuration is helpful, although likely not too useful if you're using it outdoor, since the ""motion sensor"" distance (not wifi distance) is well shy of advertised 25ft.

OVERALL
the new Outdoor blink has a lot going for it. If they can fix their advertisement wording, or better, let us have the option to record directly to the USB Thumb drive and be able to view the recording from our devices directly from the thumbdrive. it'll then be a True local storage solution. the only reason i ditched my Simplicam is because i really wanted to have smart Cams covering my house outdoor. Been 3+ years since Simplisafe said that they would come out with an outdoor solution. But till this day, still nothing. i just got tired of waiting. When i saw the new Blink Outdoor being advertised for Black Friday, i really wanted to give it a try. i would say the barrier to entry is minimal. the Blink hardware given the discount that amazon has been giving out, is worth the shot. Without the deep discounts, i am not so sure. They just need to improve the motion sensor distance coverage, and let us really use the USB thumb drive for storage. In a sea of smart home security market today. Amazon really needs to do more to win over customers and not only that, to keep them there. If they can combine Ring with Blink, i might just ditch my Simplisafe completely and go Ring to combine their alarm system with Blink. If they can do that, i don't mind paying the $10/month subscription. But at its current state, they still have work to do to win over customers.

i will update the review on the battery life",positive
231,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,3,"Empecemos por decir que lo que ofrece el producto es lo que vas a obtener ni mas ni menos.

El producto es totalmente inalámbrico , lo que le da ventajas a la hora de una instalación limpia rápida y sin cables a simple vista.

La conexión vía remota desde el celular a través de app es genial y muy fluida, cuando quieres ver los videos, aunque la conexión con mi dispositivo echo show 5 a sido casi imposible para el control de voz y para la visión en vivo tiene un delay bastante desagradable.

La duración de las baterías es excelente tengo 5 camaras instaladas y una de ellas esta en la entrada del conjunto residencial, lo que hace que diariamente este por las 70 notificaciones de movimiento promedio con sus respectivos videos y aun después de un mes dice que esta sobre el 70% de vida.

Las notificaciones son casi que en tiempo real max unos 10 a 15 seg después de la detección de movimiento llega la notificación a la app de celular, pero la conexión con alexa en mi caso a sido terrible y bastante deprimente porque me decidí por el producto justo por esa función y no he podido darle solución a los errores constantes entre alexa y el skill de blink.

Ahora indaguemos mas en lo tecnico y por lo cual me ha decepcionado un poco el sistema.

Este no es un sistema de vigilancia de video es mas en mi opinión un sistema de alarma de movimiento con capacidad de grabar el evento que activo la señal de alarma, aunque muchas veces ese video termina por frustrarte mas y a continuación explico el porque

El sistema solo puede grabar entre 5 seg y 60 seg de grabación y aunque a veces 60seg es mucho tiempo, tiene una opción que permite parar el video antes si el movimiento se detiene, pero aca es donde comienza el problema en realidad, si activas esta opción, el sistema tiene una contra que la camara al desactivarse tarda 10 seg en volver a estar lista para registrar otra alerta lo cual hace que a veces pierdas información valiosa en cuanto a seguridad, si el movimiento para y luego se reactiva mientras la camara esta en el reposo de los 10seg, la camara no registrara nada en video y si el intruso sale fuera del rango de detección ya no podrás saber que paso luego, incluso si el movimiento llegar a seguir después de los 60seg max de grabación por alerta, la camara entraría en ese mismo tiempo de descanso de 10seg.

Aunque las alertas en la app son muy rápidas este Tiempo se puede ver afectado si la opción de alertas rápidas no esta activada, ya que esta viene desactivada por defecto y si no se activa en cada camara puedes tener unas que te avisen y otras que las notificaciones llegue siempre tarde o después que ya se detecto el movimiento.

En resumen si lo que quieres es un sistema de alerta de movimiento o cercanía este es el sistema que debería comprar pero si quieres un sistema de vigilancia de video busca otras opciones.

Dentro de amazon hay varias opciones de camara ptz wifi con grabación continua, detección de movimiento, alarma sonora y audio doble vía que trabaja muy similar a este sistema y con una memoria de 32gb tienes hasta 4 dias de grabación continua y son mas económicos, aunque no son tan excelentes como este en visión de video en vivo o revisando archivos de alarma te serán mas útiles si lo que buscas es un sistema cctv, por lo menos en mi opinión.

Postdata aun no se como funciona el sistema sin la membresía a Blink plus aun estoy dentro de la prueba gratis y aunque ya tengo todo el sistema para grabación local pronto volveré con mi opinión de como se porta el sistema una ves no tengas el soporte de Blink Plus.

--------------------------------------------------------

Let's start by saying that what the product offers is what you are going to get, no more, no less.

The product is completely wireless, giving you the advantage of a quick clean installation without wires at a glance.

The remote connection from the cell phone through the app is great and very fluid, when you want to watch the videos, although the connection with my echo show 5 device has been almost impossible for voice control and for live viewing it has a delay quite unpleasant.

The duration of the batteries is excellent, I have 5 cameras installed and one of them is at the entrance of the residential complex, which means that every day there are 70 average movement notifications with their respective videos and even after a month it says that it is over 70% life batteries.

Notifications are almost in real time, max about 10 to 15 seconds after motion detection, the notification arrives on the mobile app, but the connection with alexa in my case has been terrible and quite depressing because I decided on the right product for that function and I have not been able to solve the constant errors between alexa and the blink skill.

Now let's dig deeper into the technical and for which the system has disappointed me a bit.

This is not a video surveillance system, it is more in my opinion a motion alarm system with the ability to record the event that activated the alarm signal, although many times that video ends up frustrating you more and I will explain why below.

The system can only record between 5sec and 60sec of recording and although sometimes 60sec is a long time, it has an option that allows you to stop the video earlier if the movement stops, but this is where the problem really starts, if you activate this option, the system has a counter that when the camera is deactivated, it takes 10 seconds to be ready again to record another alert, which sometimes means that you lose valuable information regarding security, if the movement stops and then reactivates while the camera is At rest for 10 seconds, the camera will not record anything on video and if the intruder goes out of the detection range, you will no longer be able to know what happened next, even if the movement continues after the maximum 60 seconds of recording by alert, the camera would enter that same rest time of 10sec.

Although the alerts in the app are very fast, this Time can be affected if the quick alerts option is not activated, since it is deactivated by default and if it is not activated in each camera you can have some that notify you and others that Notifications always arrive late or after motion has already been detected.

No me In short, if what you want is a movement or proximity alert system, this is the system you should buy, but if you want a video surveillance system, look for other options.

Within amazon there are several wifi ptz camera options with continuous recording, motion detection, sound alarm and two-way audio and lights that works very similar to this system and with a 32gb memory you have up to 4 days of continuous recording and they are cheaper, although They are not as excellent as this one in viewing live video or reviewing alarm files. They will be more useful if you are looking for a cctv system, at least in my opinion. Postscript I still don't know how the system works without Blink plus membership I'm still in the free trial and although I already have the entire system for local recording I'll soon come back with my opinion on how the system behaves once you don't have Blink support Plus.",fair
232,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,1,"REVIEW UPDATE

We recently lost our internet connection due to updates our ISP had to make. What we didn't know is that Blink cameras are solely dependent on an Internet connection (not just a wifi connection) even if you don't have a subscription or just have the trial. None of the outdoor cameras will remain active when you lose Internet connectivity. My wrongful assumption was that ONLY your local area network was needed since it relies on a wifi signal. Nope. That is wrong. The Sync Modules will flash the green LED and no camera will work. Great job Blink/Amazon for putting customers at risk to thieves and other criminals.

We have 4 of the outdoor cameras on two separate Sync2 Modules due to the distance from the main router. We have an extender (set as a repeater) which handles the furthest cameras. As I said I never considered these would go offline if the Internet connection went down. I figured if my LAN went down then it would make total sense the cameras would go offline, yet I was foolish in my thinking.

Again this is shameful of Blink/Amazon to have this even as a feature. I get that you need an account to pay for the service, but why in the world would these be designed to FAIL if your Internet connection goes down?

It is not only misleading to consumers to not EXPLICITLY state that these cameras will fail to operate without an Internet connection.

This IS one of the WORST investments my family ever made in a product. Would have been better to purchase a CCTV camera system and just hardwired everything on the network. For what we've now paid for 4 cameras + the sales tax we could have gotten a 4 camera CCTV setup instead from a local box store.

As I have said in my original review, the cameras do work, and will suffice. Keep in mind that an Internet connection is REQUIRED and not just your local area network connection. I had to lower my rating to just one star because nothing is lower than that on Amazon's site. I'd give this camera system negative stars it it were possible just based on our experience over the past few months.

Also I think I was far too generous with parts of my original review, but experience will change your mind when the experience becomes bad.

I no will longer recommend ANY of the Blink cameras. Until they are no longer dependent on an Internet connection and will fully function on just your local networks wifi signal. I will be researching a true CCTV camera system to replace the Blink cameras. If I could get a refund I'd do it in a heartbeat, but that window has closed. The price of this education is high!

---------
Original review

Recently purchased the Blink Outdoor 2 Camera system, and it's a very hit or miss system. I have several things to say about the security cameras and the Blink app that goes with it.

The base:

The friction fit mounting bases are not easy to snap into place. I had to use a long and think flat headed screw driver to aid in connecting it. Also I worried about crushing the sensor on the camera because of how much force it takes and where my hands are pressing on the camera itself (holding from the edges while mounting under a roof eave is moderately annoying). Once it is finally snapped to the base it moves freely and the camera stays in place.

The Sync 2 Module

This is the brains of the system. Each module controls up to 10 cameras and utilizes your 2.4GHz Wifi connection. Now I mistakenly assumed that my 2 camera system didn't include the Sync 2 Module (I didn't notices a ""what's in the box"" on Blinks Amazon page. So I ended up buying one which was a waste of money considering it's included. The setup takes a while after you power it on you'll need the app to discover the device. Initially the blue LED flashes and the green LED is steady. Once it is discovered then then both LEDs are steady.

The app (Android)

At first the app to control this camera system seems simple, but there are some annoyances I've discovered. The system will NOT discover the best WiFi connection on your network. I have an detached garage with the camera approximately 75 feet from the Sync 2 Module, and my router is close to 10 feet from the Sync 2 Module. So I picked up a WiFi extender and set it as a Repeater (firewall, DNS, DHCP etc. is controlled by my primary router) in order for the signal strength to be at a maximum. It is recommended that you use the existing WiFi names (SSIDs) on your network (for 2.4GHz only) and append _EXT so Blink can see it if using a Wifi extender. Also keep your password keys for your wifi extender the exact same that are on your main wifi router. Now in theory (and based on Blink's own guidelines) the system should pick the best Wifi signal based on your setup. Well it doesn't, and there is NO option in the Blink app for me to place my garage camera on the extender Wifi (again it's on the same network as all my devices are) while keeping the door camera on the primary router (same network once again). This is not about changing networks, this is about discovering the extender on my main network (which I repeat Blink claims it will chose the best signal automatically). Yes I could add the second Sync 2 Module in the garage, but then I'd have to create a second system for the garage camera. Not entirely what you should have to do.

Batteries: These cameras require the more expensive Lithium AAs you do get the batteries with the cameras (mine were Energizer Lithium AAs. The cameras are equipped with a USB B mini connection which you can use to connect to a powered USB source as to not run off batteries. In my case I picked up a motion detector LED flood light that offers a USB connection (this unit https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08F9CNPVW). I would remove the batteries from the cameras because I do not know if connected will it try to charge the batteries (these are NON chargeable lithium batteries) or it will it bypass the batteries? I would err on the side of caution and remove them.

Local Storage (USB thumb drive) vs Blink Subscriptions

This is an Amazon product and you'd think that the Blink camera systems would provide free service to Amazon Prime members. Nope. You are nickled and dimed on a per camera basis at $6 monthly, and it's $100 annually (if I read it right) for one full system). Again why is this NOT part of Prime Membership?

So to avoid saving to the cloud I bought a 256GB thumb drive to insert into the Sync 2 Module. What I have discovered is ONLY clips are saved locally. You are NOT able to save live recordings to the local storage. Really? Why? What's the point of only having the clips (maxed at 60 seconds) on a local drive? To me this is a rip off and not mentioned anywhere in the product details.

Yes you do get a ""free"" trial which unlocks all features. If you; however, cancel that trial early or let it expire without buying a subscription than certain features are locked. So again you pay a lot for the camera system and you are locked out of many features IF you don't buy their subscription to the cloud. Talk about ripping folks off. Sure you can look at live feeds, but you can't same them locally. You can take a snapshot from the cameras, but it will NOT take a photo every hour UNLESS you BUY a Blink subscription. Again this all goes back to Blink subscriptions. Tell me what's the point of local storage if all you can save are clips?

Loading issues with clips and thumbnails. So I've run into issues where loading a clip from the connected USB drive fails to load 95% of the time. Again these are short clips and should pull faster than from the Cloud. Nope. Thumbnails are hit or miss. These are generated when you press the camera icon on the home screen of the app. I call them snaps, but I've noticed if I am sitting near the Sync 2 Module it can still fail. Full wifi bars too and it still fails.

Alexa:

It is claimed by Blink that the newest generation of their cameras will work with Alexa. I used the app from my phone, but she can't do anything with the cameras (even when trained to use them). In this case you may have to buy an Alexa enabled device (like Show). You technically don't need one they are NOT required for these cameras, but the Alexa app alone on a smartphone is limited.

Finally the recommend having minimum Internet speeds of 2Mb up and down for these cameras, but I believe that is ONLY if you are saving and storing to the cloud along with accessing from the cloud. Locally your access to the Blink cameras will depend on your network speeds along with wifi. The more stuff you have connected the slower it can be.

Conclusion. The Blink Camera System isn't terrible, and they are affordable. There are quirks as I mentioned and annoyances I have dealt with. These are not high end systems but on a tight budget you can get a good start.",negative
233,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,1," FINAL UPDATE: What was once pretty cool and recommended is now completely useless. If you don't subscribe they take away features and the entire system no longer works right.. They want you to pay every month.. $10/month that's $120 a year.. They also want you to link your Amazon account. Make sure to read the fine print.. Blink wants your Amazon data.. I've spent over $2,000 on these cameras.. Now all of it is useless.. Short clips blurred images glitches all the time deleted clips reappear sometimes it doesn't even record no live view saves, sensors don't pick up anything audio goes out, it all turned to trash. They want to blame it on your wifi. 🙄 They are throttling controlling how well your cameras work.. I feel so betrayed and swindled. I've been recommending these cameras even set my parents up told friends now it's all a waste because Blink wants to be shady.. VERY DISAPPOINTING DO NOT REWARD COMPANIES LIKE THIS WITH YOUR MONEY. 👎🤨

UPDATE: 4/28/21 - 8 or so months in. I have purchased 17 of these cameras and 3 sync modules and planned on buying more also purchased many accessories. Different mounting brackets for the cameras and modules wifi extenders larger battery packs etc. They all worked great at first then slowly came the problems. I put up with the failed views the super short recordings that happened now n then the modules going offline repeatedly no its not my internet the glitches etc ... Now something about a PLUS PLAN suddenly pops up on my app. You can no longer save live clips. 😡 One of the cool things was being able to watch something live then being able to save it. You cannot do that simple little thing anymore.

The cloud storage wasn't that big of a deal since you could pop in a thumbdrive to save recordings. Now they want to charge you for the ability to save live views onto your thumbdrive. It was cool and convenient the ability to view something live catch something happening which is the whole point of a camera then saving it. Now if you catch something happening live its useless because you can't save it. 😡 The system has to be armed and you have to hope the sensors pick it up and even then it may not even reset. They ruined the playback on the app now. No thumbnails and if you want to delete you have to delete clips separately no select all option. This is NOT WORTH BUYING anymore. For the amount of money I spent I should be able to save a short live view. I could have purchased a nicer security system for the money I spent. I no longer recommend this system as they want to charge you a monthly fee for a simple feature a doorbell cam can do. At bare minimum they should not charge Prime Members a subscription fee. Very disappointing that they change the functionality so they can charge you for it. My original review and updates are below.
👇😕

This is pretty close to a must have they just need to make some tweaks. 🤙 Picture quality is pretty good. It has a nice dynamic range. The POV is pretty good. Its plenty wide and a little fisheye. For the most part pretty clear. 👍

The audio is fairly decent but you get a lot of humming and hissing. The microphone where you can talk to someone is fairly decent. You're talking about close distance about average distance of someone at your front door.

The setup is pretty easy just install the app and follow the instructions. Let it update the firmware. One tip when you get to the cameras leave the back off because you will have to scan the QR code.

So why not 5 stars since this is pretty cool? The back where you put the batteries screws on and off with a wonky tool they give you. It would be fine if it was a twist lock not an actual screw. The price is kinda steep. I needed 4 cameras. 4 sides to a house or building right? They don't have a 4 camera bundle. 3 or jump to 5. I purchased another single camera because it was only $10 more with a sync module than a add on camera.

Not much security for the camera itself. It just pops off. Anyone can steal it. The camera mount has a limited angle. Its basically made for a straight flat install. I bought separate swivel mounts so I can mount it to the underside of my roof on the side of my house and place the camera looking down the side of my house. They should upgrade the mount. You can always mount the camera higher to avoid theft but sometimes that's limited.

After awhile there's inconsistencies short clip recordings failed views no restart recordings after the pause and the longest you can record is 30 seconds and it won't fully record the full 30 secs. Audio cuts out or doesn't record at all and lots of freezes. 😐

This is a pretty good simple to set up and use camera system. The night vision and motion detection are pretty decent. They should have kept the free cloud storage but i prefer the separate thumbdrive storage. Less chances of hacking being all over the interweb. Using a thumbdrive is not a problem. Maybe they should include one. There's a slight delay in the live shot. Hear something and you wanna click live view you wait a few seconds and by that time the action is gone. They need to make that faster. As for getting notifications instantly when the motion detection is triggered its not bad but there's a delay there too. And it does not recognize or connect to my 5G only to 2.4G on my wifi. 😐 Like I said its pretty decent but could use some improvements and am sure they will continue to do so but for now for what I'm using it for as simple security and being able to monitor my house and yes I can be away and monitor my house from afar yeah definitely worth getting. 👍

UPDATE: Its been a month and a half and the batteries are still good. I do notice not as much hissing and screeching noise. Don't know if that means battery life is going down and the mic is less powered or what but everything still works pretty good. Picked up several of the mini cams as well on sale. Great for inside and the garage. Had one on the patio but it got a little moisture slime. Didn't affect the camera though but I did move it in.

Had one hick up. It said view failed or something like that once and I couldn't get a live view. I just took a photo and it seemed to clear that up. I see a lot of people showing that in the reviews so thought that would help.

I also see a lot of reviews posting pics of bad night vision. You need to reposition your camera. You either have something below it or above it too close to the lens. For example if you have it mounted under an awning and you get a dark picture or you get a foggy looking halo ring you need to bring the camera out further so there is not much covering the top or bottom. The sides are also affected but not as much.

Move it around remember camera position is key for good night vision. Even though it's made for the outdoors you don't want it in direct sunlight where the unit will go passed the 110deg limit. That will kill battery performance and camera capabilities. Hope that helps some of you with those issues. I will update again on battery life. So far its near Thanksgiving and batteries are good. I arm it at night 100% of the time. During the day a little less. I've captured several delivery personnel a raccoon a couple of cats sun glare off my pool some dust looking particles that look like spirits flying away 😄 and of course myself when I forget to disarm 😃 and the battery indicator says OK. They really need a percentage indicator on that. I live view several times a day but only for a few seconds if there's nothing going on.

The cloud thing is not a big deal at all. Get a thumbdrive and you're good to go. All your clips are saved on that instead of the cloud. I love the easy sharing too. I will text my friends with a short clip I can upload straight to my YouTube channel. Its pretty cool. One thing I would like to see is a shorter break between clips. You can miss a lot in 10 seconds. And a longer recording capability than 30sec especially with motion. I know that can eat battery life but they can improve there as well.🖖😉👍

UPDATE 2: I'm getting more failed to connect to cloud indications and I'm not using the cloud I'm using a thumbdrive. I'm also getting more false recordings. Nothing is happening and it will record a clip. Also a live view will pop up in the recorded clip segment. 🤔 Its starting to be a little fidgety but not to the point it upsets me.

UPDATE 3: One of the cameras needed a reset. Pop the batteries out then pop em back in. 🤔 It said failed view or not available something like that. Battery life is going on 3 months with moderate use. What's moderate use? I arm every night and 3 - 5 times a day. Take photos 2 - 3 times and watch live view 4 - 5 times a day. Each live view is for one cycle before it times out or asks to continue. Sometimes I'll watch live view for 3 - 4 times continued. Still haven't needed to replace batteries yet. 👍

Update 4: Colder weather is here and another camera needed a reset where you pop the batteries out wait 30secs and pop em back in. Battery still says ok and its going on 3 and a 1/2 months. It first gave me a failed to load warning here n there and that may be a sign you may need to do a reset.

Update 5: The inconsistencies have increased greatly. The syn module continually goes offline requiring a wifi reboot. The batteries are still good and it's been 6 months. There are more freezes and jumps in recordings.",negative
234,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,4,"I must preface this review by telling all that I am a mechanical klutz but semi-tech savvy. I should also advise that I only received and assembled this product a few hours ago so I will certainly learn more as time passes and I will amend this review accordingly. Having said that, there are a few things that I should mention for the benefit of all other klutz's out there. The first thing I noticed is that there are no detailed instructions! Everyone noted in Amazon revewes how easy installation was so I wasn't all that concerned when placing my order. I should have been. Inexcusable that there were no instructions. I resorted to going to You Tube and found a couple of videos that were very helpful. But even with the videos, I had some very simple but troubling issues. I am after all a klutz.

The first step in installation is to download the Blink app. Much to my surprise, the free Blink app is not compatible with a desktop PC Windows computer. It is primarily an Android app so I was compelled to download the app to my Android phone. Now I realize that most would not have an issue doing that but I wish I had known that because I prefer to control my surveillance systems on my PC. I suspect there may be 3rd party companies that offer Blink compatible software for PC's but again, I wish I had known beforehand. I am still investigating and will likely find a solution to use the app on my PC but for now, can only use compatible devices.

The cameras and the module are all wrapped in a thin and almost invisible plastic wrap. One of the first steps is to install the provided 2 Lithium AA batteries in the rear of each of the cameras. I finally figured out how to get the back plate/cover off the camera and it was a little frustrating. First, you should know that there is a rubber plug that covers the screw which holds the back plate. You need to take that plug out to access the screw. The kit provided a plastic key that fits into the screw and can be used to unscrew the screw. Simple right? Well, I turned and turned and turned the screw but the back plate would not come off. I finally figured out that there was a very thin and invisible plastic that wrapped around the edges of the camera body and that it had to be removed because it otherwise prevented the back plate from releasing once it was unscrewed. Yes, you have to have had eagle eyes to have seen that plastic film and it was a little tricky getting it off. (I warned you that I was a klutz.) Ok, so now that I removed the plastic, I found a notch in the back plate to help lift it out of the camera body. That now revealed the slots where to install the batteries and the slots were adequately marked to show polarity positions. But after you install the batteries - do not screw the cover back on. Why? Because you need to access the camera ID serial numbers. Again, I had to find this out on my own because there were no instructions! Also know that once you do screw the back plate back on, it should be orientated properly and there is only one way that will happen even though the cover will go on any way. The easiest way to orient the plate correctly is to ensure that the USB C port opening lines up with the USB C port on the camera.

Synching the module and each of the cameras was relatively easy so I won't belabor these steps. The You Tube videos were very helpful to get through these steps. But here's another setup klutz problem I came across. To mount the cameras, there are mounting bases that attach to the back of the camera body by snapping into that area where the screw is located. Sounds easy enough but it is a little tricky. First, understand that the mounts need to be screwed into whatever house structure your attaching the camera to. But the holes in the mount are situated in such a manner that it is impossible to access the holes once the camera is attached. So you need to first screw the mount on to the wall before attaching the camera. The only problem with that is you now have to snap the camera on to the mount and as I mentioned above, that was a little difficult.

OK, now that I had the cameras set up, figuring out how to work the system was another stumbling block. Again - no guidance because no instructions. Even being a little tech savvy, I had some difficulty. I found that the software was not as user friendly as I would have expected. OK, I am still playing with the system and learning but once again, it sure would help having instructions.",positive
235,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,5,"When we first purchased cams back in 2017, we compared to Arlo and Ring before we chose Blink. Now we are up to 10 cams, covering every angle of the house. Here are my findings after using them for almost 4 years (and still buying more):
PROS:
> #1 video quality is excellent. Day time is a bit better than night, but night vision is as good as it gets with cams. POSITION of your cam matters a ton. I started out putting them way high up and quickly realized - if you actually want identifying features - they need to be lower. Otherwise... yeah you see someone walking past, but you cant ID anything, so what is the use.
> So inexpensive - so easy to integrate. Anytime we have ANYTHING we need to cover, we just order another cam and it literally takes 5 minutes to get it out of the box, batteries in, and added to existing system.. seriously - 5 minutes.
> The app is great. Very intuitive. Our first cams had very few ""advanced features"" every time i order new cams, they have improved their features. Now you are able to zoom all the way in to very small areas, to capture certain areas and exclude others.. For example - old cams you had to block off large sections of the capture area to avoid the cams picking up movement from trees, but now you can pinpoint one little part of a branch on a tree to exclude if its triggering the cam.
> Motion detection is very sensitive - but they have it tweaked just about right. It never misses anything, but if you setup your exclusion zones well - you can get it almost perfect. I dont have a lot of false alarms and I'm running 10 cams. We have one setup to look at the sidewak, and after much tweaking, we can actually exclude the street... but pick up both sidewalks on both sides of the street. You can setup the app to alert you or not alert you.. you can turn sound on or off on alerts. On windy days I do end up just going into the app and turning off all cams that are setup around lots of trees until the storm is over.. but thats like a few times a year.
> Super easy playback and control of cams. It's instant - you can control them in any way, very easily. If I am working on a project in the yard, I dont want my cams on for hours, running out of batteries - so I just go into the app and turn them all off. It takes seconds. Likewise - if i hear a noise at night, super easy to open the app and live view any cam so i can look all around the house and see everything happening outside, from every angle.
> Extremely easy to move around. We have had them for years - so we move them around occasionally. I even had mice in our crawlspace under the house at one point and just grabbed one of the cams off the side of the house and stuck it down there so I could catch them at night. Theres no commitment with these - no hard wiring so you can mount them anywhere and taking them on and off the mount takes 2 seconds.
> No subscription needed to store clips. thats BIG for us. We would not like blink as much if they changed that. We run a lot of cams and it just stays 100% full storage - we can still access a few weeks worth of video, it just deletes oldest. You can download/save any videos.
> Lots of mounting options. You have to buy them separately if you want anything special, but I have 3 different types of mounts - one for trees, one around porches that need to be secured so they cant be taken, and then the standard mounts for cams not at risk of being taken. There are camo skins as well - I have on in a tree that you pretty much cant see unless you know its there.
> Customer support is super decent. In the winter of 2018, one of my cams took on a green hue to the image when the temp went down to about 10 degrees outside. I emailed customer service explaining the issue and sent a screenshot and within 24 hours they asked me for the SN of the cam, and did a firmware update that fixed it. I was quite happy with that.
CONS:
> So while the batteries are awesome because the cams are so easy to move around and deal with... i blow through batteries. Fortunately, i just get 20 packs of AA's, but with 10 cams - even though Blink ~says~ batteries can last a year? it totally depends on usage. So we get LOTS of traffic on our front cams because we live in a busy area and have people walking past all day. I change out the batteries on every one of those front cams once a month. Granted - thats many hundreds of video captures and ideally, we should connect those cams to electricity somehow - that is an option with blink, but I dont mind changing batteries. On the cams in the back yard and side paths - I really can go once or twice a year changing those, except for the ones that catch a lot of foot traffic. So the battery usage is totally dependent on traffic. Personally - the cams are a big deal to me, so i dont mind it at all. Benefits totally outweigh the downsides.
> The biggest difference between Blink and some other companies is that i see other people with hardwired cams that can catch EVERYTHING in a continuous fashion, for hours. like the surveillance videos you see online where the cam just happened to catch something happening down the street...Blink doesnt work that way. it only captures immediate video clips, triggered by motion activation. It does store all videos.. you can see something weird in your yard and look back through videos to find out what happened - but it isnt 24 hours of continuous video feed.
> You can get gaps in your videos. So it can capture 1 minute of video at a time, but then it takes a small break before it starts capturing again, so if something is happening and its videotaping an event - it will record an entire minute of excellent footage - but then it takes a 5 second break before it starts recording again. that doesnt sound like a long time, and for security it's not normally an issue.. the average bad guy is in and out quickly.. but it is annoying that it takes 5 seconds to re-trigger. So.... 2 minutes of continuous video... but in the middle of that 2 minutes.. a 5 second break.
OVERALL - Super high video quality... cams you can move around super easily... a very easy app... I love blink and the upsides far outweigh any downsides. I always recommend it to people when they ask. You can cover your entire house at a super affordable price, you dont need to be rich at all.. Our 3 year old cams are still as good as our brand new ones. The peace of mind the cams bring me is priceless. I know every single thing happening everywhere, all the time outside. The affordability made it possible so that nothing can ever surprise us.",positive
236,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,5," We've got some bad actors in the hood, so it was time to catch them with some irrefutable evidence. Our XT2 is a little old and our Arlos are acting stupid. Saw this come out and had to give it a shot. It was time to upgrade. Plus, the specs of the possibility of TWO YEAR BATTERY LIFE is mindblowing. It's probably a lot less, but my Arlos would last a week with $10 CR123 batteries, so that had to go. Anything had to be better than those dinosaurs.

Set up was fairly easy. There is no real printed instruction manual, but those are rare today. Scanned the QR code and my smartphone popped me to their website with tons of tips, info, and even setup videos. The entire setup process is QR from the new Sync Module 2 to the camera itself. So don't make the mistake of slapping the batteries in and closing the camera unit like I did before I scanned the QR code. Whoops. Took less than 15 minutes to setup and sync. Signed up for a new Blink account so the old one won't get confused - plus there's several weeks of free cloud storage right now. Boom.

Set it up in a tree ACROSS from my house this time. When I put it over my door, my old cameras would flag every car or pedestrian close and far. All I want to see is the jerk stealing my UPS packages, so I flipped the perspective. The HD is super clean and clear, and the camera is at least 30 feet from the sync module with no problems connecting. Big plus there. And, there's a pretty powerful little speaker in this unit! I was really surprised at the volume this thing can push for such a small speaker. Now, when this alerts me to funny business, maybe I'll be able to yell at the perps. Probably not, because they'll be long gone by the time I see the notification. Still, this feature could be useful in warning your kids from doing something silly when you're not home.

The live view was disappointing, since you have to keep clicking the app to continue the live view for longer than 10-ish seconds. So you can't use this as a spying device or a baby monitor. Bummer. Also, the default recording time was like 5 seconds, probably to maximize battery life. You can't catch much in 5 seconds. I adjusted mine in the settings to about 20 seconds. I'll sacrifice battery life to catch a bad actor. Plus, there's a battery pack you can attach to this unit to increase battery life. I'll update in the future to let you know how the battery goes.

Overall, I'm impressed with the new Blink outdoor. It's gonna rain here in Florida soon, so I'll let you know how that goes as well as night shots when available.",positive
237,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,5,"I was fortunate to buy in early on the Blink camera system. Therefore, I have the included cloud coverage. Only recently did I find out just what an advantage that was.

After buying my initial system, I continued to add cameras to the initial sync module. I ultimately ended up having two additional sync modules from systems I purchased after the original system. I was under the impression that all my cameras had to be connected to the original sync module to continue receiving free cloud coverage.

I currently have a mixture of cameras to include 3-XT2, 4-Outdoor, 1-Indoor (2nd gen) and 2-Mini. I was using a schedule to arm the cameras, but I was disappointed that the system would not allow individual scheduling for each camera.

I recently decided to use my additional sync modules to divide my cameras into different zones and allow myself to set different schedules for each zone. Even if it meant the additional modules would not include free cloud coverage, I felt the scheduling control would be worth it.

I was happily surprised to find that even the newer modules set up under the original system included free cloud coverage. Therefore, I now have three different zones that can be individually scheduled. And furthermore, I can add up to 10 cameras to each module.

I only ran into one problem with the setup. The second module I had purchased had been sitting in the box for probably about a year. When I tried to add a camera to it, it would not connect. I called customer support and the first person wasn’t able to help me. I decided to investigate the problem myself and noticed there was a huge difference in the firmware on the second module.

I expected that the firmware of the second module would automatically update, and there was no way to initiate an update within the App. Since it didn’t automatically update, I called customer service back and told them the problem. The individual I spoke with didn’t seem to understand the issue, so I simply insisted that the module’s firmware had to be updated by them.

It took a number of increments to finally update the firmware once the issue had been escalated to the appropriately skilled technician. I insisted that the customer service representative stay on the line until the firmware of the second module exactly matched that of the existing module. I wasn’t trying to go through another 30 minute hold and 20 minute update again.

After the firmware was updated, I was able to add cameras to the second module. I will monitor the module to make sure future firmware updates occur.

I realize that the cloud coverage or camera support may change or discontinue in the future. But for the time being, I’m quite happy with my Blink system.",positive
238,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,3,"I've purchased a total of 4 Blink Outdoor + 3 Blink Mini cameras, plus a sync module and USB backup drive for the security system at my retail space. It's honestly probably the best and easiest way to get a security system installed without wires at a small business. Yes I have used Ring, and Canary. I prefer Blink. Since I’ve seen this now at brick and mortar retail locations, in addition to Amazon, I figure a review might help you make an informed purchase (spoiler, I love it).

This review really supports all of Blink’s camera products, as an ecosystem, though Amazon strangely would only let me review the standalone “Outdoor” camera. So you can infer details to the rest of Blink’s product lineup. You should know that Amazon purchased Blink in 2018, so I hope it gets some attention with new software features and hardware refresh.

Pros:
* Wireless. As long as you have reasonably good wifi, the cameras work. I use a mesh system to cover 6000+ sq ft of space, and all the cameras record and alert me.
* Battery. The outdoor cameras run on 2 AA lithium batteries. I don’t know how, but they last WAY longer than comparable rechargeable batteries for competing camera brands
* Price. Blink’s system is very price competitive. The mini cameras are downright cheap. The Outdoor cameras are competitive, considering how long the battery lasts, how small they are, how easy they are to install, and the superb reliability.
* Footage. Blink paid plan is cheap and stores a month of
* App. It’s simple and straightforward. Easy to view alert footage, and pull up recent footage. Wish it was easier to organize/review past footage… once you’re past a week it get tedious and hectic to find anything quickly and efficiently.
* Communication: You can speak into your phone with the app open and have a 2-way conversation with any party present at individual cameras. I’ve used this feature to communicate with staff, and also warn maleficent actors to leave the premises before I notify authorities.
* Sensitivity: You can customize a bunch of the toggles for camera recording, active area, sensitivity etc which is great. It’s not quite as intuitive as Ring or Canary which literally let you draw areas to avoid or record, but the toggles for the recording area as well as sensitivity triggers, recording length, quality, notification lights, etc are intuitive and great.

Cons:
* Multiple Locations: Currently Blink does not allow you to have multiple locations for your Blink system. This is a real bummer because I would easily buy this same system for my home, office, and to help keep an eye on my elderly parents at their house. Unfortunately you can’t. To do this you have to have a separate Blink account for each location, and manually log out and then log in to the location you want to pay attention to. That defeats the purpose of a security system, if you can’t receive timely notifications from all of your security cameras. If you have to manually review footage, it’s too late to help.
* User Access: Another big annoyance is you can’t selectively invite users to access your account with different access permissions. So currently I am the only person reviewing my Blink account. It would be a big help to delegate managers and other authorized administrators, especially in a multi-location environment where you want your family to have access to home security, your staff access to office security, but don’t want those groups to see the other cameras. I hope Blink implements robust user invitations and sharing access once Multiple Locations is supported.
* Geo-Fencing: There is no geolocated ability to arm, disarm, or set location-based trigger schedules for Blink. It’s either time, or manual arming or disarming. I also use a Canary system, and one of the big perks is the ability to have the system automatically switch gears if you or particular people come and go from a location. Wish I could do that for Blink, to have it automatically arm itself with the most sensitive settings when my staff leaves the location for the night.
* Auto-Delete: Once your USB drive is full, expect daily notifications that “local storage is full”. It asks you to delete footage to make room for more, which is pointless, because at the end of each day it will automatically do this (since the USB drive automatically clears old footage as needed, but still sends the annoying notification about storage being full).

Other:
* Neighbors App: Integrates with a community, I don’t use this much, but great feature to have especially for neighborhood safety.
* Amazon: You purchase your premium subscription through Amazon, and link your Amazon account to your Blink account.
* Alexa Integration: I use a series of Alexa devices with screens throughout the retail space to quickly look at cameras if I get an alert with my phone. Take a second to wake each camera (especially battery-operated Outdoor cams), and is very useful for safety and suspicious activity.
* Outdoor Mount: The outdoor cameras can be easily “popped” off their mount, if a maleficent person knows what’s up and decides to take a camera.
* Battery Life: The battery life of Blink Outdoor with 2 AA Lithium is good enough to not be a con. However the battery life is significantly less than “2 years” advertised. So far I’ve had to change the batteries on all four of my Outdoor cameras about every 3-4 months. Unfortunately there’s no alert or indicator to tell you if the battery is about to die. It’s either “OK” or the camera goes offline (with a slow blinking red light on the physical device).

VERDICT:

Blink is a great system, I totally recommend it as long as you only have one location and you are the sole user. The price is great, the performance is reliable with quality coverage, and it’s comparable, if not better than competitors.

If you need security systems at multiple residences or other locations, want to automate the system arming/triggers based on your geo-location, and need to invite and grant specific access to different people (friends vs staff) you should definitely avoid Blink and look to Canary or Ring for a security solution.

If the three major cons were address I would easily increase my rating from 3 to 5 stars. I hope Blink (and Amazon) is listening!",fair
239,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 2 camera kit",$114.99,4,"I've only had these outdoor cameras for a few days, so I won't comment on battery life yet. But overall, I'm very happy with these cameras and most of their features. I'm nitpicking a bit here, which is why there are so many Cons. They are minor issues outweighed by the Pros.

PROS:
* Setup was relatively simple--once you understand it--but the instructions weren't (see below)
* Infrared is awesome in the darkest environments and does a good job switching between IR and non-IR automatically
* Motion detection works well, as does the 1-9 sensitivity setting, although this requires some tweaking until you find the right setting for each camera
* Daytime video quality is excellent and good enough to read stationary license plates up to about 50 feet.
* Audio quality is amazing! Individual birds and nearby bees can be heard easily, and normal volume conversations within about 20 feet can be understood.

CONS:
* The cameras seem to require an active Internet connection, not just a wifi connection (although I could be wrong). This may be because the initial setup requires you to use cloud storage. This could become a problem if your Internet connection is lost or dropped.
* Initial setup requires storage in the cloud (for the free trial), even if you install a USB drive in the sync module. I have not found a way to disable the cloud storage. This cloud storage requirement may be slowing down the entire system, since it forces everything to constantly use the Internet.
* Setup instructions were weird and unintuitive. The included booklet simply said to install the app. And the app is kind of confusing at first, and I ended up trying to create an account (and failing) and adding the sync module several times until I figured out what it was doing (and I'm an experienced techie). The basic problem is the app requires cameras to be installed only by following certain steps, with no other option.
* Setup requires the mobile app and an active internet connection to install the cameras.
* Accessing the cameras and video clips requires the mobile app. There are no desktop app or web options.
* Cannot schedule individual cameras. The weekly/hourly schedule can only be set for all cameras attached to a sync module. This is unfortunate and will make the scheduling feature useless for most people. It would also be helpful to be able to set quality, motion detection sensitivity, and IR settings on a schedule. The settings I use for night time would be different than the middle of the day or when I'm not at home.
* No quality setting on the audio. There are multiple settings for quality of the videos, to conserve batteries, but there's no way to turn down the audio quality, for battery conservation. The included audio quality is great, but it seems to be ""too"" high for the purpose of these cameras.
* Only 2 AA batteries in each camera. This could become very cumbersome to replace batteries if your camera is installed in a hard-to-reach location. The cameras SHOULD have 6, 8, or 10 batteries instead, so you don't have to replace them often. I would happily pay the extra battery cost so that I wouldn't have to climb up there very often.
* When a camera is ""in use"", its settings cannot be changed, and if you try to change the settings, you'll get an error message, causing the app's settings screen to get out of sync with the camera's actual settings, until you go back and modify the settings again.
* The ""Talk"" feature produces garbled, broken, delayed (by 3-5 seconds) audio that is unintelligible, no matter how close the camera and sync module are to your router. I have about 115 Mbps bandwidth, and it made no difference. You will never be able to use this to have a conversation of any type, even if they could understand what you're saying. This seems like a very odd flaw since the recorded audio is so excellent. This was obviously an oversight by the engineers.
* The Android app's setting to disable the vibration on notifications doesn't work. It always uses my phone's setting and ignores the app's setting.
* Insects near my 4 cameras are causing 15-30 false alerts per day right now, until I can figure out a better placement or setting. Other than the wear on the batteries, this is not a huge deal, but it can be annoying.
* The installation hardware is inadequate. Each camera comes with 2 large wood screws that are too big and too long for almost every installation. Much smaller wood screws and double-sided tape or Velcro would have been much more practical. I ended up not using any of the screws that came with the cameras because they were too big or impossible to use on the required surfaces.
* The back panels on the cameras are VERY weird to remove for battery installation. There are no instructions that I could find on how to do this, and the included plastic tools are not intuitive. I nearly broke one of the cameras trying to get the back panel off using the included tool. There's a certain trick to hooking and unhooking the tool from the back panel that you'll have to figure out on your own.
* The cameras and lenses are fully exposed to sunlight and weather, which is not ideal. The cameras should come with a small hood the lens or camera to protect it even more from weather and shade from light.
* User access cannot be customized. The only way to give someone access to a camera is to give them your password to your account and entire system. It would be helpful to be able to grant someone limited or temporary access, such as a neighbor, child, relative, or visitor.",positive

260,Electronics,"Alarm Clock for Bedroom, 2 Alarms Loud LED Big Display Clock with USB Charging Port, Adjustable Volume, Dimmable, Snooze, Plug in Simple Basic Digital Clock for Deep Sleepers Kids Elderly Home Office",$16.99,5,"I previously had a radio/alarm clock with battery backup where the battery backup stopped working. We have frequent power interruptions, so I wanted an alarm with battery backup. I don't ever use the radio feature, so one with just alarm was sufficient. And I like having two alarm settings. This clock fit the bill at a reasonable price, and other reviews seemed good. I like that all the routinely used time and alarm controls are easily accessible on the top. Some other alarm clocks have these settings on the back, which is inconvenient. The clock and alarm times are easy to set, and controls are obvious and intuitive. The ""Dimmer"" button allows you to easily adjust the brightness of the display. When Alarm 1 and/or 2 is set, little images appear on the left side of the screen showing they are on. Pressing the ""Alarm Off"" button turns these off (press once if only one alarm is set, press again if both are set). To set the alarms, press the one you want to set (Alarm 1 or Alarm 2), and the display will start flashing. Use the hour and minute buttons to set. Once set, the time will continue to flash for a few seconds then hold at what you set. Or you can press the alarm button again or the ""Snooze/OK"" button to stop the flashing and register your setting. You can adjust the alarm volume with the Volume +/- buttons on the left side of the clock. A tone is sounded each time you press so you can hear the volume. When the alarm goes off, pressing the Snooze button will give you an extra 9 minutes until it goes off again. Or you can press the ""Alarm Pause"" or ""Alarm Off"" button. ""Alarm Pause"" turns off the particular alarm (1 or 2) for 24 hours so it won't beep again until the next day. ""Alarm Off"" turns it off so it won’t beep again until you turn it back on. Once you set times for the Alarm 1 and Alarm 2, these times are retained each time you turn them off and back on, unless you change them. (This seems obvious, but I mention it only because one review I read seemed to indicate this might not be the case.) You can tell if Alarm 1 and/or 2 is set to go off by whether the small icons on the left side of the screen are showing. If an alarm is off, just press the Alarm 1 and/or 2 button to turn back on. The icon will then display on the screen.

There is a button on the right side of the clock to toggle modes between either 12 hour (AM/PM) or 24 hour (e.g., military time). Also, if you hold this button in for about 3 seconds, it will add an hour to the current time and display a little ""DST"" (daylight savings time) symbol on the right side of the face (i.e., ""Spring forward""). Pressing it again for about 3 seconds will subtract an hour and remove the DST symbol (i.e., ""Fall back""). This saves having to re-set the time twice a year. All very logical and intuitive.

One other thing to mention. Several unboxing videos by some reviewers seem to wonder what the two little black square pieces are that are packaged with the clock. I'm not sure why this seems confusing. These are obviously feet. They each have a little post on them, and there are a couple of holes in the back of the clock to insert them. These are easy to insert and fit snugly. They provide a little more width to the base to make the clock more stable, so it won't tip over when you go to hit the Snooze or Alarm Pause or Off buttons.

The only slight negative observation I have is that the display can be a little glary and washed out in bright sunlight when viewed from across the room. Making the display brighter helps, but then it is too bright if you wake up and look at the time during the night. As a result, I tend to set the display brightness towards one of the middle settings. This is obviously a personal preference that will vary. All-in-all, this is a nice little alarm clock with big numbers that are easy to read without glasses at a very reasonable/inexpensive price.",positive

The clock numbers are big and thus super bright... a little too bright for a bedroom for my liking, but am living with it just fine. If you need big #s, this is definitely a winner. I'm kind of wishing I got something with smaller #s because of the excessive brightness, but that is a personal preference.

Idk if I did something wrong or if that's it's generic function, but if I were to get another one in the future, I'd definitely try to find one that works without needing to be plugged in to a power source.

Thinking you can just plug it into the wall and leave it alone doesn't work. There are too many variables to your home electricity to keep a steady pace.

It was new and everything in the box was sealed. I had everything transferred from my old iPad to the new and so far it runs very smooth. The picture/color quality and battery life are amazing! Much better than the gen 7. It arrived on the day I specified. Thanks again Apple and Amazon! UPDATE: Charged it for the first time this morning and it was fast. Was on 35% and took about 40 minutes.

282,Electronics,"2021 Apple 10.2-inch iPad (Wi-Fi, 64GB) - Silver",[],5,"I bought the 256GB model ""used"" from Amazon Warehouse for $52 off the new price. From what I can tell, I simply received a returned unit. The item was described as having multiple cosmetic defects, however, all I saw was a few small scratches on the Apple logo which doesn't bother me. I was able to buy Apple Care for this iPad after receiving it, which means it was less than 90 days old when it got to me. Essentially I got a brand new iPad for $52 off.

As far as the device its self, especially at $300 for the 64GB model, I think the standard iPad can be a great deal depending on your use case. In my case I wanted something to watch videos on, do school work, and edit videos. The iPad can handle all that for me, and is cheaper than a decent laptop.

There are a couple things I find funny about the base model iPad. It's a 2021 device, but yet it lacks a 5G cellular option. I wouldn't consider this a big deal since I would just tether off my phone if I needed to, but it is worth noting since this is a 2021 device. It also doesn't feature NFC. Lastly, there is no Face ID, but touch ID is fine in all reality.

I only got the 256GB because of the lower price used and I plan to do RAW photo editing on this device, so I would prefer to have more local storage. The 64GB would be fine for someone who uses the device mainly for streaming, and at $300, I think is a great price.",positive

300,Electronics,"Sceptre 24"" Professional Thin 75Hz 1080p LED Monitor 2x HDMI VGA Build-in Speakers, Machine Black (E248W-19203R Series)",$103.35,5,"I have bought sceptre monitors in the past, and I stand by them as a great budget monitor company if you want something that's reliable and inexpensive. I purchased these monitors as secondary monitors and vertical monitors for my setup. From my experience, I knew that these monitors would be good for work other than gaming, so I primarily use them for watching videos, discord, or just as an extra screen for when I am doing work. I overall enjoy these monitors, but I have two major issues that I had first when I got them.

I love the monitors, and they could be a 5-star product if they tweaked a couple of things. I will talk first about the main advantages of the monitors first. Firstly, for $150, you are getting a monitor with decent viewing angles and a good size with 75hz refresh rate viewing. For the price, it is a very good monitor alone for office or schoolwork. It does its job very well and anybody who is doing basic work or maybe some console gaming would have a good experience with these monitors. Furthermore, they are VESA mount* (more on that below), and it has a good display, with a speaker that although quiet, does the job well without sounding blown out. Overall, it is a good monitor, and anybody who wants something basic will enjoy this monitor.

Here are the cons from my experience, as it had a couple off the start. I first opened the box to find that it talks about its return policy on the box. This was extremely concerning since it is almost impossible to send this monitor back. Please keep everything (including box and packaging materials) for the first month you own the monitor. The second issue I had was the mounting brackets you get with the monitor. For one thing, the monitor uses a separate monitor arm, that is screwed into a bracket that comes out of the monitor. If you plan on not using any desk mounts or VESA mounting, then you will have no problem with this monitor. However, I wanted to mount this monitor to a VESA desk mount to use as a vertical monitor. My first issue came when I tried to mount the monitor, when I tried to mount the monitor to the arm by screwing in the screws provided with the arm. The first issue comes with the hardware included with the monitor, there are four standoffs and two monitor screws, but the arm needed four screws, so we already are set back. I found some old monitor screws that fit, and when I mounted the monitor, I realized that the monitor wouldn't fit due to the bracket secured on the back, which sticks out of the monitor to make more viewing angles. Again, this won't be an issue for those who are planning on not using any VESA mounting, however, it makes the process a lot more difficult for those who are planning on doing any mounting of their monitor with a third party device. It took me like 20 minutes before I realized that the standoffs that are included are for VESA mounting, which although makes some sense, also makes me question why to include the mounting bracket externally when it could have been included inside of the monitor since there is a cutout section that fits it.

I see this question a lot, and I feel that I should address it here for those who want to game on this monitor: get a different monitor. First, this monitor is a 75hz 5ms, meaning it refreshes the screen 75 times in one second, and it responds 5ms after the information has been sent by the PC. There are plenty of 144hz monitors with a 1ms response time for this price, and I recommend that you look for something at that price. If you want something to game on for the long run, get a 144hz monitor at the same price, it'll work better overall, and be around the same budget.

Overall I highly enjoy this monitor. I give it four stars since it works very well for what I need it to do, and although it has its flaws I wouldn't want another monitor. It could have been five stars, only if the price was a little bit cheaper. The price does go up with the blue light shift that occurs, but the $133 option is still a little overpriced, I would personally price this around $115 and it would be the ultimate monitor for the price. Overall, if you want a monitor for office work, then please consider this, it's a great monitor.",positive

My office has much larger ones and thought this was a sign I should finally upgrade and get the same screen size at home as I do in the office. But since my old monitors lasted a LONG time without paying a lot, I wanted to repeat that experience. Lots of research and talking to other people led me to similar conclusion: not a lot out there at a cheap price for larger sizes for people that just need a large working screen and not concerned about graphics and gaming.
I had not heard of the Scepter brand before so I was a bit dubious. But as I talked about my search with others, some programmers mentioned they HAD heard of them and were reputable. They were about the best price and reviews largely good, so the programmer endorsement was what I needed to pull the trigger.

I'm very happy with these monitors! Easy to set up. Great resolution and color. SO MUCH LIGHTER than my old ones. I had to adjust the tension in my mounting arms accordingly. I went with the standard, automatice calibration and haven't felt the need to fiddle with additional settings. I'm an account/project manager that deals in spreadsheets, project management tools, Microsoft suite (Excel, Work, Outlook), and Adobe Creative Suite (Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Photoshop), and other custom tools for digital design, programming and management.

One thing I liked, and needed, is that the mounting screwholes on the back of the monitors are on the BOTTOM of the screen...rather than the middle or towards the top, which seems to be more standard. This actually helped me get the monitors to the height I wanted with the mount I have without haveing to replace that too. Works great for me, but might be a consideration for others, depending on how you plan to mount them.",positive

I was thinking that the monitor was defective when I saw it, but, after some homework, figured out that the problem is caused by faulty ""overdrive"" feature (or maybe not faulty? never actually saw this feature before). The control for ""Overdrive"" is under ""System"" and it's set to ""medium"" by default. Turn it off. Then the problem of blurry screen will go away and after that, the monitor is great. (While I can't speak to the durability of this particular product, I've had generally excellent experience with Scepter monitors, all of which (I've had 4, including this one) were very durable over 3-4 years that I've used them. At minimum, they products are worth it, IMHO.

*Original review below:

The short version is that the monitor is great (it is, fwiw, the most economical FHD monitor available), but some of the features don't seem to be working quite right. One specific problem that came out right away was that the ""Overdrive"" feature is not working properly: when you hook it up to your computer, you will find that objects on the monitor get blurry momentarily when you scroll. After some searching, I found out that this is due to the overdrive feature that's supposed to speed up the response time...except, in this case, it's just making objects blurrier as they move with the mouse scroll. The overdrive is set to ""medium"" in the factory setting. You want to turn it off as the first thing you do. After that, you should be happy.",positive

So far, very happy with the purchase.

Could not manage to make the monitor tilt backward.

Even with all the other features—hdmi and VGA ports, audio features, etc—if I can't adjust the angle for basic ergonomic purposes, this can't be my monitor. Likely going to return, unless the seller can manage to resolve this issue.

EDIT: So I tried to change the tilt again, this time using the neck to ""wrench"" the metal joint.

Another issue I have is that it's not as crisp as the LG, when watching videos the image is slightly more crisp and cooler as far as color. Overall this monitor is a great beginner monitor if you buy it at the $90 that I did, just make sure that if you are running a dual monitor setup that you have a stand that let's you adjust the height of the monitors individually because the VESA mount is low on the monitor and that most likely will put it at a higher viewing angle than your other monitor... trust me I know.",positive
310,Electronics,"livho 2 Pack Blue Light Blocking Glasses, Computer Reading/Gaming/TV/Phones Glasses for Women Men,Anti Eyestrain & UV Glare",$15.98 - $39.98,4,"For some reason, lately, either I've been on my various devices TOO much or I'm developing some sort of sensitivity, I started getting headaches and eye stress whenever I looked at a screen of any kind. I'm on my computer (work/personal) as well as my phone and tablet, so avoiding any of those is just not feasible.

While I am trying to decrease mindless screen-time and other ways to cope (low light levels, not holding my phone right up to my face, etc) my eye doctor suggested blue light tinted glasses when I wear my contacts and possibly get that feature on a pair of new glasses.

I bought these on a whim after an hour's worth of researching and all these glasses seemed really similar in look and reviews. I did want something stylish as I'd wear them often but also funcitonal. I knew I didn't want the yellow-tinted glasses and literally just bought these with my fingers crossed and expected them to not work.

Not only did you get 2 pairs (a lot of choices to choose from too! I got the clear and dark tortoise pattern), you get protective sleeves (granted, will only prevent the lines from getting scratched and that's about it), a small eye glass screw you can attach to your keyring (!), AND a blue light to test out your glasses (which I did, and my glasses passed--yay!).

SOOOOOO, the REAL test is wearing them and seeing if they help (i.e., reduce my headaches and eye strain). And the verdict...?

THESE WORK.

I'm so shocked tbh cuz these were rather cheap. But honestly, these glasses LOOK good and are made of thick, durable plastic. I get compliments on both pairs since I got them a couple weeks ago. There is a slight difference when you put them on (a very subtle yellow-ish/gold tint) but it's not at all distracting or so different when wearing them or not. The first week, I didn't notice too much of a difference (to be fair, I kept forgetting to wear them). By the second week--these glasses have become a game-changer. I'm used to wearing them on the regular and can use my devices and watch TV and be on my computer for longer and less headaches. When I'm not wearing them, like at night and wearing my regular glasses, I get a headache after a half hour so these glasses help alleviate it a lot.

Do I still get headahes? Yes, esp if I am staring at a screen a lot but the headaches aren't as strong and not as distracting. Basically, if I'm wearing these glasses and start noticing that pressure in my forehead and behind my eyes, I know I've been on the screen too much and take a long break.

One issue i have--and possibly contributing to my headache--is that these glasses are a bit heavy on my nose bridge. Now, to be transparent, I do have a narrow, small bridge and it sits slightly lower than where the arms of the glasses fit over my ears so sometimes, certain glass style cause added pressure where it sits on my nosebridge. To be clear, I don't have this issue with all glasses so something about this design is adding to that heavy feeling on my nosebridge and I at times, I have to take them off to give my nose bridge a rest, which is kind of a bummer but hopefully I'll get used to it.

My chief complaint is how tight the arms press against the side of my head. I might have a larger head for these glasses so I used the mini-screw driver and loosened the screws enough to lessen that pressure and hopefully, that'll take care of it feeling so tight against my head.

All in all--quite pleased with this product. Just relieved it worked for me!",positive

Didn't take the time off of my job where I stare at multiple computer monitors all day (Boo!). I thought I was just going to tough it out, but by day 2 of doing so, I realized I needed to do something.
Reviews for this were good, there were several other reviews mentioning LASIK, so I pulled the trigger
So, initial thoughts
These do work. There was another review that 1 starred them because they made their vision seem 'off'. I get where they are coming from. With the filtration of the light, things seem flatter. It's not too bad, once you recognize what's happening. But it does seem weird, at first.
Now for the main concern. Eye strain and glare. While I won't say that these cut out all of the glare (keeping in mind that I'm less than a week post surgery, as I type this), I will say that they do a reasonable job. Combined with the 20/20/20 rule, I think these will allow me to function normally. Before, I was looking away after 5 minutes. And that was after tinkering incessantly with my monitors to find the best combination. Now, I can look at them back on standard settings, with mild redshift, and I'm no longer getting glare or haloing on dark mode apps (such as slack), and minimal on light mode apps (such as chrome, running Salesforce or Google Sheets).

I was worried that the tint would bother me when playing, but actually its quite the opposite...when I take the glasses off my eyes hurt looking at my screen! The eyeglass tint is like a good night mode on a computer screen. I can wear these comfortably for hours. And even though I have had these less than a week, I have already worn them for over a dozen of hours in front of the screen and have not found them to be uncomfortable once and I am sensitive to how glasses fit generally! I would recommend these gaming glasses.

update: after about 2 or so weeks of wear I did notice behind the ear soreness. For some reason I did not notice before, but then it became all I could focus on. I figured out that if I situate the eyeglass arms to sit higher up on my head I don't get any soreness and they stay put. I ended up buying some silicone temple tips (also purchased on amazon) and was able to wear the eyeglasses normally without pain so far, its pretty comfortable. Also, it did not pass the RGB color model test. According to the test, with the blue light glasses on, the images should appear ""almost identical"", however, the left image has more blue visible and it is even more apparent in person. I will say though, I do appreciate the yellow tint of the glasses because I do feel like the screen bothers me less while I am looking at it, so for that it was money well spent. I might look into spending more money on a Gunnar pair in the future.",positive

319,Electronics,"livho 2 Pack Blue Light Blocking Glasses, Computer Reading/Gaming/TV/Phones Glasses for Women Men,Anti Eyestrain & UV Glare",$15.98 - $39.98,4,"Wanted to try blue light filtering glasses at an easy price as I just recently started getting noticeable headaches (from what, I don't know.) These are quite impressive. For anyone wondering, these are not blue blockers (the fancy sunglasses that make the world yellow) but blue light filters. I still see some blue color but it is noticeably muted. Wearing these blue light filters casts a realistic version of that yellow instagram filter, making the world look warm and inviting. And then when I remove them, the white walls of my house appear brighter. So there is definitely some blue filtering going on.

I didn't read the product description very carefully so I was pleasantly surprised to get the little blue light and tester card. The glasses shielded the card from the blue light as expected and now I have a bonus cat toy. I also received a mini dual-head eyeglass screwdriver, which is a very nice touch.

The fit is nice and they are super lightweight. I picked up the faux-tortoiseshell and matte black set and the black is truly universal enough, because my picky boyfriend claimed that as his own. My only critique is that when I wear them, there's a gentle glare on the lens. It's not dirty, maybe it's just the blue light filtering film that is causing this? After a few minutes, it's not noticeable and I feel fine using my computer or watching TV at night.

I'm happy to continue using these and hopefully see some signs of improvement (maybe the headaches go away unless they are caused by something else? Maybe my eyes don't feel strained at night? Maybe I won't be so wired at night but I'm a night owl.) It's an easy investment, they are cute and comfortable, and I got a cat toy out of it.",positive

330,Electronics,"Roku Voice Remote (Official) for Roku Players, Roku TVs and Roku Audio",$19.88,5,"1) Layout is Good

So first of all this is a real Roku remote that's a perfect replacement for the remote that came with my TCL Roku TV. All the buttons are in the same place with two exceptions: The voice search button is added in between the back arrow and star button and the the preset buttons were arranged two rows of two instead of vertical. That said, this upgraded remote was made with a feel so similar to the original remote that I needed 0 time to become accustom to the new layout.

2) False Advertising Regarding Preset Buttons

So if you're like me, you see the blank preset buttons in the product photos, and think ""finally, I'm rid of useless presets and can set my own."" Nope! The four presets came loaded with Netflix, Parmount Plus, and two services that I don't have: Disney Plus and Apple TV. This what I hated most about the original remote which had a preset for Amazon Prime and Netflix, but also included Sling and CBS News (seriously it did) which I didn't have. Roku, let me choose presets when ordering the remote if I can't set them myself instead of sending me remotes with the presets apparently randomly chosen!

3) Pairing was Easy

I'm the type who reads the instructions, but they were short and simple. Go to the Roku home screen. Put the batteries in, and press the pairing button located in the battery compartment until the indicator light in the battery compartment flashes green. I didn't even get to pressing the pairing button. As soon as the batteries in, the indicator starting flashing, and the word ""pairing"" started flashing on my TCL Roku TV. Within seconds I had a second working Roku remote (and the other one continues to work too so I can use either now).

4) Voice search works

I was a little concerned that this feature wouldn't work well given the inexpensive price, but it does! I can request to open a particular Roku App like Amazon Prime or Youtube, but I am also able to use voice to navigate around inside of an App. So for example, 1) I was able to use the voice feature to go to Netflix, and then open a particular show inside of Netflix; and 2) I was able to use voice to go to Youtube, and then specifically request by voice to open my Watch Later list. Oh... and you can search out a particular show from the home menu with voice so you can simply say ""House of the Dragon"" and it will pull up options to watch it.

Overall:

I was disappointed by the presets were pre-populated, but at least Roku didn't stick CBS News on one of them this time. I was surprised at how well the voice function works as it makes finding programs so much easier. Overall, this is worth the relatively inexpensive price to upgrade your Roku experience, and I really wish I had seen a mention sooner that Roku voice remotes existed.",positive

Chromecast unit for a couple years on my 32in Scepter. Then I bougt a fancy new 50in 4k set, same brand (they do great picture quality for the price) not-smart set. Then I noticed that the chromecast unit was 1080p. Bothered me after a while, so on Prime Day, I broke down and bought the upgrade. (For some reason, Google Home had to call it ""Attic TV"", giving me no choice on the naming. I was concerned about Google TV, but it turns out that it is really easy to use, and gave me an opportunity to access more streaming services than the ones I pay for. Pluto and Tubi are free and have some good programming. And annoying commercials. But they're there with one click of the remote. As are all my other subscriptions. I use the remote, and not my phone. There's big buttons for Youtube and Netflix. Netflux is wasted space for me, but the onscreen interface is excellent. Picture and sound quality is excellent. I haven't hooked up the voice interface, so maybe Google isn't listening to me yelling at the dogs. One thing I like, it seems the unit shuts off after not being used. The old unit was always on. Access that source, and you always got the screen saver. But, for some reason, the clock on the screensaver is 2 hours off, and I can't find any way to change it, either onscreen settings or Google Home app. So, yes. I recommend this product. I'm glad I bought it. Casts pictures and videos from my phone no problem, too. And, apparently, there are no streaming services it will not access. You do your browsing snd searching on the big screen, instead of on the phone snd then cast your choice. (I have a horror story from trying a cheap knockoff. I refused to send that one back, and got them to refund my money anyway. It was made to collect informaion, and your watching tv was secondary. (More than Google? That's a question.) I did have to input my passwords to this interface. But they make that easy, too. Been finding I have to reboot the unit about weekly. Suddenly, it will just stop connecting to the services. Home page looks normal. No warning or instructions. So I have to keep the plug easy to reach. You only get 5 minutes on ""pause"" before the unit disconnects. Then it disconnects. Usually just takes one click to resume, but sometimes you have to sign back in to the server. That can be a pain. But it's a small thing, overall.",positive

Well, the Firestick I've had for many years bit the dust and it turns out to be a good thing.

I had thought to upgrade to the latest Firestick, but saw that Amazon was foisting ads on its users and I wanted no part of that. After looking at the options, I decided to go with Chromecast TV, which is a major upgrade from the first-generation units and I'm impressed!

The features that matter to me:
- It just works the way I'd expect, and everything is where it should be (for me)
- It allows me to cast from my Android devices very easily.
- I can also send apps from my Android phone to the stick if it's not in the default library. For me, that was necessary for Emby, streaming stream system for my movie library. So far, that's worked well, too.
- TV controls work nicely, even on the old 19"" Sharp TV.
- The remote buttons are uncluttered, organized nicely, and labeled well. They skipped adding extra buttons for the major services, which is a bonus. I wish I could reprogram the services buttons as I'd change YouTube for something else.
- While the price is higher than some alternatives, it's not out of reach and worth it in usability.

There is one and only one downside - They got ""artsy"" with the remote and made it small, slippery, and curved! That's really the only bad thing I have to say about it.

I like it so much that I'm finally looking to cut the cord and ditch cable.

Also, even when it launched it was a low powered device, they should really release an updated version with better performance, higher storage and that works with higher internet speed.

350,Electronics,"Fire TV Stick Lite with Alexa Voice Remote Lite (no TV controls), HD streaming device",$19.99,4,"I have several Fire Sticks, Roku TVs, and a Roku Express. I don't have a need for 4K so that feature, found on the more expensive models, is not important to me. Price and basic performance are what counts. The new FireTV Stick Lite delivers--especially at the current promotional price.

All three of my basic Fire Sticks are standard models and identical in appearance with slightly different remote controls. The oldest standard stick has the most basic features and no volume or power button. The newer standard model has the same controls but with the addition of a power button, mute button and volume controls. The newest Lite model removes the power and sound buttons, but adds a guide button, not on the other two.

They removed the power and sound buttons on the Lite model. With these buttons, I pretty much don't have to use the TV remote control at all. For a few dollars more, you may want to consider the basic FireTV stick, just to get the power and sound buttons. Just make sure that you are getting a newer model with these features, and not the original stick without these buttons.

UPDATE 12/13/2020: I discovered that you CAN control the TV Power ON/OFF with the Fire Stick Lite if your TV is CEC capable (most are.) Pressing the HOME button on the Fire remote should turn the TV on and switch to the Fire input. If the TV is already on, pressing the HOME button will switch to the correct input. To turn the TV off, press the MIC button and say ""TV POWER OFF"" and it should turn the TV off. Make sure that your TV HDMI settings have CEC control turned on for this hidden feature to work. So far, I haven't been able to control the volume this way.

All of the remote controls use RF (radio frequencies) to control the stick, rather than the usual infra-red (IR) controls found on TV remotes. That means that they don't have to be pointed at the TV to work. In fact, they wouldn't work with the Fire Sticks if they were IR remotes since the Stick sits behind the TV. The downside to the RF remote is that they are specific to the individual stick. The menu allows you to pair a new remote to the Fire Stick if you replace one. You can also access the Fire Stick with your cell phone with the FireTV app. This has come in handy when I've misplaced the remote control, or worn down the battery and not had a replacement. By comparison, the Roku Express (and my Roku TVs) use IR remotes that you have to point. They are interchangeable, and the batteries seem to last longer than the RF remotes used with the Sticks.

Performance, picture quality and speed are good on all three Fire Stick models. The Lite model is the newest of the basic models and should have the fastest speed, but I haven't detected any difference. To save on network bandwidth, I force all of my devices to operate at 720P. The picture quality is quite good on my TVs (up to 50"") and pushing higher resolutions just wastes bandwidth, in my opinion. However, picture quality is heavily dependent on the particular app and type of content being watched, so I can't really make any predictions how it will work for you.

The FireTV Sticks plug directly into the HDMI connector on your TV. A short extension cable is provided if there is not enough space for the Stick to be plugged directly in. The unit is provided with a 5V 1.0 amp AC adapter and a short USB cable. Amazon recommends plugging the stick in to a separate outlet, rather than using the USB jack on many TVs. In fact, if the unit detects that the TV USB connector doesn't have enough amperage, you'll get a message telling you not to use it. It's more convenient to use the TV to power the Stick but there are drawbacks aside from the lack of power. The TV often turns off the USB connector when powered down, meaning that when you turn on the TV, the Fire Stick will have to reboot and reconnect to your network, slowing down your start-up. It would also be possible, in rare instances, to accidentally power down your stick with the TV when an upgrade is being performed, which could cause problems. All that said, I still use the Fire Stick with a smaller 24"" Vizio that I carry out to the patio, and power it with the TV's USB connector.

All of the FireTV Sticks have the ability to talk to Alexa by pressing the microphone button. Because they are directly linked to the FireTV stick, you can also tell it to search for and pull up apps. Before using the FireTV products, I was accustomed to selecting a search box and keying in what I was looking for. With the FireTV Sticks, I can press the mic button and say what app I'm looking for and install it. Or, I can tell it what program I am looking for and it may search and find it on YouTube, then start playing it. Neat feature and habit forming. The voice remote has many other features, like being able to answer my Ring doorbells, view my CloudCams, and other Alexa related skills. However, for most Alexa related activities, I usually have an Echo in the same room and use that, rather than the Fire Stick.

How does the FireTV Stick Lite compare with the Roku Express? Because they are similarly priced, you'd expect them to be very similar, but they are actually quite different. I've always liked Roku's and the Express is a very fast and capable unit. It doesn't hang from the HDMI connector, but instead connects with a short cable and sits under or on top of the TV, positioned so the remote's IR beam can control it. The Roku Express seems to respond faster, and with some apps, performs much faster. Again, that could be and app thing, and not the performance of the unit. With CEC compatible TVs, the Express is able to turn the TV power on and off with the basic remote. One BIG difference (and one that's hard to find in the literature) is that the FireTV Stick works on Wi-Fi at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The Roku Express only works at 2.4GHz. If your network is heavily dependent on 5GHz, the Roku Express won't be a good choice. Fortunately, in my situation I am able to use both.

Finally, with any smart TV adapter, make sure that you get one that will run the program apps that you want. They are mostly the same on the Roku and Fire devices but there are differences. For example, on the FireTV Stick, I can view my Amazon Photo library, including videos that I've shot with my cel phone. I can't do that (at present) with the Roku. You may find that the Roku has apps that are not available on the FireTV products. Ultimately, it's the apps that make these things work.",positive

We found a fire stick for $11 on prime day and gave it a try. It is better than Roku in most respects. One advantage is that you can see a lot of your available shows in one place. You don't have to go in and out of the different apps to see what each has. If you are on the home page you will see things that are on your Netflix and your Hulu, etc, whatever you use.

This is actually better indexed than the apps themselves. There are movies missing in the apps, that if you search for them with Alexa you actually have them available to you for free. This is already happened a few times.

There are also a few decent games like Crossy Road. We're not sold on the idea of Alexa integration, or any AI, but we use the voice search all the time. So much easier than typing in every letter with a remote control. And as I mentioned above, Alexa has found movies that the individual streaming apps claimed they didn't have.

But I noticed something peculiar about the remotes. I made two separate orders and didn't pay attention that the listings were actually different. This listing with over 245,000 reviews gives you a remote WITHOUT shortcut buttons. There is no Hulu, Disney, Netflix or Prime buttons. If this matters to you, then you want to purchase from the listing that has about 16,000 reviews, it's close to 17,000 now. That listing has the newer remote.

380,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,4,"Due to my answer in the QA section receiving many endorsement, i decided to give it a bit more detailed review after 2 weeks into owning the Blink setup. I came from Simplisafe, and i still do have simplisafe's alarm system, but due to their lack of outdoor camera solution, i finally decided to pull the trigger on the latest Outdoor blink and try out the Mini blink as well.

First thing's first, the new Outdoor Blink cam works mostly as advertised but the indoor Blink Mini is junk. Read more about the Mini below. But first the Outdoor (good)

Blink Outdoor:
Motion recording speed & Delay:
The Outdoor cam's trigger time is almost instant, in fact, I noticed that it even records a second before entering the frame. which tells me that it might be doing some kind of constant recording into the cam's onboard volatile memory as cache, and once motion is triggered it starts encoding the data and dumps it onto the cloud. So the trigger time is almost instant. However, note that there is a 5 second delay from what's happening Live vs what you see on your phone. so that delay is between Trigger --> Encode --> Cloud --> Decode. I""d imagine that if your Cam is connected to a wifi bridge as oppose to directly to the main router, the delay could be longer than 5 seconds. Compare to Simplisafe cam, the Live vs View delay is about the same. and the trigger time is about the same too.

Motion sensor & sensor distance.
the motion sensor distance in the Outdoor cam is less than 25 ft. despite what the feature ad would tell you. i have 4 Cams (3 outdoor setup at an angle pointing down 45 degree angle, and 1 in the garage looking pretty much straight flat at my car), 3 of the outdoor ones could pretty much trigger 15~20ft out, while the one in the garage struggles to even trigger at 15 ft. You should also take night vision into account. in NV mode, the distance is 5ft shorter. increasing the IR blast in NV will somewhat mitigate the problem but at a cost of battery drain. i tried moving the cam in garage from pointing 45 degree down to looking almost straight horizontal to improve motion sensing to a degree. So if you have trouble with the motion sensor, try that. Compare to Simplisafe's cam, the Simplicam seems to have farther motion sensing distance. But then again, Simplisafe still doesn't have an outdoor solution.

Speaker/Mic
the speaker and Mic quality is really good. it doesn't sound overly tiny like you would expect and is loud and clear. compare to Simplicam, the Blink Outdoor has better sound and mic.

Wifi Wireless
i was surprised how well the wireless works. lots of complains in the review about wireless distance, not sure if they're genuine. but my farthest cam is about 80ft away from my main router thought a living room, a dining room and a garage and garage door (just shy of the max 100ft advertised in the spec), i am still able to get above 33% wifi N signal. But i think a lot of this ""might"" depend on the quality of your Wifi router. i spared no expense on my home wifi. So my router is 3x3 beam forming top of the line AC router that also has a very wide 802.11 N coverage. it can reach far and carry lots of bandwidth. my advice is invest in a quality wifi router with the most bandwidth and range you can afford. Note that the cams and module only supports 802.11 N. Compare to Simplicam, the wifi signal reach is about the same, if not slightly better than the Simplicam.

AC Wireless.
part of the charm and strength about the Blink Outdoor is its battery powered wireless nature. Only time will tell how long my Cams will last. I will update this review and reflect the score once my first set of battery run out. My gut tells me it'll be less than 2 years, well less. but i'd be happy if i can get even 1 year out of those cams. Note that the advertised 2 year battery life from Amazon is based on roughly 2 mins of video footage per day per cam. One of my busiest cam facing out the front door is seeing 2~3 times that amount.

Resolution/video quality
the resolution of the cam and video compression is really good. compare to those legacy 480p outdoor cams, this was a big step up. but compare to the simplicam, i would say the image looks slightly sharper than the Simplicam. but note that true 1080p resolution is only possible with high quality video record setting, which can chew up your battery and storage. Amazon's 2 year battery life is based on medium setting, which is actually 720p. but even at the medium setting, i still find the image to be very sharp and clear. going from medium to high (1080p) setting yield ""some"" improvement viewing on a smart phone. you likely won't be able to find big difference viewing it on a smartphone unless you view both videos on a large monitor. oh which btw, currently there's no app available for desktop computers. you'll have to either download the footage or pull the backup off your thumb drive to view it on a dekstop.

Storage
ok, this is the most contentious and messed up part. the ad made you believe that you don't need to subscribe to cloud and able to store locally. what they don't explain to you is that local storage is only a secondary option on top of the cloud subscription. so you CANNOT, at least at the point of this review, store your recordings directly to the USB thumb drive and read off of it directly. how the Blink cam works right now is everything gets dumped to their cloud server, and when you view the footage, it reads off their cloud server. the USB thumb drive is just there to backup ""from their cloud server"" ""once a day"". there is no way for you to have the cams upload recordings directly to the thumb drive locally and view them from your phone wirelessly off the USB Thumbdrive. There're a lot of people asking about this question on forums and, like me, only found this out after the fact. It's not a deal breaker, but it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Why not just come out and say it. It's simply misleading. if you go to their website, and dig, and i mean really dig, you'll find that there is a way to run it without subscription. but any motion trigger or live views will not be recorded. So what's the point of local storage? it's almost like they just want to find a way to cramp that ""local storage"" wording into their ad to sell you the product only to find out that it's a secondary backup on top of a pay subscription.

Now onto Blink mini (junk)

Blink mini on the other hand. To put it simply is junk or an opportunity wasted. the Blink Mini has a long standing bug that plagued the camera for at least 2 years, and the dev team still hasn't released a fix. The issue with Blink Mini is that it fails to trigger motion recording coming out of night vision mode when you enter the room to turn the lights on. the dev team explained that something to do with the cam goes into freeze mode when it attempts to wake itself out of night vision to do recording. for that reason, it's pretty much trash if you intend on using the Mini as any kind of indoor security cam. I originally intended to use the Mini in my garage to monitor my prized stallion. But i literately would go into my garage and walk up to the car and no motion or recording is triggered. Dev has acknowledged this issue since late 2018 and said in 2019 forum post that firmware update is coming to fix this. it is now end of 2020, i would not count on it. The only reason i kept my Mini and ordered another Outdoor cam for the garage is so that in any case when we go on vacation, i can set the Mini up in the living room to do live view. But if you're thinking about getting the Mini for motion triggered security cam indoor, forget it. don't say i didn't warn you.

Software UI/UX
the interface for the app is easy to use and more organized than many other similar services. clips are organized with usable filters at your disposal. the motion sensing manual dead zone configuration is helpful, although likely not too useful if you're using it outdoor, since the ""motion sensor"" distance (not wifi distance) is well shy of advertised 25ft.

OVERALL
the new Outdoor blink has a lot going for it. If they can fix their advertisement wording, or better, let us have the option to record directly to the USB Thumb drive and be able to view the recording from our devices directly from the thumbdrive. it'll then be a True local storage solution. the only reason i ditched my Simplicam is because i really wanted to have smart Cams covering my house outdoor. Been 3+ years since Simplisafe said that they would come out with an outdoor solution. But till this day, still nothing. i just got tired of waiting. When i saw the new Blink Outdoor being advertised for Black Friday, i really wanted to give it a try. i would say the barrier to entry is minimal. the Blink hardware given the discount that amazon has been giving out, is worth the shot. Without the deep discounts, i am not so sure. They just need to improve the motion sensor distance coverage, and let us really use the USB thumb drive for storage. In a sea of smart home security market today. Amazon really needs to do more to win over customers and not only that, to keep them there. If they can combine Ring with Blink, i might just ditch my Simplisafe completely and go Ring to combine their alarm system with Blink. If they can do that, i don't mind paying the $10/month subscription. But at its current state, they still have work to do to win over customers.

i will update the review on the battery life",positive
381,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,3,"Empecemos por decir que lo que ofrece el producto es lo que vas a obtener ni mas ni menos.

El producto es totalmente inalámbrico , lo que le da ventajas a la hora de una instalación limpia rápida y sin cables a simple vista.

La conexión vía remota desde el celular a través de app es genial y muy fluida, cuando quieres ver los videos, aunque la conexión con mi dispositivo echo show 5 a sido casi imposible para el control de voz y para la visión en vivo tiene un delay bastante desagradable.

La duración de las baterías es excelente tengo 5 camaras instaladas y una de ellas esta en la entrada del conjunto residencial, lo que hace que diariamente este por las 70 notificaciones de movimiento promedio con sus respectivos videos y aun después de un mes dice que esta sobre el 70% de vida.

Las notificaciones son casi que en tiempo real max unos 10 a 15 seg después de la detección de movimiento llega la notificación a la app de celular, pero la conexión con alexa en mi caso a sido terrible y bastante deprimente porque me decidí por el producto justo por esa función y no he podido darle solución a los errores constantes entre alexa y el skill de blink.

Ahora indaguemos mas en lo tecnico y por lo cual me ha decepcionado un poco el sistema.

Este no es un sistema de vigilancia de video es mas en mi opinión un sistema de alarma de movimiento con capacidad de grabar el evento que activo la señal de alarma, aunque muchas veces ese video termina por frustrarte mas y a continuación explico el porque

El sistema solo puede grabar entre 5 seg y 60 seg de grabación y aunque a veces 60seg es mucho tiempo, tiene una opción que permite parar el video antes si el movimiento se detiene, pero aca es donde comienza el problema en realidad, si activas esta opción, el sistema tiene una contra que la camara al desactivarse tarda 10 seg en volver a estar lista para registrar otra alerta lo cual hace que a veces pierdas información valiosa en cuanto a seguridad, si el movimiento para y luego se reactiva mientras la camara esta en el reposo de los 10seg, la camara no registrara nada en video y si el intruso sale fuera del rango de detección ya no podrás saber que paso luego, incluso si el movimiento llegar a seguir después de los 60seg max de grabación por alerta, la camara entraría en ese mismo tiempo de descanso de 10seg.

Aunque las alertas en la app son muy rápidas este Tiempo se puede ver afectado si la opción de alertas rápidas no esta activada, ya que esta viene desactivada por defecto y si no se activa en cada camara puedes tener unas que te avisen y otras que las notificaciones llegue siempre tarde o después que ya se detecto el movimiento.

En resumen si lo que quieres es un sistema de alerta de movimiento o cercanía este es el sistema que debería comprar pero si quieres un sistema de vigilancia de video busca otras opciones.

Dentro de amazon hay varias opciones de camara ptz wifi con grabación continua, detección de movimiento, alarma sonora y audio doble vía que trabaja muy similar a este sistema y con una memoria de 32gb tienes hasta 4 dias de grabación continua y son mas económicos, aunque no son tan excelentes como este en visión de video en vivo o revisando archivos de alarma te serán mas útiles si lo que buscas es un sistema cctv, por lo menos en mi opinión.

Postdata aun no se como funciona el sistema sin la membresía a Blink plus aun estoy dentro de la prueba gratis y aunque ya tengo todo el sistema para grabación local pronto volveré con mi opinión de como se porta el sistema una ves no tengas el soporte de Blink Plus.

--------------------------------------------------------

Let's start by saying that what the product offers is what you are going to get, no more, no less.

The product is completely wireless, giving you the advantage of a quick clean installation without wires at a glance.

The remote connection from the cell phone through the app is great and very fluid, when you want to watch the videos, although the connection with my echo show 5 device has been almost impossible for voice control and for live viewing it has a delay quite unpleasant.

The duration of the batteries is excellent, I have 5 cameras installed and one of them is at the entrance of the residential complex, which means that every day there are 70 average movement notifications with their respective videos and even after a month it says that it is over 70% life batteries.

Notifications are almost in real time, max about 10 to 15 seconds after motion detection, the notification arrives on the mobile app, but the connection with alexa in my case has been terrible and quite depressing because I decided on the right product for that function and I have not been able to solve the constant errors between alexa and the blink skill.

Now let's dig deeper into the technical and for which the system has disappointed me a bit.

This is not a video surveillance system, it is more in my opinion a motion alarm system with the ability to record the event that activated the alarm signal, although many times that video ends up frustrating you more and I will explain why below.

The system can only record between 5sec and 60sec of recording and although sometimes 60sec is a long time, it has an option that allows you to stop the video earlier if the movement stops, but this is where the problem really starts, if you activate this option, the system has a counter that when the camera is deactivated, it takes 10 seconds to be ready again to record another alert, which sometimes means that you lose valuable information regarding security, if the movement stops and then reactivates while the camera is At rest for 10 seconds, the camera will not record anything on video and if the intruder goes out of the detection range, you will no longer be able to know what happened next, even if the movement continues after the maximum 60 seconds of recording by alert, the camera would enter that same rest time of 10sec.

Although the alerts in the app are very fast, this Time can be affected if the quick alerts option is not activated, since it is deactivated by default and if it is not activated in each camera you can have some that notify you and others that Notifications always arrive late or after motion has already been detected.

No me In short, if what you want is a movement or proximity alert system, this is the system you should buy, but if you want a video surveillance system, look for other options.

Within amazon there are several wifi ptz camera options with continuous recording, motion detection, sound alarm and two-way audio and lights that works very similar to this system and with a 32gb memory you have up to 4 days of continuous recording and they are cheaper, although They are not as excellent as this one in viewing live video or reviewing alarm files. They will be more useful if you are looking for a cctv system, at least in my opinion. Postscript I still don't know how the system works without Blink plus membership I'm still in the free trial and although I already have the entire system for local recording I'll soon come back with my opinion on how the system behaves once you don't have Blink support Plus.",fair

We recently lost our internet connection due to updates our ISP had to make. What we didn't know is that Blink cameras are solely dependent on an Internet connection (not just a wifi connection) even if you don't have a subscription or just have the trial. None of the outdoor cameras will remain active when you lose Internet connectivity. My wrongful assumption was that ONLY your local area network was needed since it relies on a wifi signal. Nope. That is wrong. The Sync Modules will flash the green LED and no camera will work. Great job Blink/Amazon for putting customers at risk to thieves and other criminals.

We have 4 of the outdoor cameras on two separate Sync2 Modules due to the distance from the main router. We have an extender (set as a repeater) which handles the furthest cameras. As I said I never considered these would go offline if the Internet connection went down. I figured if my LAN went down then it would make total sense the cameras would go offline, yet I was foolish in my thinking.

Again this is shameful of Blink/Amazon to have this even as a feature. I get that you need an account to pay for the service, but why in the world would these be designed to FAIL if your Internet connection goes down?

It is not only misleading to consumers to not EXPLICITLY state that these cameras will fail to operate without an Internet connection.

This IS one of the WORST investments my family ever made in a product. Would have been better to purchase a CCTV camera system and just hardwired everything on the network. For what we've now paid for 4 cameras + the sales tax we could have gotten a 4 camera CCTV setup instead from a local box store.

As I have said in my original review, the cameras do work, and will suffice. Keep in mind that an Internet connection is REQUIRED and not just your local area network connection. I had to lower my rating to just one star because nothing is lower than that on Amazon's site. I'd give this camera system negative stars it it were possible just based on our experience over the past few months.

Also I think I was far too generous with parts of my original review, but experience will change your mind when the experience becomes bad.

I no will longer recommend ANY of the Blink cameras. Until they are no longer dependent on an Internet connection and will fully function on just your local networks wifi signal. I will be researching a true CCTV camera system to replace the Blink cameras. If I could get a refund I'd do it in a heartbeat, but that window has closed. The price of this education is high!

---------
Original review

Recently purchased the Blink Outdoor 2 Camera system, and it's a very hit or miss system. I have several things to say about the security cameras and the Blink app that goes with it.

The base:

The friction fit mounting bases are not easy to snap into place. I had to use a long and think flat headed screw driver to aid in connecting it. Also I worried about crushing the sensor on the camera because of how much force it takes and where my hands are pressing on the camera itself (holding from the edges while mounting under a roof eave is moderately annoying). Once it is finally snapped to the base it moves freely and the camera stays in place.

The Sync 2 Module

This is the brains of the system. Each module controls up to 10 cameras and utilizes your 2.4GHz Wifi connection. Now I mistakenly assumed that my 2 camera system didn't include the Sync 2 Module (I didn't notices a ""what's in the box"" on Blinks Amazon page. So I ended up buying one which was a waste of money considering it's included. The setup takes a while after you power it on you'll need the app to discover the device. Initially the blue LED flashes and the green LED is steady. Once it is discovered then then both LEDs are steady.

The app (Android)

At first the app to control this camera system seems simple, but there are some annoyances I've discovered. The system will NOT discover the best WiFi connection on your network. I have an detached garage with the camera approximately 75 feet from the Sync 2 Module, and my router is close to 10 feet from the Sync 2 Module. So I picked up a WiFi extender and set it as a Repeater (firewall, DNS, DHCP etc. is controlled by my primary router) in order for the signal strength to be at a maximum. It is recommended that you use the existing WiFi names (SSIDs) on your network (for 2.4GHz only) and append _EXT so Blink can see it if using a Wifi extender. Also keep your password keys for your wifi extender the exact same that are on your main wifi router. Now in theory (and based on Blink's own guidelines) the system should pick the best Wifi signal based on your setup. Well it doesn't, and there is NO option in the Blink app for me to place my garage camera on the extender Wifi (again it's on the same network as all my devices are) while keeping the door camera on the primary router (same network once again). This is not about changing networks, this is about discovering the extender on my main network (which I repeat Blink claims it will chose the best signal automatically). Yes I could add the second Sync 2 Module in the garage, but then I'd have to create a second system for the garage camera. Not entirely what you should have to do.

Batteries: These cameras require the more expensive Lithium AAs you do get the batteries with the cameras (mine were Energizer Lithium AAs. The cameras are equipped with a USB B mini connection which you can use to connect to a powered USB source as to not run off batteries. In my case I picked up a motion detector LED flood light that offers a USB connection (this unit https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08F9CNPVW). I would remove the batteries from the cameras because I do not know if connected will it try to charge the batteries (these are NON chargeable lithium batteries) or it will it bypass the batteries? I would err on the side of caution and remove them.

Local Storage (USB thumb drive) vs Blink Subscriptions

This is an Amazon product and you'd think that the Blink camera systems would provide free service to Amazon Prime members. Nope. You are nickled and dimed on a per camera basis at $6 monthly, and it's $100 annually (if I read it right) for one full system). Again why is this NOT part of Prime Membership?

So to avoid saving to the cloud I bought a 256GB thumb drive to insert into the Sync 2 Module. What I have discovered is ONLY clips are saved locally. You are NOT able to save live recordings to the local storage. Really? Why? What's the point of only having the clips (maxed at 60 seconds) on a local drive? To me this is a rip off and not mentioned anywhere in the product details.

Yes you do get a ""free"" trial which unlocks all features. If you; however, cancel that trial early or let it expire without buying a subscription than certain features are locked. So again you pay a lot for the camera system and you are locked out of many features IF you don't buy their subscription to the cloud. Talk about ripping folks off. Sure you can look at live feeds, but you can't same them locally. You can take a snapshot from the cameras, but it will NOT take a photo every hour UNLESS you BUY a Blink subscription. Again this all goes back to Blink subscriptions. Tell me what's the point of local storage if all you can save are clips?

Loading issues with clips and thumbnails. So I've run into issues where loading a clip from the connected USB drive fails to load 95% of the time. Again these are short clips and should pull faster than from the Cloud. Nope. Thumbnails are hit or miss. These are generated when you press the camera icon on the home screen of the app. I call them snaps, but I've noticed if I am sitting near the Sync 2 Module it can still fail. Full wifi bars too and it still fails.

Alexa:

It is claimed by Blink that the newest generation of their cameras will work with Alexa. I used the app from my phone, but she can't do anything with the cameras (even when trained to use them). In this case you may have to buy an Alexa enabled device (like Show). You technically don't need one they are NOT required for these cameras, but the Alexa app alone on a smartphone is limited.

Finally the recommend having minimum Internet speeds of 2Mb up and down for these cameras, but I believe that is ONLY if you are saving and storing to the cloud along with accessing from the cloud. Locally your access to the Blink cameras will depend on your network speeds along with wifi. The more stuff you have connected the slower it can be.

Conclusion. The Blink Camera System isn't terrible, and they are affordable. There are quirks as I mentioned and annoyances I have dealt with. These are not high end systems but on a tight budget you can get a good start.",negative
383,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,1," FINAL UPDATE: What was once pretty cool and recommended is now completely useless. If you don't subscribe they take away features and the entire system no longer works right.. They want you to pay every month.. $10/month that's $120 a year.. They also want you to link your Amazon account. Make sure to read the fine print.. Blink wants your Amazon data.. I've spent over $2,000 on these cameras.. Now all of it is useless.. Short clips blurred images glitches all the time deleted clips reappear sometimes it doesn't even record no live view saves, sensors don't pick up anything audio goes out, it all turned to trash. They want to blame it on your wifi. 🙄 They are throttling controlling how well your cameras work.. I feel so betrayed and swindled. I've been recommending these cameras even set my parents up told friends now it's all a waste because Blink wants to be shady.. VERY DISAPPOINTING DO NOT REWARD COMPANIES LIKE THIS WITH YOUR MONEY. 👎🤨

UPDATE: 4/28/21 - 8 or so months in. I have purchased 17 of these cameras and 3 sync modules and planned on buying more also purchased many accessories. Different mounting brackets for the cameras and modules wifi extenders larger battery packs etc. They all worked great at first then slowly came the problems. I put up with the failed views the super short recordings that happened now n then the modules going offline repeatedly no its not my internet the glitches etc ... Now something about a PLUS PLAN suddenly pops up on my app. You can no longer save live clips. 😡 One of the cool things was being able to watch something live then being able to save it. You cannot do that simple little thing anymore.

The cloud storage wasn't that big of a deal since you could pop in a thumbdrive to save recordings. Now they want to charge you for the ability to save live views onto your thumbdrive. It was cool and convenient the ability to view something live catch something happening which is the whole point of a camera then saving it. Now if you catch something happening live its useless because you can't save it. 😡 The system has to be armed and you have to hope the sensors pick it up and even then it may not even reset. They ruined the playback on the app now. No thumbnails and if you want to delete you have to delete clips separately no select all option. This is NOT WORTH BUYING anymore. For the amount of money I spent I should be able to save a short live view. I could have purchased a nicer security system for the money I spent. I no longer recommend this system as they want to charge you a monthly fee for a simple feature a doorbell cam can do. At bare minimum they should not charge Prime Members a subscription fee. Very disappointing that they change the functionality so they can charge you for it. My original review and updates are below.
👇😕

This is pretty close to a must have they just need to make some tweaks. 🤙 Picture quality is pretty good. It has a nice dynamic range. The POV is pretty good. Its plenty wide and a little fisheye. For the most part pretty clear. 👍

The audio is fairly decent but you get a lot of humming and hissing. The microphone where you can talk to someone is fairly decent. You're talking about close distance about average distance of someone at your front door.

The setup is pretty easy just install the app and follow the instructions. Let it update the firmware. One tip when you get to the cameras leave the back off because you will have to scan the QR code.

So why not 5 stars since this is pretty cool? The back where you put the batteries screws on and off with a wonky tool they give you. It would be fine if it was a twist lock not an actual screw. The price is kinda steep. I needed 4 cameras. 4 sides to a house or building right? They don't have a 4 camera bundle. 3 or jump to 5. I purchased another single camera because it was only $10 more with a sync module than a add on camera.

Not much security for the camera itself. It just pops off. Anyone can steal it. The camera mount has a limited angle. Its basically made for a straight flat install. I bought separate swivel mounts so I can mount it to the underside of my roof on the side of my house and place the camera looking down the side of my house. They should upgrade the mount. You can always mount the camera higher to avoid theft but sometimes that's limited.

After awhile there's inconsistencies short clip recordings failed views no restart recordings after the pause and the longest you can record is 30 seconds and it won't fully record the full 30 secs. Audio cuts out or doesn't record at all and lots of freezes. 😐

This is a pretty good simple to set up and use camera system. The night vision and motion detection are pretty decent. They should have kept the free cloud storage but i prefer the separate thumbdrive storage. Less chances of hacking being all over the interweb. Using a thumbdrive is not a problem. Maybe they should include one. There's a slight delay in the live shot. Hear something and you wanna click live view you wait a few seconds and by that time the action is gone. They need to make that faster. As for getting notifications instantly when the motion detection is triggered its not bad but there's a delay there too. And it does not recognize or connect to my 5G only to 2.4G on my wifi. 😐 Like I said its pretty decent but could use some improvements and am sure they will continue to do so but for now for what I'm using it for as simple security and being able to monitor my house and yes I can be away and monitor my house from afar yeah definitely worth getting. 👍

UPDATE: Its been a month and a half and the batteries are still good. I do notice not as much hissing and screeching noise. Don't know if that means battery life is going down and the mic is less powered or what but everything still works pretty good. Picked up several of the mini cams as well on sale. Great for inside and the garage. Had one on the patio but it got a little moisture slime. Didn't affect the camera though but I did move it in.

Had one hick up. It said view failed or something like that once and I couldn't get a live view. I just took a photo and it seemed to clear that up. I see a lot of people showing that in the reviews so thought that would help.

I also see a lot of reviews posting pics of bad night vision. You need to reposition your camera. You either have something below it or above it too close to the lens. For example if you have it mounted under an awning and you get a dark picture or you get a foggy looking halo ring you need to bring the camera out further so there is not much covering the top or bottom. The sides are also affected but not as much.

Move it around remember camera position is key for good night vision. Even though it's made for the outdoors you don't want it in direct sunlight where the unit will go passed the 110deg limit. That will kill battery performance and camera capabilities. Hope that helps some of you with those issues. I will update again on battery life. So far its near Thanksgiving and batteries are good. I arm it at night 100% of the time. During the day a little less. I've captured several delivery personnel a raccoon a couple of cats sun glare off my pool some dust looking particles that look like spirits flying away 😄 and of course myself when I forget to disarm 😃 and the battery indicator says OK. They really need a percentage indicator on that. I live view several times a day but only for a few seconds if there's nothing going on.

The cloud thing is not a big deal at all. Get a thumbdrive and you're good to go. All your clips are saved on that instead of the cloud. I love the easy sharing too. I will text my friends with a short clip I can upload straight to my YouTube channel. Its pretty cool. One thing I would like to see is a shorter break between clips. You can miss a lot in 10 seconds. And a longer recording capability than 30sec especially with motion. I know that can eat battery life but they can improve there as well.🖖😉👍

UPDATE 2: I'm getting more failed to connect to cloud indications and I'm not using the cloud I'm using a thumbdrive. I'm also getting more false recordings. Nothing is happening and it will record a clip. Also a live view will pop up in the recorded clip segment. 🤔 Its starting to be a little fidgety but not to the point it upsets me.

UPDATE 3: One of the cameras needed a reset. Pop the batteries out then pop em back in. 🤔 It said failed view or not available something like that. Battery life is going on 3 months with moderate use. What's moderate use? I arm every night and 3 - 5 times a day. Take photos 2 - 3 times and watch live view 4 - 5 times a day. Each live view is for one cycle before it times out or asks to continue. Sometimes I'll watch live view for 3 - 4 times continued. Still haven't needed to replace batteries yet. 👍

Update 4: Colder weather is here and another camera needed a reset where you pop the batteries out wait 30secs and pop em back in. Battery still says ok and its going on 3 and a 1/2 months. It first gave me a failed to load warning here n there and that may be a sign you may need to do a reset.

Update 5: The inconsistencies have increased greatly. The syn module continually goes offline requiring a wifi reboot. The batteries are still good and it's been 6 months. There are more freezes and jumps in recordings.",negative
384,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,4,"I must preface this review by telling all that I am a mechanical klutz but semi-tech savvy. I should also advise that I only received and assembled this product a few hours ago so I will certainly learn more as time passes and I will amend this review accordingly. Having said that, there are a few things that I should mention for the benefit of all other klutz's out there. The first thing I noticed is that there are no detailed instructions! Everyone noted in Amazon revewes how easy installation was so I wasn't all that concerned when placing my order. I should have been. Inexcusable that there were no instructions. I resorted to going to You Tube and found a couple of videos that were very helpful. But even with the videos, I had some very simple but troubling issues. I am after all a klutz.

The first step in installation is to download the Blink app. Much to my surprise, the free Blink app is not compatible with a desktop PC Windows computer. It is primarily an Android app so I was compelled to download the app to my Android phone. Now I realize that most would not have an issue doing that but I wish I had known that because I prefer to control my surveillance systems on my PC. I suspect there may be 3rd party companies that offer Blink compatible software for PC's but again, I wish I had known beforehand. I am still investigating and will likely find a solution to use the app on my PC but for now, can only use compatible devices.

The cameras and the module are all wrapped in a thin and almost invisible plastic wrap. One of the first steps is to install the provided 2 Lithium AA batteries in the rear of each of the cameras. I finally figured out how to get the back plate/cover off the camera and it was a little frustrating. First, you should know that there is a rubber plug that covers the screw which holds the back plate. You need to take that plug out to access the screw. The kit provided a plastic key that fits into the screw and can be used to unscrew the screw. Simple right? Well, I turned and turned and turned the screw but the back plate would not come off. I finally figured out that there was a very thin and invisible plastic that wrapped around the edges of the camera body and that it had to be removed because it otherwise prevented the back plate from releasing once it was unscrewed. Yes, you have to have had eagle eyes to have seen that plastic film and it was a little tricky getting it off. (I warned you that I was a klutz.) Ok, so now that I removed the plastic, I found a notch in the back plate to help lift it out of the camera body. That now revealed the slots where to install the batteries and the slots were adequately marked to show polarity positions. But after you install the batteries - do not screw the cover back on. Why? Because you need to access the camera ID serial numbers. Again, I had to find this out on my own because there were no instructions! Also know that once you do screw the back plate back on, it should be orientated properly and there is only one way that will happen even though the cover will go on any way. The easiest way to orient the plate correctly is to ensure that the USB C port opening lines up with the USB C port on the camera.

Synching the module and each of the cameras was relatively easy so I won't belabor these steps. The You Tube videos were very helpful to get through these steps. But here's another setup klutz problem I came across. To mount the cameras, there are mounting bases that attach to the back of the camera body by snapping into that area where the screw is located. Sounds easy enough but it is a little tricky. First, understand that the mounts need to be screwed into whatever house structure your attaching the camera to. But the holes in the mount are situated in such a manner that it is impossible to access the holes once the camera is attached. So you need to first screw the mount on to the wall before attaching the camera. The only problem with that is you now have to snap the camera on to the mount and as I mentioned above, that was a little difficult.

OK, now that I had the cameras set up, figuring out how to work the system was another stumbling block. Again - no guidance because no instructions. Even being a little tech savvy, I had some difficulty. I found that the software was not as user friendly as I would have expected. OK, I am still playing with the system and learning but once again, it sure would help having instructions.",positive
385,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,5,"When we first purchased cams back in 2017, we compared to Arlo and Ring before we chose Blink. Now we are up to 10 cams, covering every angle of the house. Here are my findings after using them for almost 4 years (and still buying more):
PROS:
> #1 video quality is excellent. Day time is a bit better than night, but night vision is as good as it gets with cams. POSITION of your cam matters a ton. I started out putting them way high up and quickly realized - if you actually want identifying features - they need to be lower. Otherwise... yeah you see someone walking past, but you cant ID anything, so what is the use.
> So inexpensive - so easy to integrate. Anytime we have ANYTHING we need to cover, we just order another cam and it literally takes 5 minutes to get it out of the box, batteries in, and added to existing system.. seriously - 5 minutes.
> The app is great. Very intuitive. Our first cams had very few ""advanced features"" every time i order new cams, they have improved their features. Now you are able to zoom all the way in to very small areas, to capture certain areas and exclude others.. For example - old cams you had to block off large sections of the capture area to avoid the cams picking up movement from trees, but now you can pinpoint one little part of a branch on a tree to exclude if its triggering the cam.
> Motion detection is very sensitive - but they have it tweaked just about right. It never misses anything, but if you setup your exclusion zones well - you can get it almost perfect. I dont have a lot of false alarms and I'm running 10 cams. We have one setup to look at the sidewak, and after much tweaking, we can actually exclude the street... but pick up both sidewalks on both sides of the street. You can setup the app to alert you or not alert you.. you can turn sound on or off on alerts. On windy days I do end up just going into the app and turning off all cams that are setup around lots of trees until the storm is over.. but thats like a few times a year.
> Super easy playback and control of cams. It's instant - you can control them in any way, very easily. If I am working on a project in the yard, I dont want my cams on for hours, running out of batteries - so I just go into the app and turn them all off. It takes seconds. Likewise - if i hear a noise at night, super easy to open the app and live view any cam so i can look all around the house and see everything happening outside, from every angle.
> Extremely easy to move around. We have had them for years - so we move them around occasionally. I even had mice in our crawlspace under the house at one point and just grabbed one of the cams off the side of the house and stuck it down there so I could catch them at night. Theres no commitment with these - no hard wiring so you can mount them anywhere and taking them on and off the mount takes 2 seconds.
> No subscription needed to store clips. thats BIG for us. We would not like blink as much if they changed that. We run a lot of cams and it just stays 100% full storage - we can still access a few weeks worth of video, it just deletes oldest. You can download/save any videos.
> Lots of mounting options. You have to buy them separately if you want anything special, but I have 3 different types of mounts - one for trees, one around porches that need to be secured so they cant be taken, and then the standard mounts for cams not at risk of being taken. There are camo skins as well - I have on in a tree that you pretty much cant see unless you know its there.
> Customer support is super decent. In the winter of 2018, one of my cams took on a green hue to the image when the temp went down to about 10 degrees outside. I emailed customer service explaining the issue and sent a screenshot and within 24 hours they asked me for the SN of the cam, and did a firmware update that fixed it. I was quite happy with that.
CONS:
> So while the batteries are awesome because the cams are so easy to move around and deal with... i blow through batteries. Fortunately, i just get 20 packs of AA's, but with 10 cams - even though Blink ~says~ batteries can last a year? it totally depends on usage. So we get LOTS of traffic on our front cams because we live in a busy area and have people walking past all day. I change out the batteries on every one of those front cams once a month. Granted - thats many hundreds of video captures and ideally, we should connect those cams to electricity somehow - that is an option with blink, but I dont mind changing batteries. On the cams in the back yard and side paths - I really can go once or twice a year changing those, except for the ones that catch a lot of foot traffic. So the battery usage is totally dependent on traffic. Personally - the cams are a big deal to me, so i dont mind it at all. Benefits totally outweigh the downsides.
> The biggest difference between Blink and some other companies is that i see other people with hardwired cams that can catch EVERYTHING in a continuous fashion, for hours. like the surveillance videos you see online where the cam just happened to catch something happening down the street...Blink doesnt work that way. it only captures immediate video clips, triggered by motion activation. It does store all videos.. you can see something weird in your yard and look back through videos to find out what happened - but it isnt 24 hours of continuous video feed.
> You can get gaps in your videos. So it can capture 1 minute of video at a time, but then it takes a small break before it starts capturing again, so if something is happening and its videotaping an event - it will record an entire minute of excellent footage - but then it takes a 5 second break before it starts recording again. that doesnt sound like a long time, and for security it's not normally an issue.. the average bad guy is in and out quickly.. but it is annoying that it takes 5 seconds to re-trigger. So.... 2 minutes of continuous video... but in the middle of that 2 minutes.. a 5 second break.
OVERALL - Super high video quality... cams you can move around super easily... a very easy app... I love blink and the upsides far outweigh any downsides. I always recommend it to people when they ask. You can cover your entire house at a super affordable price, you dont need to be rich at all.. Our 3 year old cams are still as good as our brand new ones. The peace of mind the cams bring me is priceless. I know every single thing happening everywhere, all the time outside. The affordability made it possible so that nothing can ever surprise us.",positive
386,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,5," We've got some bad actors in the hood, so it was time to catch them with some irrefutable evidence. Our XT2 is a little old and our Arlos are acting stupid. Saw this come out and had to give it a shot. It was time to upgrade. Plus, the specs of the possibility of TWO YEAR BATTERY LIFE is mindblowing. It's probably a lot less, but my Arlos would last a week with $10 CR123 batteries, so that had to go. Anything had to be better than those dinosaurs.

Set up was fairly easy. There is no real printed instruction manual, but those are rare today. Scanned the QR code and my smartphone popped me to their website with tons of tips, info, and even setup videos. The entire setup process is QR from the new Sync Module 2 to the camera itself. So don't make the mistake of slapping the batteries in and closing the camera unit like I did before I scanned the QR code. Whoops. Took less than 15 minutes to setup and sync. Signed up for a new Blink account so the old one won't get confused - plus there's several weeks of free cloud storage right now. Boom.

Set it up in a tree ACROSS from my house this time. When I put it over my door, my old cameras would flag every car or pedestrian close and far. All I want to see is the jerk stealing my UPS packages, so I flipped the perspective. The HD is super clean and clear, and the camera is at least 30 feet from the sync module with no problems connecting. Big plus there. And, there's a pretty powerful little speaker in this unit! I was really surprised at the volume this thing can push for such a small speaker. Now, when this alerts me to funny business, maybe I'll be able to yell at the perps. Probably not, because they'll be long gone by the time I see the notification. Still, this feature could be useful in warning your kids from doing something silly when you're not home.

The live view was disappointing, since you have to keep clicking the app to continue the live view for longer than 10-ish seconds. So you can't use this as a spying device or a baby monitor. Bummer. Also, the default recording time was like 5 seconds, probably to maximize battery life. You can't catch much in 5 seconds. I adjusted mine in the settings to about 20 seconds. I'll sacrifice battery life to catch a bad actor. Plus, there's a battery pack you can attach to this unit to increase battery life. I'll update in the future to let you know how the battery goes.

Overall, I'm impressed with the new Blink outdoor. It's gonna rain here in Florida soon, so I'll let you know how that goes as well as night shots when available.",positive
387,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,5,"I was fortunate to buy in early on the Blink camera system. Therefore, I have the included cloud coverage. Only recently did I find out just what an advantage that was.

After buying my initial system, I continued to add cameras to the initial sync module. I ultimately ended up having two additional sync modules from systems I purchased after the original system. I was under the impression that all my cameras had to be connected to the original sync module to continue receiving free cloud coverage.

I currently have a mixture of cameras to include 3-XT2, 4-Outdoor, 1-Indoor (2nd gen) and 2-Mini. I was using a schedule to arm the cameras, but I was disappointed that the system would not allow individual scheduling for each camera.

I recently decided to use my additional sync modules to divide my cameras into different zones and allow myself to set different schedules for each zone. Even if it meant the additional modules would not include free cloud coverage, I felt the scheduling control would be worth it.

I was happily surprised to find that even the newer modules set up under the original system included free cloud coverage. Therefore, I now have three different zones that can be individually scheduled. And furthermore, I can add up to 10 cameras to each module.

I only ran into one problem with the setup. The second module I had purchased had been sitting in the box for probably about a year. When I tried to add a camera to it, it would not connect. I called customer support and the first person wasn’t able to help me. I decided to investigate the problem myself and noticed there was a huge difference in the firmware on the second module.

I expected that the firmware of the second module would automatically update, and there was no way to initiate an update within the App. Since it didn’t automatically update, I called customer service back and told them the problem. The individual I spoke with didn’t seem to understand the issue, so I simply insisted that the module’s firmware had to be updated by them.

It took a number of increments to finally update the firmware once the issue had been escalated to the appropriately skilled technician. I insisted that the customer service representative stay on the line until the firmware of the second module exactly matched that of the existing module. I wasn’t trying to go through another 30 minute hold and 20 minute update again.

After the firmware was updated, I was able to add cameras to the second module. I will monitor the module to make sure future firmware updates occur.

I realize that the cloud coverage or camera support may change or discontinue in the future. But for the time being, I’m quite happy with my Blink system.",positive
388,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,3,"I've purchased a total of 4 Blink Outdoor + 3 Blink Mini cameras, plus a sync module and USB backup drive for the security system at my retail space. It's honestly probably the best and easiest way to get a security system installed without wires at a small business. Yes I have used Ring, and Canary. I prefer Blink. Since I’ve seen this now at brick and mortar retail locations, in addition to Amazon, I figure a review might help you make an informed purchase (spoiler, I love it).

This review really supports all of Blink’s camera products, as an ecosystem, though Amazon strangely would only let me review the standalone “Outdoor” camera. So you can infer details to the rest of Blink’s product lineup. You should know that Amazon purchased Blink in 2018, so I hope it gets some attention with new software features and hardware refresh.

Pros:
* Wireless. As long as you have reasonably good wifi, the cameras work. I use a mesh system to cover 6000+ sq ft of space, and all the cameras record and alert me.
* Battery. The outdoor cameras run on 2 AA lithium batteries. I don’t know how, but they last WAY longer than comparable rechargeable batteries for competing camera brands
* Price. Blink’s system is very price competitive. The mini cameras are downright cheap. The Outdoor cameras are competitive, considering how long the battery lasts, how small they are, how easy they are to install, and the superb reliability.
* Footage. Blink paid plan is cheap and stores a month of
* App. It’s simple and straightforward. Easy to view alert footage, and pull up recent footage. Wish it was easier to organize/review past footage… once you’re past a week it get tedious and hectic to find anything quickly and efficiently.
* Communication: You can speak into your phone with the app open and have a 2-way conversation with any party present at individual cameras. I’ve used this feature to communicate with staff, and also warn maleficent actors to leave the premises before I notify authorities.
* Sensitivity: You can customize a bunch of the toggles for camera recording, active area, sensitivity etc which is great. It’s not quite as intuitive as Ring or Canary which literally let you draw areas to avoid or record, but the toggles for the recording area as well as sensitivity triggers, recording length, quality, notification lights, etc are intuitive and great.

Cons:
* Multiple Locations: Currently Blink does not allow you to have multiple locations for your Blink system. This is a real bummer because I would easily buy this same system for my home, office, and to help keep an eye on my elderly parents at their house. Unfortunately you can’t. To do this you have to have a separate Blink account for each location, and manually log out and then log in to the location you want to pay attention to. That defeats the purpose of a security system, if you can’t receive timely notifications from all of your security cameras. If you have to manually review footage, it’s too late to help.
* User Access: Another big annoyance is you can’t selectively invite users to access your account with different access permissions. So currently I am the only person reviewing my Blink account. It would be a big help to delegate managers and other authorized administrators, especially in a multi-location environment where you want your family to have access to home security, your staff access to office security, but don’t want those groups to see the other cameras. I hope Blink implements robust user invitations and sharing access once Multiple Locations is supported.
* Geo-Fencing: There is no geolocated ability to arm, disarm, or set location-based trigger schedules for Blink. It’s either time, or manual arming or disarming. I also use a Canary system, and one of the big perks is the ability to have the system automatically switch gears if you or particular people come and go from a location. Wish I could do that for Blink, to have it automatically arm itself with the most sensitive settings when my staff leaves the location for the night.
* Auto-Delete: Once your USB drive is full, expect daily notifications that “local storage is full”. It asks you to delete footage to make room for more, which is pointless, because at the end of each day it will automatically do this (since the USB drive automatically clears old footage as needed, but still sends the annoying notification about storage being full).

Other:
* Neighbors App: Integrates with a community, I don’t use this much, but great feature to have especially for neighborhood safety.
* Amazon: You purchase your premium subscription through Amazon, and link your Amazon account to your Blink account.
* Alexa Integration: I use a series of Alexa devices with screens throughout the retail space to quickly look at cameras if I get an alert with my phone. Take a second to wake each camera (especially battery-operated Outdoor cams), and is very useful for safety and suspicious activity.
* Outdoor Mount: The outdoor cameras can be easily “popped” off their mount, if a maleficent person knows what’s up and decides to take a camera.
* Battery Life: The battery life of Blink Outdoor with 2 AA Lithium is good enough to not be a con. However the battery life is significantly less than “2 years” advertised. So far I’ve had to change the batteries on all four of my Outdoor cameras about every 3-4 months. Unfortunately there’s no alert or indicator to tell you if the battery is about to die. It’s either “OK” or the camera goes offline (with a slow blinking red light on the physical device).

VERDICT:

Blink is a great system, I totally recommend it as long as you only have one location and you are the sole user. The price is great, the performance is reliable with quality coverage, and it’s comparable, if not better than competitors.

If you need security systems at multiple residences or other locations, want to automate the system arming/triggers based on your geo-location, and need to invite and grant specific access to different people (friends vs staff) you should definitely avoid Blink and look to Canary or Ring for a security solution.

If the three major cons were address I would easily increase my rating from 3 to 5 stars. I hope Blink (and Amazon) is listening!",fair
389,Electronics,"Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit",$159.99,4,"I've only had these outdoor cameras for a few days, so I won't comment on battery life yet. But overall, I'm very happy with these cameras and most of their features. I'm nitpicking a bit here, which is why there are so many Cons. They are minor issues outweighed by the Pros.

PROS:
* Setup was relatively simple--once you understand it--but the instructions weren't (see below)
* Infrared is awesome in the darkest environments and does a good job switching between IR and non-IR automatically
* Motion detection works well, as does the 1-9 sensitivity setting, although this requires some tweaking until you find the right setting for each camera
* Daytime video quality is excellent and good enough to read stationary license plates up to about 50 feet.
* Audio quality is amazing! Individual birds and nearby bees can be heard easily, and normal volume conversations within about 20 feet can be understood.

CONS:
* The cameras seem to require an active Internet connection, not just a wifi connection (although I could be wrong). This may be because the initial setup requires you to use cloud storage. This could become a problem if your Internet connection is lost or dropped.
* Initial setup requires storage in the cloud (for the free trial), even if you install a USB drive in the sync module. I have not found a way to disable the cloud storage. This cloud storage requirement may be slowing down the entire system, since it forces everything to constantly use the Internet.
* Setup instructions were weird and unintuitive. The included booklet simply said to install the app. And the app is kind of confusing at first, and I ended up trying to create an account (and failing) and adding the sync module several times until I figured out what it was doing (and I'm an experienced techie). The basic problem is the app requires cameras to be installed only by following certain steps, with no other option.
* Setup requires the mobile app and an active internet connection to install the cameras.
* Accessing the cameras and video clips requires the mobile app. There are no desktop app or web options.
* Cannot schedule individual cameras. The weekly/hourly schedule can only be set for all cameras attached to a sync module. This is unfortunate and will make the scheduling feature useless for most people. It would also be helpful to be able to set quality, motion detection sensitivity, and IR settings on a schedule. The settings I use for night time would be different than the middle of the day or when I'm not at home.
* No quality setting on the audio. There are multiple settings for quality of the videos, to conserve batteries, but there's no way to turn down the audio quality, for battery conservation. The included audio quality is great, but it seems to be ""too"" high for the purpose of these cameras.
* Only 2 AA batteries in each camera. This could become very cumbersome to replace batteries if your camera is installed in a hard-to-reach location. The cameras SHOULD have 6, 8, or 10 batteries instead, so you don't have to replace them often. I would happily pay the extra battery cost so that I wouldn't have to climb up there very often.
* When a camera is ""in use"", its settings cannot be changed, and if you try to change the settings, you'll get an error message, causing the app's settings screen to get out of sync with the camera's actual settings, until you go back and modify the settings again.
* The ""Talk"" feature produces garbled, broken, delayed (by 3-5 seconds) audio that is unintelligible, no matter how close the camera and sync module are to your router. I have about 115 Mbps bandwidth, and it made no difference. You will never be able to use this to have a conversation of any type, even if they could understand what you're saying. This seems like a very odd flaw since the recorded audio is so excellent. This was obviously an oversight by the engineers.
* The Android app's setting to disable the vibration on notifications doesn't work. It always uses my phone's setting and ignores the app's setting.
* Insects near my 4 cameras are causing 15-30 false alerts per day right now, until I can figure out a better placement or setting. Other than the wear on the batteries, this is not a huge deal, but it can be annoying.
* The installation hardware is inadequate. Each camera comes with 2 large wood screws that are too big and too long for almost every installation. Much smaller wood screws and double-sided tape or Velcro would have been much more practical. I ended up not using any of the screws that came with the cameras because they were too big or impossible to use on the required surfaces.
* The back panels on the cameras are VERY weird to remove for battery installation. There are no instructions that I could find on how to do this, and the included plastic tools are not intuitive. I nearly broke one of the cameras trying to get the back panel off using the included tool. There's a certain trick to hooking and unhooking the tool from the back panel that you'll have to figure out on your own.
* The cameras and lenses are fully exposed to sunlight and weather, which is not ideal. The cameras should come with a small hood the lens or camera to protect it even more from weather and shade from light.
* User access cannot be customized. The only way to give someone access to a camera is to give them your password to your account and entire system. It would be helpful to be able to grant someone limited or temporary access, such as a neighbor, child, relative, or visitor.",positive

It was the least expensive hub I could find at the time at under $10 and works well for what I needed, so I am very pleased with the purchase.

My original idea was to use it as a backup charger for my MacBook Air M1 (M1 2020) purchased last year, and possibly use it as a backup charger for my MacBook Pro 15"" (Mid 2014). To enable the latter, I included a ""Nylon Braided USB C to Magnetic Charging Cable Cord"" in my original order with the charger.

I expected that the charger would work with my MacBook Air M1, but was not sure about it working with my older MacBook Pro and it's MagSafe connector. For this function a good USB-C to MagSafe cable cord would be required. The cord I selected was a pink nylon braided cable by Yoamp, just short of 5 feet in length. Though it had few reviews, they were all positive, so I felt it was worth the risk. (Side note - I decided on pink so that it would be easy to identify and locate visually.)

As expected, the charger worked very well with my MacBook Air M1, recharging the laptop a little faster than the original Apple charger. Though I don't use this charger as much as the original charger, I've have no problems when I do use it. Also, the charger never seems to get more than warm; unlike other chargers that I've read about.

As for my MacBook Pro 15"", I found that connecting the Yoamp cord to this charger, and then my laptop didn't seem to work - at first. However, upon further inspection, I realized that the USB-C connector needed to be pushed in a little more to created a ""click"" and solid connection with the charger. Once that was done everything seemed to work perfectly. In subsequent uses, the charger never seems to ""heat up"" though it will get slightly warm at times. Overall I'm extremely please with it in this function.

In conclusion, after 6 weeks of use, this charger has performed well in a dual purpose role. As a backup charger for my MacBook Air M1 it's close to a perfect choice. As a backup for my 2014 MacBook Pro 15"", I have no complaints so far. I will update this review if I discover any new characteristics or problems.",positive

430,Electronics,2021 Apple TV 4K (32GB),$119.99,5,"Photos are a comparison of the last 4 generations of AppleTV: 3rd generation, HD, 4K, and this newest box; and the old Siri remote vs the new remote.

If you liked the previous generation of the AppleTV, the original 4K, then you will like this new iteration. Because, it is near as makes no difference, exactly the same. Oh, there are spec sheet differences like higher frame 4K video for uncommon content and extremely modern TVs. And the processor has been bumped a couple generations, but I can’t tell the difference; it was plenty fast before and it’s plenty fast now.

The remote is better. I had given the previous AppleTV 4 stars because the remote was a fragile, quirky, easily lost, tiny, button poor collection of Apple’s worst design impulses. I bought brightly colored cases for my remotes so I wouldn’t lose them, or forget which end was which. The new remote is more substantial, easier to perform such basic actions as skipping forward in videos. Has a mute button! Now I don’t have to volume down to zero to mute. With a power button so I don’t have to do the square button long press, slide and click to sleep. I can grab it and figure out which end is which without fumbling. Perhaps most importantly, my wife, who never figured out the old remote, uses this one without issue.

From such small gifts come an additional star.

Readjusting to the new remote continues. I still have muscle memory for the old remote and tend to press the play button when I mean to talk with Siri, and the mute button when I mean to pause. I’d say the old remote is better at swiping left or right, but the new remote is massively better at single directional clicks; it’s practical now to skip forward in single hops instead of swiping around and hoping I land about where I want to scrub in a timeline. The new remote also has a hard to discover feature where resting your thumb on the side of the “track wheel” while pausing video will enable a kind of iPod scrolling through videos. Very precise and makes skipping over commercials in Tablo much easier. Apps that don’t use the standard playback controls don’t necessarily get this feature.

Owners of previous generations can just buy the new remote separately and save themselves the cost of a new box when there are no other compelling features. For example, the new color calibration feature using the iPhone 12 will work with older boxes too. I bought a new remote from Apple for the original AppleTV 4K in my bedroom and it paired in seconds and has been a pleasure to use. The larger size is a surprisingly important feature as it’s easier to find even when amongst the folds of an unmade bed, and fits my hand better.

If it’s comparable to the old remote, it will need charging every 4-6 months with ample onscreen warning. I would not worry about the non-replaceable batteries. I doubt the typical remote will be charged as many as 20 cycles in its lifetime. By the way, do not charge it unless the AppleTV warns you as you don’t want to wear out the battery with too many cycles. This is not a device you want to daily charge.

For those who are buying an AppleTV for the first time, I recommend it if the following is true: you use an iPhone, you have adequate network speed for 4K content, somewhere around 50-100 Mbit should be adequate, you buy iTunes content like movies and TV series. If you want HomeKit automation. If none of these are true, then some other streaming box is likely a better fit.

Apple designs the best low wattage computer chips in the world today, and it is no surprise that the 2+ year old A12 in this box leads to a snappy interface. Apps launch fast, list of thumbnails scroll smoothly and briskly. I’ve never complained of a lack of speed with an AppleTV 4K of either generation.

My most commonly used app is YouTube and it is fine, if not as full featured as the iPhone version. The occasional 4K video looks excellent on this platform. If you’d look at my network traffic reports, you see I go through videos by the terabyte. The only hiccup had been the occasional loss of pause button functionality, which they finally fixed. And I wish it were easier to turn on close captioning and leave them on.

The large number of movies in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in the iTunes library give my TV, a Sony A80J, a chance to show what it is capable of. Details in the dark and eye searing highlights come through and give me my money’s worth. And my library frequently sees movies I’ve already paid for refreshed in Dolby Vision. Recently, the Indiana Jones movies suddenly showed up in these formats, nice. On the other hand sometimes, a movie will require a second purchase to get Dolby Vision, and that’s aggravating and something I've yet to do.

I should mention the existance of an Apple TV app on many modern televisions, including my Sony A80J and my LG CX. It is adequate at finding and excellent at displaying iTunes content—I can't tell any difference in quality between using a real AppleTV or the integrated app on my LG CX—but I'm not going to log into Google TV to see how it works on the Sony. I'd prefer privacy, something I'm not going to get from smart TVs from ad-revenue driven corporations.

Dolby Atmos, is a nice to have feature, and many movies will feature it and its near mandatory rainy or helicopter scenes. The first chance I had to get into my new TV room’s attic, I put in overhead speakers for Atmos. And I just did the same in the basement media room. Well worth crawling around pulling some speaker wire. As a bonus, Apple has recently started remixing selected music tracks in an Atmos compatible format: Spatial Audio, which places the listener in a much more immersive location in the sound field. So, for times when you really want to listen to foreground music it’s a great feature.

I’m not a fan of the TV+ app as it is too focused on selling content and services.

There are many 3rd party apps, and I watch a lot of Hulu and VRV. The Channels app is a good to have if you have an antenna and an HDHomeRun. The Tablo app is a must to have if a bit slow if you own a Tablo network DVR. Cord cutters can pretty much fill there content needs and get away from cable television. The Netflix app, when I used it, was one of the better implementations I’d seen.

I’d say very few people will notice a difference between the 32 and 64 GB versions. Maybe, with slow networks with a lot of rewatched content or large games. Save a bit of money.

I’ve not been gaming on this box or its predecessor, not my thing and the games I tried did not compel. Still it has plenty of horsepower for most games. You will need a Bluetooth controller though as Apple has removed the gyroscope functionality from the remote. Not that the original Siri remote was a good controller anyway.

Happy this still has a Gigabit Ethernet port as wired networking is reliable networking.

As my home uses HomeKit, this acts as my hub, a centralized computer tying together the switches, thermostats, garage openers, and other smart devices in the house. A reliable system, although if you don’t need a streaming box, a HomePod Mini is cheaper and will also act as a hub, albeit sans Ethernet.

Harmony remotes are no longer being made as modern streaming boxes control receivers and TVs so well. The AppleTV coexists with my Sony TV and Yamaha receiver to the point I go months without touching their remotes. All I really need is to turn the system on and off, mute, and adjust the volume and this does so well and reliably.

As a developer, I’d say Apple has gone well out of its way to make porting iOS apps to tvOS almost easy. The introduction of Combine and SwiftUI should make it possible for developers to repurpose their apps to the Mac and the AppleTV with little initial effort. Certainly, I’d recommend any iOS developer own an AppleTV and think of which features might be useful on the big screen.

As someone who uses an AppleTV every day, I appreciate the high level of technology, reliability, integration with other tech, speed, frequent software updates, new features delivered for free, and Apple’s privacy focus. As I just recently added a TV to my new home, I was happy to pick up this new model to replace an AppleTV HD, but I probably would not have replaced a first generation 4K with this model. However, I purchased just the remote for the original 4K model in my bedroom and have been happy with the decision.",positive
431,Electronics,2021 Apple TV 4K (32GB),$119.99,4,"I am listing my pros and cons. No particular order. Just writing it down as it comes to mind.

I got this because I heard great things about it. I have a big end Samsung tv and honestly my tv runs a bit better except for the HBO App, that runs better on Apple TV. If you have a regular smart tv then this would be really nice too but if you’re on a budget then the roku ultra 4k works just a well (I have that too).

I saw someone here complain about the track pad about how it’s to easy to hit the track pad and mess things up. If you do not like the track pad (I do) there’s an option in the setting that lets you turn off the trackpad and just use it as physical push down buttons (they even made a picture on how they could improve the controller. They did an apple vs their changes would be. )

If you have HDR enabled snd you watch a video no in HDR, it will make your picture look washed out in terms of colors. You can change it to SDR and your colors will look nice and vibrant.

You cannot do Netflix trivia games or YouTube “VR” videos as it does not allow you to do some for some reason. Those videos where you can interact with it. For something that can handle games you’d think they would allow you to do that. Seems silly. Same with 360 videos where you can use your controller to look around, you cannot do that with Apple TV.

It can be annoying to sync up your controller to home theater systems. Have to do the learn remote or whatever and hope it works.

Sometimes when you click “back” it doesn’t register snd you have to do it twice.

If you have an iPhone, you can use your iPhone to type instead of the controller. Much easier to search and log into streaming services.

The voice search works well. If you want to make a “home button” you can change the tv icon on the controller to go from going into Apple TV streaming app or to home where all your apps are located.

The Apple TV app will show where your left off on all your shows regardless of streaming platform snd once you click the show, it will automatically open it in that streaming app. Makes it easier to just pick up and go from where you left off instead of searching for the app, searching for the show, and clicking where you left of.

There’s a few “hidden” features within the controller which you can honestly google like holding down the ok button to move your apps around, double tapping the tv icon to load up all the apps you have open and you can then force close them or select the one you want. So on.

I will update if I think of more lol",positive
432,Electronics,2021 Apple TV 4K (32GB),$119.99,5,"I was a PC guy. PC this, PC that. It was when I got my first iPhone did I slowly transition to nearly everything Apple. Eventually, I got the original Apple TV 4K and now I have the upgraded 2021 version.

— DESIGN —
This box is identical in size to the original TV 4K. This was great for me because it fits behind the same Apple TV mount hidden behind my TV. The only things that have changed are the internal technologies and you get a newly designed remote control.

— TECHNOLOGY —
If you're upgrading from the previous 4K version, you will notice a noticeable speed jump in terms of start-up times for apps. Everything feels quicker and you'll be wasting less time for loading.

The Wifi on this is 802.11ax or Wifi 6. This means it's faster than having a direct wired connection (goodbye, cables!)

The 32GB capacity I got is more than enough for the multitudes of apps I have. I don't use it for games or storing photos so I have so much extra space.

It also supports Dolby Vision and HDR10, which is great when I'm ready for that; but I'm still fine with my 3D HDTV.

Audio output supports Dolby Digital 7.1, but honestly, I don't think most people with a surround system have strayed beyond 5.1.

— WHO IS IT FOR —
If you steam the major platforms like Disney+, Netflix, HBO Max, Paramount+, and Amazon Prime, consider getting this. The apps function quickly and flawlessly.

The price is premium compared to Fire Stick and Roku, but you're paying not just for the Apple name, but a slick and quick interface that incorporates all the media platforms you consume. Time is money and you don't want to be spending your life waiting for apps to load, do you?

— SUMMARY —
If you've been slowly growing your iTunes Movie/TV/Music library, then definitely get this. It's a no-brainer. You're already in the ecosystem, so you might as well enjoy a well-designed TV platform to view your media. Highly recommended.",positive
433,Electronics,2021 Apple TV 4K (32GB),$119.99,5,"Our living room TV is pretty much on 24/7 because we don't all work the same shift. I've tried two each of three other brands and two quit almost immediately. One, (both samples) was so bad that the TV had to be unplugged from the wall to unlock it, even after unplugging the HDMI cable. The third worked, but had to be reset regularly. (That got to be a running joke with two of my toddler-aged Grand kids who would do the little dance that the letters in the logo would do.) I'm happy to report that this one can hold up to 24/7 use with no issues.

As far as picture and sound quality goes, the limiting factors are the source, internet connection/WiFi, and the panel itself. So this one was pretty much neither better nor worse than the others in that respect. It just holds up without crashing better. That alone makes it worth the price difference.

The control syntax is typical Apple. One nice thing is you can put the remote functions on an iPad or iPhone, but in my case it didn't like to release if I did that. That may be our phones, though as we have antiques. (One iPhone 7 and one iPhone 8. They may as well have cranks on the side! As in ""Operator, get me PEnnsylvania-Six-Five-Thousand."" And yes, the ""E"" is supposed to be capitalized.) That does make it easier to type in search field or password fields if you don't want to use the voice control, otherwise there isn't too much advantage. The pad in the middle of the 4-way can be used as a track pad with different levels of sensitivity available, or set to push only. It feels more solid than most, and smaller, with a built-in rechargeable battery rather than AA or AAA cells. I like it, and even my technophobe Wife learned it in short order.

Even after a year I'm not quite used to streaming versus linear (I believe it's called) TV. I keep wanting to be able to enter channel numbers directly. On the other hand, my live service and a couple of premium services cost about ½ what cable or satellite costs, even after having to up my internet to unlimited. And the wider selection of programming, better than Blu-ray quality of movies, and being able to watch on my schedule without having to use a DVR are welcome bonuses. If you're on the fence because you have to buy your own equipment and up your internet, we could literally buy four of these a year with the money saved, and the unlimited internet is also faster. YMMV, of course.

Highly recommended, but I do miss the little dance.

Minor update: It's on virtually 24-7. I've had to reboot it twice because an app would lock (about 3 months as of this writing). I could probably get away with a different way of unlocking it, but that's the easiest. Not the whole device, so I could reboot from the settings menu, by the way, not by unplugging it from the wall. Speaking of... it's a plug, not a wall wart or line lump. Yay! And I mentioned it before, but think it's worth repeating. The sensitivity of the track pad is adjustable, or can be turned off altogether. I've seen a few reviews with people complaining it's too sensitive.

One last thing. It has an amazing screen saver. If you click the up arrow on the pad, it flashes a text on the bottom of the screen what you are seeing. Someone told me, but I haven't verified it yet, that the Mac Mini has the same one.

If I had the need, I'd buy a second in a heartbeat.",positive
434,Electronics,2021 Apple TV 4K (32GB),$119.99,5,"We've been using Roku on our home TVs for the past 6-7 years and we've tried virtually all types - the Roku 4K streaming sticks, the Premiere +, and the Roku Ultra. The Apple TV 4K is an improvement over all of them, offering smoother streaming experience that is perceptible both in terms of 4K HDR and HD content.

Roku is probably a bit easier to navigate, as some of the buttons on the Apple TV remote are strangely placed, but our Samsung TV remote actually doubles as another remote, and if you have iOS devices, they can easily become remotes too.

The Apple TV console itself is a heavier than the Roku consoles. During streaming and gaming, it gets warm, but so does Roku. It was reasonably easy to set up. The Samsung TV did not recognize it right away, but after fiddling with its settings (manual input), it did. If you have an iOS device, you can very quickly transfer account and wi-fi info to the console, and also use the iOS device to type in passwords, etc.

The only con at this point is the free space. After the initial setup, you will likely only have somewhere between 19 and 21 GB left, so if you want to download games from the Apple Arcade - there won't be much space to do so. Pairing an Xbox controller was relatively easy (but I had to unpair it first from another iOS device). Games look good and there is no lag (the A12 Bionic chip is good enough to handle even the more demanding types). 32 GB (29.5 GB really), however, is too little (if you care about games) and will quickly fill up.

All in all, this is a capable streaming console that is a step up over Roku and certainly a step up over Chromecast (one of our TVs has Chromecast). It is much pricier than both, which is another con, but seems worth the additional investment.",positive
435,Electronics,2021 Apple TV 4K (32GB),$119.99,4,"I admit, I am an Apple fan so it isn't a surprise that this is my favorite streaming device. I have one on each TV and a couple of previous versions. During Prime Day, this one was priced too well to pass up. I am replacing an older model on my office TV since it is a 4k. My favorite thing abut Apple TVs is the UI which is in my opinion the cleanest of all streaming devices, just the App icon, not a ton of video titles. I like the ability to have folders for certain apps which allow a uncluttered main screen. I like that it is easy to pick up where I left off on the home screen. I feel it is the best of them all.

The only thing that I have no liked about the Apple TVs of late are the remote. While the new remote is a step in the right direction, removing that frustrating touchpad from previous models, it is not perfect. I like the power button and the clickable dial button, but why the need to move the Siri button to the side? I find i inadvertently hit it more than I like and the moment you do, whatever you were watching pauses. Not a big deal but I watch movies and shows with friends via Mumble (voip) since we all live in different places and we have to resync once I turn Siri off. Not a normal problem for most though, just me. They could have put it on the top of the remote on the opposite side of the power button.

I honestly don't think they will ever come out with the perfect remote, but this is a step in the right direction.",positive

The menu on the Apple TV is easy to navigate and if you already have other Apple devices like an iPhone, the Apple TV can copy in most of the settings from the iPhone and almost completely set itself up. As far as the remote controlling other connected devices like a TV or surround sound, it is easy to set up and once set up, it just works. My only complaint about the Apple TV is just Apple being Apple. A lot of content that is available in iTunes or Apple's proprietary apps is made not available for purchase or rent in other third party apps, such as Vudu. Seems you can log into the app via a Windows PC and make the purchase and the content will then be able to be viewed on the Apple TV via the third party app so not the end of the world.

Your iPhone also can act as a remote without downloading any other apps.

5* review for successfully resolved my low 2.4G speed problem, excellent support from TP Link and fast 5G speed that exceeds Verizon Fios max speed of 300Mbps.

The purpose of this review is to compare the 2.4G and 5G speeds of the TP Link Archer A7(AC1700) WiFi 5 router and AX21(AX1800) WiFi 6 router using an iPhone 11 which supports WiFi 6. The highest speed I can test is 300Mbps limited by my Verizon Internet plan. Measurement results using show that using the WiFi 5 router, the 2.4G speed is 60M/80M (UL/DL) and the 5G speed is 307M/330M, whereas using the WiFi 6 router, the 2.4G speed is 110M/120M and the 5G speed is about same.

Newer routers’ real life 5G speed is very high and normally is not a problem, but real life 2.4G speed could be slow. It is not entirely sure which part of the wireless link is limiting the 2.4G speed. Below examines the speed limit of the WiFi standards involved, the router and iPhone 11. The routers are TP Link’s Archer A7(AC1700) and AX21(AX1800). Measured speeds at 2.4G and 5G will also be given.

Router (TP Link) Specs and Supported WiFi Standards
1) Archer A7(AC1700) has has 3 antennas is a WiFi 5 router
2.4G : 450Mbps
5G: 1300M bps
Supported Standards: AX21(AX1800) : 802.11ac(Wi-Fi 5), 802.11b, 802.11ax(Wi-Fi 6), 802.11n(Wi-Fi 4), 802.11g

802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax are also called Wi-Fi 4, WiFi 5 and WiFi 6 respectively.

2) AX21(AX1800) has 4 antennas is a WiFi 6 router
2.4G: 574M bps
5G: 1200M bps.
Supported Standards: AX7 (AC1700) 802.11b, 802.11n, 802.11g, 802.11ac

A7 (AX1800) is a low cost ($60) popular (listed as “Amazon Choice”) WiFi 5 router which supports 802.11 ac whereas AX 21 is a low cost ($90) WiFi 6 router which supports 802.11 ax. WiFi 6 (max speed 9.6G) not only has higher speed than WiFi 5 (max speed 3.5G) but also can support more devices using orthogonal frequency division multiple access. The main differences are given in picture 1.
(Picture 1 from : https://www.mwrf.com/technologies/systems/article/21849959/whats-the-difference-between-wifi-5-and-wifi-6)

Comparing the specs of these two routers, one has a higher 2.4G speed while the other has a higher 5G speed. But in real life, according to my measurements, at 2.4G, the WiFi 6 router has almost twice the speed than the WiFi 5 router. I don’t have a high enough wireless speed plan to test the 5G speed. In my house both routers have the same speed of 310M, limited by the max speed allowed by Verizon Fios 300M.

Speeds specified by the WiFi standards are speeds the router manufacturers trying to meet and they are not the limit, but speeds advertised by the router are the speeds that customers want the router to be able to reach. They become upset if they are unable to get the speeds advertised by the router.

Routers often do not specified under what link conditions these seemingly advertised high speeds could be realized. For example what is the required bandwidth, the number of antennas (the so called MIMO) and how pure the signal has to be (the signal to noise ratio). Is the bandwidth 20, 40, 80 or 160M? Is the signal to noise ratio has to be greater than 10dB?

In real life, link speed depends on how far from the router (the signal strength) and radio interference which falls in band (the signal to noise ratio). The former can be solved by doing the speed test right next to the router, where the transmit signal from the router is at maximum. But for the latter, unless one has a so called Faraday Cage, there is no way to block in-band interference especially at 2.4G, which are used by microwave ovens, Bluetooth and many household devices. Interference is hard to quantify without using a spectrum analyzer and could become an excuse if one calls the router support line complaining low speed.

Another limit is the device itself, and in this case iPhone 11. It’s specs are given below.

Wi-Fi specifications for iPhone 11
802.11 standard, name, frequency Maximum PHY data rate Maximum channel bandwidth Maximum MCS index Maximum spatial streams
ax@5 GHz 1200 Mbps 80 MHz 11 (HE) 2/MIMO
ac@5 GHz 866 Mbps 80 MHz 9 (VHT) 2/MIMO
a/n@5 GHz 300 Mbps 40 MHz 7 (HT) 2/MIMO
ax@2.4 GHz 195 Mbps 20 MHz 9 (HE) 2/MIMO
b/g/n@2.4 GHz 144 Mbps 20 MHz 7 (HT) 2/MIMO
(From: https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/iphone-wi-fi-specification-details-dep268652e6c/web)

https://mcsindex.com gives more details about how the speed on each band is affected by modulation scheme, number of antennas, bandwidth and WiFi standards used, not only for iPhones but for routers as well.

From the iPhone 11 specs, only “n” and “ax” support 2.4GHz if we ignore the older standards “b” and “g”. At 2.4G, The maximum speeds for “n” is 144M whereas for “ax” is 195M. The max bandwidth for both is 20MHz which needs to be set in the router. Setting the bandwidth to 40MHz could lower the speed as the noise power will be doubled.

However, at 5GHz the speed for ac (WiFi 5) is 866M with 80M max bandwidth whereas for ax (WiFi 6) is 1200M also with 80M max bandwidth. These bandwidths should also be specified in the router. Setting the bandwidth too high or too low could lower the speed.

From the iPhone 11 max speeds, it is clear that the wireless link’s speed is not limited by both the A7 and AX21 routers and the standards, but by the iPhone 11 at 2.4G and by Verizon Fios at 5G.

I have Verizon Fios 300M download and upload. Initially, I used an A7, thinking that at 2.4GHz, the router speed is 450M which is higher than iPhone’s 144M(“n”) and 195M(“ax), surely shouldn’t be a problem. But speed test showed that I got only 60M download and 80M upload from the best channel and 20M bandwidth (I tested all the channels and bandwidth combinations).

60M is too slow for me because I have several devices (such as security cameras) using 2.4G. So I called TP Link support line to see what I had done wrong. Most customer supports didn’t know what the problem was the and finally I was connected to a high level support. She said that in real life, I had to multiply the speed by 30-50% and guided me through the various specs of the wireless link. I don’t know where the 30-50% comes from, perhaps it was her empirical experience. If I use the average of 40% and assume that applies to the lower speed of the router and the iPhone, which is 144MHz. 40%x144M is 57M. This was about what I got at 2.4G using the A7 router.

But she also said something about WiFi 6 router and got me thinking perhaps a WiFi 6 router could improve the speed. (I must say that I got excellent support from TP Link, I had gotten calls twice from the specialist unsolicited and many followup emails. All trying to help me solve the low speed problem.)

I then change the A7(AC1700) to an AX21(AX1800), which does support WiFi 6 “ax”.

The main advantage of using AX21 is that it raised the iPhone 11 max speed at 2.4G from 144M to 195M, a gain of 51M. And as a result, in real life, the 2.4G link speed seemed to have increased by about the same amount. Speed test showed that at 2.4G, I now got ~90-110M(download, previously 60M when using A7) and 100-120M(upload) with the channel and bandwidth set on auto. Though the download speed is still less than 195M, the link speed has increased by changing to a router that supports ax and has 4 antennas. Have no idea if a more expensive router will further increase the 2.4G speed.

However, at 5GHz, both routers give 307M download and 330M upload, limited by Verizon Fios max speed of 300M.

When doing speed test, I shut off all 2.4G emitters. I live in a rural area and I suspect there is little interference.

A7 has 3 antennas whereas AX21 has four. Is the speed improvement at 2.4G due to the additional antenna or the support of WiFi 6 or both?",positive
471,Electronics,"TP-Link AC1750 Smart WiFi Router (Archer A7) -Dual Band Gigabit Wireless Internet Router for Home, Works with Alexa, VPN Server, Parental Control, QoS",$53.99,5,"I am a very senior citizen with limited computer experience. I had a 10 year old Archer C7 router that I wanted to replace with a new C7. I had a problem understanding the installation video so I contacted customer service to try to understand if there was a problem. I did a chat with customer service and then they sent me an e mail. I had further questions and my e mails were answered within hours. I did not exactly get an answer to my question, but that may be because I didn't know enough terminology to frame it correctly. I was trying to find out what they meant in the instructions that said do not connect router to modem if there is another network on modem. My internet provider refers to the setting where I connect to the internet as a part of their network. So I was trying to find out if that connection to the modem was something I should worry about.
I finally got an e mail saying that I should make sure that no other devices were connected to the modem. It took a while, but they kept trying. I was able to set up the router and used the quick setup guide at the
TPLink web site. One problem I had was that the instructions and the web site did not really stress enough the need to go to the network setting of your internet provider, and connect to the internet there. ;
On windows eleven the network settings are hidden, and when you click on the internet connection icon on the lower right hand part of the screen you don't see the various settings. By settings I mean the place where you enter your router password and connect to your internet service provider. In earlier windows the setting appeared when you clicked on the internet icon. Now you have to hit a > icon on the menu to find the internet connections. The internet connection for the C7 is TP-Link_90C2. Once you connect there you have a seciure internet connection. My problem was that after I ran the quick install I got a message you can now use the internet, and I was connected to the internet. However it was not a stable connection, and I lost it twice before I figured out that I needed to go to the windows 11 icon and then to my internet providers connection to get a stable connection.
I rate customer service very high for quickness of response and patience with new user in trying to help me understand the product. I rate the instructions as not so great. I rate my ability to read the instructions as poor. Maybe they pointed out the need for the internet connection on windows 11, but it wasn't in big enough print or underlined enough for me to get it.
The product is also very good once I got it set up. I am getting more speed than my internet provider says it is providing me. Maybe some of my neighbors mgh is coming into my apartment. I am still getting a slight bit of buffering in loading some web sites, but I don't think this is a router problem. I don't know because I cant use wifi analyzer with my c7. There is no way to pick your channels, you have to hope that the C7 does it correctly. Customer service patiently explained to me that I should relax, big brother router was going to solve it. Maybe so, but I still get some buffering. HOwever it is just on a few sites, and for a few seconds so i can live with it. Overall, i give the whole experience five stars, but the interface was a little confusing or maybe it was the instructions I should give four stars.",positive
472,Electronics,"TP-Link AC1750 Smart WiFi Router (Archer A7) -Dual Band Gigabit Wireless Internet Router for Home, Works with Alexa, VPN Server, Parental Control, QoS",$53.99,5,"I have a pretty extensive home network at my house. In the past I've used predominantly Cisco/Linksys or Netgear devices. Lately however, I have stop using Linksys devices because their reliability is not what it used to be. This router is replacing a two year old Linksys router. Routers utilize solid-state circuitry and shouldn’t be failing as often as they do.

Netgear router‘s seem to be reliable although my reason for not using Netgear is due to their awful firmware. I had a pair of Netgear nighthawk router’s set up in my house. Those routers were purchased because they supported OpenDNS which allows you to have very reliable and easy to configure content filtering for children and for advertisements. Despite the fact that the router Is advertised as supporting OpenDNS, Netgear pushed out an update which rendered OpenDNS unusable. Netgear partnered with Disney and are forcing you to use the absolutely awful and practically useless Disney circle content filtering for children. Not only does it not work and ends up filtering just about everything, rendering the computer useless, but there’s no way to turn it off and return to using OpenDNS.

I called tech-support about it and not only did they not even understand the terminology that I was using while discussing the problems with the router, but they were truly slow and stupid. For a simple question, it would take them five minutes to look up an answer when anybody with a grade C in high school computer science should be able to answer those questions.

They were idiots and I was stuck with a router that I purchased for a specific advertised function which they removed less than two months after I purchased the hundred dollar router brand new. That’s pretty pathetic and I won’t support Netgear any longer due to their unfair business practices. On The front and rear of my house, I employ two TP-Link WNR841N routers. They were only $20 when I bought them about five years ago. These two routers cover my front yard and my backyard for when I have guests over or am doing yard work.

These inexpensive routers have been running for all of this time, protected only by old candy boxes which I painted and sealed for exterior use. That being said, these two TP-Link router‘s have been outside in the weather at temperatures as high as 103 in the summer and as low as 15° below zero. They have never failed once. I never have to reboot them [although the firmware has an option to schedule automatic reboots which I do once per week to refresh DNS and NetBIOS entries], I never have to do any updates on them, and so far I’ve never had to replace them.

Over the last six or seven years I have been purchasing almost nothing but TP-Link router‘s for people that ask me to help them with their network or computers. I have never gotten any complaints from anybody about their router, and the oldest one that I bought is about seven years old and it still works, although I’m not using it anymore because my two main routers need to support 802.11 AC. This is the second router of this model which I purchased. The first one was purchased for a friend of mine who had problems at his house with a D-Link router that stopped working after just over a year. That was about a year ago so far and he's never called about it. No news is good news; I assure you.

I bought this to replace my Netgear Nighthawk which I mentioned earlier. I installed it about two weeks ago and so far have not had a single issue with it. The interface is very fast and the WiFi signal is very reliable. The way they laid out the GUI Is nice but the menu on the left has a pretty big flaw.

The menu on the left employs a collapsible menu design which extends past the bottom of the screen if you open any of the menus, rendering the other options impossible to see or interact with. There is a scroll bar for you to use but the scroll bar is tiny and automatically disappears into the background so you don’t even know there’s a scroll bar there. TP-Link should re-think the menu design. I would also like to see them allow you to save changes per page without restarting the router. I experienced some minor inconvenience while setting up my router because on a couple of occasions I wanted to make multiple changes to the settings before rebooting the router and enabling those changes, however the router doesn’t provide a method for you to save changes without rebooting right away.

Despite the couple of firmware design mistakes, I am quite satisfied with this router and would definitely buy again. It's undoubtedly going to be an even better (damn near perfect, probably) certainly be more satisfied after I install open WRT on it. I will continue to be a TP Link customer for as long as they keep their prices low and quality at or above where it is now.",positive

It worked like a charm just that I only wished I'd get more coverage but that could be solved with an extender OR going the Moca route which I did and was still good.

Come around to August of 2022, I got 1gig Fiber installed by TDS and was still using this router and noticed a big bottleneck through the ethernet ports (Limited to around 360 down/up). I thought I was going to get 1 gig through because of the ethernet ports being able to support 1 gig but even though it may be able to support 1 gig on the ethernet ports it does not have the capability to output close to 1 gig. Therefore I just turned it into an access point for upstairs to get more coverage and bought a new router that was able to output almost 1 gig via ethernet.

Overall it ran its course and I would say that it did its job, just kind of wished that there was more information bolded/highlighted of what it could output.",positive

Gigabit Ethernet is a minimum for wired service now days. The 5GH signal does drop off quickly, so you do not want to use this in a large or two story house. In a smaller home, it is more than adequate. The 2.4GH signal is really only for older legacy electronics. It is slow compared to the 5GH band.
I love the TP-Link firmware. It is a very feature rich, well organized GUI. I also truly appreciate the continued updates, two already this year, and the ease of downloading and installing within the GUI.
I also appreciate the feature to schedule periodic reboots to clear out the cache and keep the router running at peak performance. Kudos to the firmware development team.",positive

I was reluctant to replace my 15 yr old Linksys router, but it finally stopped working. I really didn't care that my internet speeds were slowed down by the old router. It didn't drop the internet often, when it did, I just unplugged it and plugged it back in & was almost instantly back online. Plus the Geek Squad set it up for me. During the 15 yrs, I unsuccessfully tried to setup another router & was intimidated by the experience. This time I had no choice.

My experience setting up the Archer A7 was not a good one...however, a couple weeks later after much frustration, I realized all the problems I experienced were user errors.

What I did that I shouldn't have done:
--My first mistake was using the 15 yr old ethernet cable. I figured it worked for the Linksys it should be good. After a week of the most unstable, frustrating wireless experience ever...it sometimes dropped every few minutes, I finally decided to try a new Ethernet cable. I didn't use the short one that came with the Archer, I had a long one that I could attach to my laptop. In case the wireless was still dropping, I wanted to wire my laptop to the modem. Well, the new ethernet cable made a difference for about 24 hours, then wireless started dropping again. Boy, was I upset and frustrated!!! Plus, my HP LaserJet Pro wouldn't print wirelessly. geesh...was I upset.
--My 2nd mistake was using the 15 yr old adapter. All the old cables, and cords on the modem and old router were/are short. It was difficult to even pick the modem up to attach/detach anything which is why I used the old adapter which was plugged into an extremely hard to reach outlet. After another week of absolutely, insane frustration and hours of research, I finally used the adapter that came with the Archer...and yes the cord is even shorter than the old adapter cord, but finally wireless stopped dropping and actually hasn't dropped since.
The only remaining problem was getting my HP LaserJet to print wirelessly.

---Lesson learned...when it's suggested to use new cables, etc. I need to follow that advice. I was so ready to rent a router from our cable company, Spectrum, but kept putting off calling them.

----Today, I finally got the LaserJet to print wirelessly. At the beginning of this mess (that I pretty much created myself) I had to reinstall the printer driver which I did during the time the wireless kept dropping. I didn't & still don't have time to spend researching all the errors I was experiencing, but finally realized I needed to reinstall the printer driver again. This time the instructions I followed were a bit different and a few steps had different results which made more sense. The 2nd reinstall solved the problem. My LaserJet is finally printing wirelessly again.

Actually I don't have a lot of experience with all this stuff, but have spent time through my years of using computers that I kind of learned my way around. I used the internet extensively to search for answers and understand terms that were new to me.

Because I have so many wireless devices setup, I didn't want to have to set them up again so I used my old network name and password.
With the new Archer A7, I am finally getting the internet speed I've been paying for and so far, haven't had a drop since I used a new ethernet cable and the included adapter.",positive

I was so excited something like this existed!

For the most part I’m really happy with it, it’s significantly better than what I was doing before and I don’t have to worry about interfering signals like you do with the radio based things like this. I also find it hilarious that when you turn it on, it says “Power On. Bluetooth connected” in a semi-Midwestern sounding accent. It also automatically switches off after a while once it loses the Bluetooth signal, if you forget to turn it off when you leave your car (though your music will keep transmitting until you’re out of range, so if you run into your house for 20 min and go back, it will all still have been going for 20 min).

The battery life isn’t bad, especially for my purposes. I only drive maybe 10 hours a week, and I have to recharge it every week or two, though it only takes a couple of hours to do. It does obnoxiously tell you every few minutes that the battery is low when it gets to that point, and I do wish it didn’t just continue doing that after the first time because it’s very disruptive.

It also interrupts your music if you get a phone call, repeating over and over “call from [entire phone number]” until you answer, it goes to voicemail, or until you actively silence the call, which I hate doing. So if you get a lot of phone calls this might not be great.

The sound is good, it slowly says “maximum volume” when you turn the volume all the way up on your phone, which I find a little annoying as well, but it works great and I haven’t had issues with it, even in these super hot summer days (I was worried because I keep it in the car).

Overall, I’m just really glad I’ve found something decent that only costs $16, because I had no clue how I was going to afford a new stereo.",positive

I've had the unit about a month now and didn't wanna write review until a road trip I just took (10+ hours)
So I use the unit daily on my way to and from work (about 20 minutes) and have no issues. Battery drops about 10% every 2 days. That's with leaving it on in the car until it auto shuts off. No issues there.
You can charge the unit while using it.
4.5 hour trip a state over. 2 days of city driving and 4.5 hours back. Still showed 20% charge.
No feedback while charging like other units.
Range is outstanding. I know atleast close to 40 yards.

My issues with the unit are.
Twice now it has distorted the music playing to the point you couldn't listen to it. Almost like the connection was bad while my phone was in the car beside it. The unit wasn't hot and the 3.5mm was in all the way. I turned both my phone and the unit off and back on and that got it. (Galexy s22 ultra)
Annoying narration of ""volume max"" when turning your phone up to max volume.
If i could change anything it would be the double sided 3.5mm they use. Instead of a --+-- design it could be made into the unit so the unit doesn't protrude from the device as far and that's one more point of failure as it is. 3.5mm are prone to waller out with alot of giggling.",positive

Found very little, so hopefully this will help someone. Like many virtual workers I am on virtual calls on my laptop most of the day. Being tethered to the laptop can be tiring. I own multiple wired and Blue Tooth headsets for different purposes (I am an audiophile and the sounds of a specific headset means I use it for different uses). For online conference calls I love my wired Bose headset for their comfort and sound, so I was not ready to give that up and needed a simple easy solution to give me the flexibility to walk around while on these calls that were streaming through my laptop (i.e. Zoom, Teams, etc..). I have used the product for 1 day for this review and will update if things change:
1. Connectivity to Blue Tooth on Laptop: Easy and no issues, seemed stable.
2. Sound: I had initial concerns with all these types of products about the microphone on the headset being overridden in lieu of the microphone on the product (but for the price I figured I would at least try). So far no-one has complained about issues hearing me, there does not appear to be any delays. Sound good on both my end and others on calls/meetings.
3. Charge and length of use: Still preliminary, but lasted through a few hours of meetings. I had a light day yesterday, we'll see what today brings.
Hope this helps and if I missed a question please post and I can answer. Seemed like most of the reviews are focused on conversion for non-Blue Tooth scenarios and found very little on this topic.",positive

It does everything it claims quite well except one HUGE caveat which I don't understand how 25k other reviews have completely missed.

You see, the way Bluetooth products auto-reconnect to your phone say like an Airpord is that when the airpord is in its case, it is turned off through magnets in the case and the earphone and when it is off it doesn't send a Bluetooth signal to your phone thus it isn't connected. When you take out the AirPods it turns on since the magents are no longer keeping it shut off and it is programmed to send a command to your phone to connect. Since it was paired once previously, the phone allows it to reconnect automatically.

This product claims to auto-reconnect, which, the only way it can do is through this precise shutting on and off function explained above but this product doesn't shut off automatically when you shut off the car because it has a battery (like why????). It shuts off 15 min after you are no longer connected to it which means you have to manually disconnect from Bluetooth or shut off the device manually. This defeats the entire purpose of this device which is to make your life easier and being more convenient. To make matters worse, it has a long 33-foot range. That is a NEGATIVE for this use case. If it had a 3-foot range instead, when you got out of the car it would automatically discount since it would be out of range and solve this issue.

Even worst, at least for me, it doesn't auto turn on with the car either so you have to turn it on manually at which point yes it will auto-reconnect because of what I explained earlier but that's more work than plugging your phone in.

If it didn't have a battery and would just shut off with the car and turn on with the car it would be a perfect product for this use case but as it stands currently it is TRASH for using as a car Bluetooth device because it is more work than a cable. There are a couple of other products on Amazon that are better suited for your car but I won't mention them by name because this product is good just not good for application in a car.

Also, I understand it needs power hence why it has a battery but your car has a car charger or a USB port for this exact reason. You can just connect it to those for power. Even with this product if you don't want to always charge it, you need to connect it to a USB port in the car at all times in addition to the aux port.
