0,Health & Household,"Amazon Basics AA High-Performance Alkaline Batteries, 10-Year Shelf Life, Easy to Open Value Pack",$5.96 - $26.62,5,"I tested the AA size Amazon brand battery to find out the actual usable capacity as compared to the AA Duracell Procell battery. The results showed that the Amazon battery is about 88 percent the capacity of the Duracell. If you calculate the cost per unit capacity, the batteries are almost identical. The Amazon battery was actually slightly more expensive when represented in cost per Watt-Hour. Because of this I would probably choose the Procell (if I can get a good price on it) just because it means less frequent battery changes. The Amazon battery is a surprisingly good battery though. You will probably barely notice the difference in capacity, so if you don't want to waste time shopping around then its a good choice.

I also performed the same test on Duracell Copper Top, and Energizer Max. Their performance was nearly identical to the Procell. More interestingly, I tested the Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA cell. This cell was 4 times the cost of a procell at $1.27 per cell! However the capacity was only 1.5 times that of the Procell. So don't waste your money on these batteries, they're much more expensive per unit of capacity. The capacity of all these batteries were measured in Watt-Hours. Here are the numbers.

AA Amazon Battery = 2.71 Wh. My cost per cell = $0.291. Cost per Watt-Hour = $0.107
AA Duracell Procell = 3.09 Wh. My cost per cell = $0.321. Cost per Watt-Hour = $0.104
AA Energizer Lithium = 4.86 Wh. My cost per cell = $1.27. Cost per Watt-Hour = $0.261

This test was done using an op-amp circuit to maintain a constant current load at 100ma. Voltage and current were being logged ounce per minute and this data was used to calculate the Amp-Hour with a 0.8 volt cutoff. The Watt-Hour was then calculated by multiplying the Amp-Hour by the average voltage from the beginning of the test to 0.8 volts. All batteries mentioned were tested using this same method. Note that the capacity of these batteries can change dramatically under different conditions. The same battery under a heavy load will have a fraction of the capacity that it would under a light load. This data is only good for a comparison when choosing what battery is worth buying at what price. Unless your device loads the battery at a constant current of 100ma.

In summery, the Amazon batteries are not bad batteries (at least based on this test using the AA cell). If you choose to shop around for a name brand battery, stay at or below $0.33 per cell. Anything above $0.33 per cell will be more expensive per unit capacity than the Amazon battery. Oh, and definitely stay away from the Energizer Lithium unless expense is not an issue. These batteries are only worth the additional cost if your application requires a light weight and relatively high capacity battery regardless of cost. These batteries are surprisingly light weight compared to an alkaline.lkaline.",positive

They are so cheap that I can use them in my flash for weddings, or real-estate and not worry about it when the power depletes. I just get another 4-pack.

I put 2 Energizer AA batteries into a flashlight that I have 2 of the exact same model. I turned them both on at the same time and left them on to compare run time. They were absolutely identical! I also ran the same test with 4 AA batteries in a portable fan I have 2 of. (identical models). Again, absolutely zero difference in run time! WELL worth the significant savings!

8,Health & Household,"Amazon Basics AA High-Performance Alkaline Batteries, 10-Year Shelf Life, Easy to Open Value Pack",$5.96 - $26.62,4,"Cheap is about all the positive I could say about it. They die pretty quickly. If you use energizer or Duracell, you might replace the AA batteries in the device a couple of time is it per year at most and that’s usually with medium usage. A few things that I’ve put these batteries into and barely use, I’ve had to replace them almost every time I go to use it. Like the Samsung remote I barely use still needs the battery changed every couple of months. But it is a big box for much cheaper than brand names so probably evens out.",positive
9,Health & Household,"Amazon Basics AA High-Performance Alkaline Batteries, 10-Year Shelf Life, Easy to Open Value Pack",$5.96 - $26.62,5,"I've purchased many different brands of batteries and Amazon has met my expectations every time. The value is great and the quality is just as good if not better than the ""other"" brands. I will continue to purchase these batteries.",positive
10,Health & Household,"Amazon Basics AAA High-Performance Alkaline Batteries, 10-Year Shelf Life, Easy to Open Value Pack",$3.65 - $23.93,4,"AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar. When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader. In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test & review.

I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:

Disch Rt | Capacity | Runtime | Sample use case
100 mA | 997 mAh | 10 hrs | Low-power LED flashlight
200 mA | 914 mAh | 4.5 hrs | Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight
400 mA | 623 mAh | 1.5 hrs | Motorized toy / bright LED flashlight

Note that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.

The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (~$0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.

Comparison:

These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:

Disch Rt | Capacity | Runtime
100 mA | 1005 mAh | 10 hrs
200 mA | 864 mAh | 4.3 hrs
400 mA | 670 mAh | 1.7 hrs

As you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are $0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about $0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries & organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the ~50% price premium.

Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:

Disch Rt | Capacity | Runtime
100 mA | 908 mAh | 9 hrs
200 mA | 590 mAh | 2.9 hrs
400 mA | 443 mAh | 1.1 hrs

My son loves the motorized Thomas the trains. We have about 20 of them and the sound soothes him for whatever reason. These amazon batteries are great seeing how we have to change replace the batteries every other day. After several hundred amazon batteries aaa and aa, you will find quite a few duds that do not work. Brand new out of the package and they do not work. So that’s my only complaint. I order 100 at a time because I know all of them will not work. The value for the money is worth it still compared to expensive brands like energizer.",positive

Result? Very pleased! In fact, we have been ordering these now for several years, and we have never been disappointed. The packaging is great for space-saving storage, and it's easy to open the top to retrieve the smaller groups packages inside.

The batteries themselves work just as well as any name brand battery on the market, and we have even had these last longer in a handful of instances when replaced at the same time as other batteries.",positive

We have a lot of remotes to various things from TVs to toy trucks. We are also a family that can never have too many flashlights ergo we need batteries quite frequently. I came across these Amazon Brand Batteries a couple of Christmases ago as I had purchased a lot of toys that of course Batteries Not Included…they were shipped quickly & I was amazed at the quality & long life of these batteries! We don’t have to change batteries in all the remotes nearly as often as we did with the name brand batteries! I will never buy another brand of battery again as long as Amazon makes these long lasting sensibly priced batteries!

20,Health & Household,Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Powder,$21.56 - $98.99,5,"I struggled all my life with taking large pills, powders and elixirs, basically anything that has a medicinal or bitter taste. I kept hearing about this powdered collagen and decided to do my research ( it took me 3 months), to become an informed participant. I do not consume any medicine, synthetic or herbal supplements. I first looked at large bodies of evidenced based research to support why I should consider consuming this product. I found tons and decided to give it a try. First, I bought the single serve and shook it up in a 16oz water bottle, then prayed I would not throw up. Barely and I mean barely any taste whatsoever. Moved on to purchasing a single serve blender---poured 200 ml of organic milk, a splash of carnation milk, 1tspn organic agave, 1tspn organic cocoa powder, 1 scoop collagen powder and 1 scoop maca powder..AGAIN you can't even taste the powder and no after taste. Results...joint pain gone! Hair growth 1 inch in 1 month, nails are stronger (I like short natural nails), skin--bye bye fine lines and fine wrinkles (the ones you see in the 5x magnifying mirror). For the sake of clarity, my goal was to address some joint pain. The ancillary advantages/outcomes was not what I was seeking--but I am not complaining. I make the shake everyday and drink it after my Pilates and elliptical workout in the am. Oh yes, for us women of a certain age...pre, during or post menopausal, it reduced the flame on and in the heat of the night episodes by 90% --get your sleep back. I am a former ballet dancer and while I am in good health and maintain an uncompromising size 6, I know I was taking my health for granted. Thinking that I could still hitch my wagon to the good genes shooting star. Well all good things come to an end and I really should have been taking supplements all along. Joint pain is reduced by 70% and I'm very pleased. I am not a physician and just sharing my personal results/observations (unintended and intended). I'm still pretty shocked at the results, as I had no expectations of a positive or negative outcome whatsover. Please do your research!",positive
21,Health & Household,Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Powder,$21.56 - $98.99,5,"I absolutely love this product! I am on my third tub and even though I started seeing benefits from taking this within two weeks, I wanted to really give it a chance to do its thing. I started taking this for skin health and a hopeful reduction in fine lines. I have taken collagen before, both a popular powdered marine collagen formula (that is pretty popular on Instagram) and one that sources its collagen from chicken and comes in a pill form. I took the marine collagen for at least 3-4 months and made it a couple months with the other one. This has given me far superior results to the others. First I will say that this dissolves just beautifully in warm liquids. I add it to my coffee in the morning and my tea in the evening. I also think that this is pretty much completely tasteless. There is no odor when opening the container and it is nearly undetectable in a beverage, especially once you get used to drinking it. I love that it helps keep me a little more full between meals while boosting the nutrition value of beverages I like to enjoy daily. As for my results, I started seeing increased nail growth in the first couple of weeks. And I really mean increased growth, not just marginally noticeable results. My nail growth was outpacing the longevity of my nail polish which I was pretty excited about it. The next thing I noticed was my hair was growing faster. I didn't measure but feel convinced that I experienced faster hair growth than I would have had I not been taking it. About 6-8 weeks into taking this collagen twice a day I noticed my lash growth was unreal. They were considerably longer and much fuller looking...other people noticed so it wasn't just wishful thinking on my part. Lastly, I have noticed right about the 3-month mark that my skin is definitely smoother. I would say I notice about a 30% decrease in the appearance of fine lines. I haven't made any changes to my skincare routine so I can safely attribute the change to the collagen. I can't speak to any digestive benefits as I didn't suffer from any issues prior to taking this product. I truly love taking this collagen and consider it an essential part of my daily routine. Highly recommend!

*EDIT 9/11/16* The last couple of months I thought I would drop down to just a single scoop serving per day and I feel that I can absolutely notice a difference in my results. My nails don't grow quite as quickly and even though my lashes still look nice, they are not quite as full looking as they were before. For me the most noticeable is my skin - it doesn't feel or look quite as plump and smooth which is a bit of a drag. Your mileage may vary, but for me I need to take this twice a day to get the results I want and to maintain them.

*EDIT 10/1/17* I have faithfully been using Vital Proteins collagen since I wrote the initial review. I switched over to their marine collagen formula because I had heard from a friend the type of collagen derived from fish scales is easier to absorb in the body. I couldn't really tell if the absorption was better but after several months on the marine collagen, I can say that I did not feel I saw the same results as I did with this product. Most noticeable is that I felt my hair growth returned to what it was before collagen and my lashes weren't nearly as long and full. Kind of disappointing to be honest. The marine formula is a good product but just doesn't work for me as well as this one does. It is also more expensive and doesn't last as long as a tub of this does. I am testing out plant-based collagen so I'll see what the results are with that the next little bit. If I go back to animal-derived collagen I know I will be coming right back to this product and I won't be experimenting anymore. This has still given me the best results to date.

*EDIT 12/30/18* While I really enjoy the plant-based collagen (and continue to use it) I've added this into my routine again and my results are next level and coming back so quickly, even though I haven't taken it for several months. And I'm only at 1 scoop a day so I'm excited to go back to a full serving! This is still my favorite collagen and I won't be experimenting with any others. I've found the best and plan on sticking with it!",positive
22,Health & Household,Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Powder,$21.56 - $98.99,5,"UPDATE August 23, 2021:
Still eating this stuff like a crazy person because it continues to work so well. I found the Mio and water combo wasn’t getting this down anymore so I switched to Jello :) I’ve tried several flavors and the cherry seems to hide the taste the best. I mix my jello per the box instructions for ➡️ Jigglers. I mix 2 large packets with 5 cups boiling water and throw all that into my mixing bowl and let the mixer do the work for me. Then I count out the desired amount of scoops into a smaller bowl and slowly pour that into the mixing bowl. I’ve added a picture of the finished product (minus today’s nibbles). Here’s the breakdown of scoops per box for me (again, I’m doing double what is recommended, but it seems to be working).

2-8.5 ounce boxes of jello
5 Cups boiling water - Do not add anymore water to this. It will be a consistency of something between jello jigglers and regular jello.
54 scoops of collagen
Mix with mixer until very well blended. The longer the better. I think I left mine going for 5 minutes or more.
Place in fridge to cool
~ I know that I need 2 ounces of Jello per day to get my 4 scoops in. If you don’t take that much per day than only scoop out 1 ounce. That would be the equivalent of 2 scoops of collagen. I finish it off with my big tumbler of water.

And if anyone is curious as to how I came up with this…
A few months back I started experimenting with jello and collagen. I needed a good measuring system to start with. I grabbed my baby food silicone molds (2 ounces per cup when full) and went from there. I have 3 of these molds so I tried out a few different methods. 2 scoops per 1 ounce seemed to work the best. When the jello is mixed with 5 cups of water it comes out to just about 54 ounces of liquid. Give or take a bit.

Hope this helps :)

UPDATE October 5, 2020:

After receiving and using my 2nd container for the last couple weeks I have noticed that this batch does not have the same smell or taste as the first container did. This container appears to have no taste or smell like the first container did. It also dissolves way more easily. I noticed other reviews that have mentioned similar differences and I’m just wondering if the quality control is just not there. This batch is still helping with my hair regrowth, but I am struggling to figure out why such a huge difference in the 2 containers. Still going to continue using it because it is helping so much. Just baffled at the differences between batches.
****************************************************

I started Vital Proteins a couple months ago after being at my wits end with postpartum hair loss. I was losing hair at an alarming rate. My hair girl was concerned about all the bald patches and thinning I was experiencing. We talked about different things I could try, but nothing seemed to help with regrowth. I simply was not seeing any regrowth at 6 month postpartum. Just more loss.

I had already been looking at this product and another one for a few months, but wasn’t completely sold on either one. I was skeptical. Then I found out that my nutritionist uses this product. At that moment I took the plunge and ordered my first container.

Within 1 week...gonna say this again...ONE WEEK, I had new hair growth!! I thought it was a fluke. I thought there was no possible way. So I stopped for a week and restarted the next week. Sure enough, in the week that I didn’t take any vital proteins the hair growth stopped. Once I started it back up the regrowth started growing again. I was still in shock over this. I finished my first container and ordered a second.

I now have 3 very distinct growth spurt layers and it looks like I have another new layer starting! My hair girl wanted to know what I had done because she in 5 weeks in between cuts, I not only had new crazy amounts of growth, but my bald patches were filling in. She wanted to know what I had done to get regrowth that fast. She is going to recommend this product to a few of her other clients that are experiencing the same postpartum hair loss.

Now, for the nuts and bolts of this stuff.

No. You will not receive a full container. It’s sold by weight, not volume. But taking 1 scoop a day it will last about 2 months. I take 2 scopes per day and it lasts about a month.

It claims to be odorless, colorless and tasteless. I am super sensitive to smells and tastes. I cannot stand the smell or taste of this stuff. However, I also take 2 scoops at a time per day. So mine is a little stronger. I think that’s why it’s working so well. However, if you notice in the picture I provided you will see how I get this stuff down. I use water and Mio. Makes this stuff taste like melted jello. It’s the only way I can take it. Even with this though I sometimes have a difficult time. But the results are totally worth it!!

It is sticky. It took me a time or 2 before I figured out that this stuff has serious sticky factor.

DO NOT SHAKE!!! The directions say to MIX well. Not shake. You shake this stuff up and you’re gonna end up with clumps. I use a whisk and mix it like you would jello. Mix it and you will not have any issues. Shake it or dump it too fast into the liquid and you will get clumps. It’s not rocket science.

Will I recommend this to every single person I know, YES! Absolutely yes!!",positive
23,Health & Household,Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Powder,$21.56 - $98.99,5,"I am so happy I decided to give Vital Proteins a try. I add it to my coffee every morning & cannot taste it at all. Some said they could even though it says unflavored. I use one scoop instead of 2 & am still getting results. I have been a nail biter my entire life. At the age of 70 my nails are now growing & I can see the wire part of my nail! I believe my hair is growing faster also. I have noticed a callus on the bottom of my foot from a Morton's Neuroma isn't as hard & thick as it was. I don't have any explanation for the change because it didn't happen until I Started using Vital Proteins. I have fibromyalgia & arthritis so I am still waiting to see how much my pain level changes. Time will tell. Someone said to be aware that it could cause constipation but it has been the opposite with me. I have always had problems in that area but was better after gastric bypass.

24,Health & Household,Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Powder,$21.56 - $98.99,5,I don’t use this product for pain but rather for hair and nail growth. I think it definitely helps with that and I am grateful for this. I need as much help as I can get with strengthening my my hair and nail growth. Due to certain health problems I especially have to do supplements for this help. This particular brand seems to help more than others. I put it in my morning coffee and it has no taste whatsoever. It dissolves quickly in the hot coffee. I urge you to try it if you need to supplement your daily diet to strengthen hair and nails. I have noted new hair coming in and that’s exciting. My nails are much better on one hand and doing some better on the other. I used artificial nails for years and only stopped during the pandemic. I have decided to not use them while I work to strengthen them.,positive
25,Health & Household,Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Powder,$21.56 - $98.99,5,"So I wanted to wait a while to write a review, this way I could speak about this products benefits.

I've been using this product for 3 months now - I started with the smaller sized container to get a good test run first. I do a lot of research on the products I put into my body, and this company checked out okay with what I had originially read. So quality, check.

My first opinion with this product was the taste - when added to tea, if taken as suggested (2 scoops) you can definitely tell there is a taste. It is a mild taste, but a taste nonetheless. But it dissolved right into the hot liquid without any problems, did not change the color of the tea at all.
So I decided to change my doseage - I put 1 scoop into coffee (no taste/no color change as I drink my coffee black) and then 1 scoop at night when I drink my post-workout (from another company). No further taste issues.

What changes have I experienced:
My hair is definitely growing quicker than before, but not incredibly speedy - so don't set yourself up for that expectation. My hair and nails are definitely stronger (which I needed after having a gel manicure twice a month for the last two years)
My skin - definite improvement. I still get blemishes, that's just how my chemistry goes, but I've definitely noticed a glow, not over-oily etc.
Also, I just overall feel better.

So, if you're like me and read every review before purchasing a product, I hope this review serves you well. If you're curious, but don't want to commit to the larger container, get the smaller size and give it a test-run. I saw benefits after one month, combined with a moderately healthy diet (and drink drink drink your water!!), and the only thing I changed about my routine is adding a scoop of this powder to my coffee/shake. If you do not choose this product, buyer beware - check ALL the labels before purchasing.

Cheers!",positive
26,Health & Household,Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Powder,$21.56 - $98.99,4,"Ok so this is my first time ever trying anything like this. I had my nails done a few months back, and it really took it's toll on the health of my nail beds. I noticed my hair thinning out too (Welcome to mid 40s) so I did my research and tried this.

1). First and foremost: This is truly tasteless! At first I could taste it, but that's because I was mentally telling myself I was trying something different. I mixed it in my morning coffee or my juice and truly, I can't taste it.
2). My nails are growing back faster and more healthier. I have had to trim them back twice in a month, and this is not my normal.
3). My hair stopped falling out with each shampooing I did. Now this took about 30 days to notice, however, I feel my hair is different and I am not complaining.
4). My skin feels a bit firmer, and not as blotchy.

My teenage daughter thought this was a soap product and added it to the washing machine...not sure if it made my clothes younger LOL! But I can say this product works.",positive
27,Health & Household,Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Powder,$21.56 - $98.99,5,"I have been very happy with this product - the first difference I felt after a few weeks was that it helped me sleep. It contains glycine and if you look online there is research that shows that helps with sleep. I sleep for longer periods and if I wake up at night I can fall back to sleep quickly which has made a big difference in my general well being. Then after about six weeks my knees started to feel better which I think was the collagen, and now after a few months my hair is more shiny - all good things!

It does have a taste - it isn't strong but I tried it with plain water and it needs some flavor to cover the taste. I don't want to add it to my coffee, and like drinking it cold. I found that flavored carbonated water like LaCroix is just enough to cover the taste, but it does not dissolve quickly in cold liquid. I was mixing it and leaving it sit on the counter until the lumps were gone, which could take as long as an hour. Some of the photos I have seen in the comments show lumps and I think they didn't let it sit long enough to dissolve.

I finally came up with a method to mix it quickly and I wanted to share it. What works for me is: (1) Pour a small amount of the cold flavored water into a glass - maybe 2 oz. (2) Put that in the microwave and heat it until it is hot - about 20 - 30 seconds. (3) Sprinkle two scoops of the Vital Proteins into the small amount of hot liquid and stir it until it dissolves. It will dissolve quickly without lumps when it is hot. (4) Pour in the rest of the cold flavored water in the glass with the already dissolved collagen solution and mix that. If I want it colder I put in an ice cube. This would work for any cold liquid, you could add juice as well. Basically, the idea is to dissolve the Vital Proteins in a small amount of hot liquid first and then add the cold liquid to that solution. Hope this is helpful!",positive
28,Health & Household,Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Powder,$21.56 - $98.99,5,"This does not alter the flavor of my coffee and dissolves quickly. No clumps!! I have a bad knee that the doctor told me years ago would need replacing. I limped along for years and was unable to squat without help getting up due to the pain. I have been using this product for nearly a year and I PROMISE that I could tell a difference in my knee within two weeks. The pain is gone and I can function without a limp. Squatting is still a problem because of my age, but I don't have pain when I squat and as long as I have something to hold onto I am able to get up on my own PAIN FREE! I wholeheartedly recommend this product! My nails and hair have also benefitted from having a scoop in my coffee every morning. Just get one container and try it. I promise you that you will also become a believer and continue to take advantage of the benefits it has to offer. Vital Proteins is AWESOME!!",positive
29,Health & Household,Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Powder,$21.56 - $98.99,5,"I have been adding the recommended 2 scoops to my morning beverage for over 5 months now and I honestly say it's made a difference. I read all the reviews on it and a lot of them are correct! There are some containers out there that look exactly the same without hyaluronic acid in it. It will say on the front and in the ingredients if it has it or not. Sadly, Costcos does not I found out. Because I really wanted hyaluronic acid, I have only used this one as a result and can't comment on the one that doesn't have it.

I'm almost 50 and have normal to dry skin. I'm getting those lines on my forehead that we tend to get as we age. Since I started this however, those have virtually gone. I've also noticed my skin doesn't feel so dry any more. Especially my elbows. I could cut people with my elbows because they were so dry and cracked all the time if I didnt keep lotion on them. Not anymore.

The product itself does have a smell if you are looking for it and it's not the best smell. You really have to be trying to smell it though to notice. Once you have added it to your drink however (I have only added it to drinks and not food) I can no longer smell it.

Taste is fine. I haven't noticed a big difference in the taste to matter to me. For those that are extremely attune to the taste of your coffee, you will notice a slight difference. Again, you will have to really be looking for it to notice. I add it to coffee or tea and not straight to water so I cant make a comment to how that would taste. It does slightly change the consistency of my coffee and makes it a little thicker because I use 2 scoops but nothing bothersome.

People are right about it not dissolving as well in cold fluids. I like cold coffee so what I have done is either start mixing as I'm adding it in or put it in a small amount of hot water first to dissolve it then add it to my cold coffee. If I'm stirring it straight in to cold coffee, it does leave lumps and sticks to the stirrer like sticky powdered creamer. I scrape off the stirrer and mash up the lumps and it still has lumps. It does eventually disolve however in cold beverages if you stir it or mix it up long enough. Way too long for my liking but that is the only thing I have noticed that bothers me. No issues though with warm or hot beverages. I recommend mixing it in instead of adding it first then the hot beverage on top as that will create lumps.

I haven't noticed any other benefits beyond my skin. No joint pain relief or anything else collagen may be said to fix.",positive

If you’re anything like me, you shop for the best deals or weekly sales. Often I’d realize oh yeah, I also need to add some paper towels to my pick up order. Problem was when I’d get my pickup/delivery the paper towel I ordered was always out of stock, mysteriously sold out that day, or substituted with some cheap crappy stuff that never got the job done.
Frustrated, I turned to Amazon for the answer!
Always in stock, plenty more than I need, and trusted quality!
Select-a-size is a great option for small jobs. Full size sheets are tough for all your day to day messes such as dealing with the aftermath of cat hair balls or kitchen clean up after kids, dogs, husbands/wifes.
Easy to grab and have a child looking to earn allowance drag in the house for you, or lightweight enough for you to kick in when your hand are full.

41,Health & Household,Amazon Brand - Presto! 308-Sheet Mega Roll Toilet Paper,$25.61 - $409.94,5,"We all need it and as far as I can tell, there is really no way to compare sizes. Big rolls, giant rolls, double rolls, triple rolls... who knows And sheet count does not seem to matter. Recently got some single ply, 1000 sheets per roll. The thinnest product I have ever seen, needed 50 sheets for what you use could use 5 sheets of a nice double ply normal brand. There is a difference in softness. Bought a case of ""office toilet paper"" one time. Still have some left over as everyone in my family knows it is like sandpaper, so they always grab the softer products.

I believe that Presto is an Amazon brand, never seen it in stores. The quality of this brand is good. Maybe not the softest or the strongest, but their toilet paper is good. When buying toilet paper, this is certainly a product I consider. As for price, seems to last about as long as any other roll in our house, and since it is impossible with all these roll sizes, seems to be a pretty good price Nice big box, delivered to your door, works great for us",positive

I ordered this TP during the height of the pandemic when I couldn't find any decent toilet paper in local shops. The stuff I found was like sandpaper on my delicate backside and I couldn't sit down right for days over it.

So, I ordered this and didn't expect much. I just needed something that didn't make me feel like I was scraping my bits with a butter knife. Imagine my suprise when this stuff arrives and it's not only soft ... it's durable and the rolls are thick and it doesn't cause itching or pain or dry rump. I love this TP. LOVE.

Now I'll be drowning in the stuff for at least a year, good thing I really like this stuff. it's really similar to Charmin but doesn't pill like Charmin now says they don't but I detest those bear commercials so much I will NEVER buy Charmin again. My friends and family are getting worried because I bought so many paper products on one day that it filled up all my extra closet space and I have 4 HUGE boxes of it in my study.

Oh a friend of mine that is covid jobless and getting assistance which doesn't cover TP was gifted one large box from me. She was so happy. I guess it gets very stressful with 3 girls in the house to be down to your last roll of TP and frantically looking under sofa cushions to find enough money to buy some more to get you to the end of the month. I'm now her ""supplier"" and just require hugs from her two little adorable girls as payment. Remember when COVID first started and stores were just emptied from TP so obviously a few people were hording a LOT snd may have been planning on charging $5 a roll or something - that was not me.

If you’re worried about contamination and/or returns, both Premier Protein and the FDA’s website list the products that have the possibility for concern that should be discarded.

The only flavors on the list are chocolate, vanilla and cafe latte. The only sizes of these flavors listed are the 11oz (the smaller rectangle boxes) in the 4, 12, 15 and 18 boxes. *This does not include the bottles or any of the other flavors.*

You can find the lot codes on both websites if you need to check what you’ve purchased. Premier protein’s Twitter and their website have a phone number available to call for more info or returns. They want to know where this is happening so it’s taken care of.

53,Health & Household,Premier Protein Shake,$23.99 - $75.00,5,"Do I love these protein shakes? Absolutely.
Are they genuinely delicious? Heck yes.
Are they harder to open than the Pope's legs? Yupperoo.

Let me take you on an epic journey. This is the tale of me fighting these shakes open every morning with no regrets, but fighting nonetheless. First, there's a plastic seal that needs to be torn, ripped, then peeled away. Now on a normal day, this wouldn't be a monumental task, but God help you if you have nail polish on. Even after drinking these for at least two years, I still struggle to force my polish-covered nail under the microbe of space between the seal and the cap. After multiple failed attempts, and coming to peace with the fact that I may have to sacrifice my beautiful nail in order to get to this low-sugar, protein-packed nectar of the Gods, it finally submits to me and tears.
Did you think we were done there? Nah fam. Just because you got that first tear doesn't mean the work is done. That plastic seal is more stubborn than a boomer whose coupon is expired. You'll need a couple more vigorous tugs to conquer the perky, red plastic.
But wait, there's more! Now you've gotten the seal off, and maybe half the wrapper on the bottle, another obstacle stands between you and shotgunning the protein-packed sweetness. You'll need to unscrew the cap (which is slightly more secure than the US Capitol) and peel off another seal! This one comes with three handy tabs, but if your fingers happen to be adult-sized, rather than toddler-sized, good luck gripping one of them. This is when I like to bust out the profanity to really jazz up my morning. The seal will succumb to you, usually with only a few prayers to Satan for strength. Then you're good to go! Enjoy that sweet, cool, delicious liquid breakfast. You earned it!
I usually opt to perform this sacred ritual while driving, because the odds of me not crashing my car are significantly higher than me waking up 5 minutes earlier to do all this before I leave for work.

Thankfully it is well worth it each and every day. Sometimes it's so much fun I do it a second time for lunch. Despite the daily battle to get the bottle open, it is worth it.

77,Health & Household,Amazon Basics Coin Cell Batteries,$4.42 - $9.99,4,"You literally have to carve these batteries out of the strong wrap and heavy cardboard with a sharp scissors circling the very edge of the batteries.

78,Health & Household,Amazon Basics Coin Cell Batteries,$4.42 - $9.99,5,"Since I use a lot of LR44 button cells I purchased this pack of Amazon Basics and 2 other brands to run a comparison test. I'll admit my test is not 100% conclusive as I only tested one cell of each brand at what I'll call a ""high drain"" test. Testing a larger number of samples at various levels of current drain might yield different results.

Most manufacturers consider a 1.5v battery to be ""dead"" when the voltage drops to 0.9 volts. I used a 150 ohm resistor as the load and set the tester to drain the battery until the voltage reached 1.0 volts. That means the initial current was about 10ma (milliamps) tapering off to 6.7ma, which is much more current than a calculator or kitchen timer would use, but about right for one of those strings of tiny LEDs used to decorate a holiday wreath. At this higher load the batteries lasted about 12 hours.

As you can see from the photo, the Amazon Basic tested as good or better than the name brand batteries and they cost less. But the Tenergy brand was almost as good, having 94% of the capacity at only 27% of the cost of the name brand button cells.",positive

perfectly in the glass break sensors. The batteries came charged and are working well. I hope the batteries
last a long time like a year or more, only had the bateries for a short time , so again i hope they last a long time.
I read other reviews that talked about 2 problems: batteries came dead, and also battery size.

82,Health & Household,Physician's CHOICE NUTRITIONAL_SUPPLEMENT,$19.97 - $29.97,5,"I am about to finish my first bottle and I must say it’s been pretty good. At the beginning I was hesitant from the negative reviews but I am glad It didn’t steer me in the wrong direction. I will say this judging by the reviews. If you have never taken fiber or a laxative in your life or a long time maybe start the process first with one of those. Anyone of those for the first time could loosen up something that could cause stomach pain, bloating, nausea and even fever when passing through your body. I take fiber daily so when I took this pill it almost felt as if nothing was happening. After a few days my acid reflux has diminished. 25 days in I have lost almost 15 pounds. My bloating and inflammation have almost disappeared. Now I won’t go as far as to only praise this product because I also combined the probiotics with a better diet, multi vitamin and more exercise so I’m sure it’s a combination of it all.",positive

My BM have also improved some.
If u suffer with any digestive health problems, plz research these.
The price is fair and the product is great.

84,Health & Household,Physician's CHOICE NUTRITIONAL_SUPPLEMENT,$19.97 - $29.97,5,"For at least a year or more, my sister has been trying to get me to take a probiotic every day. I was hesitant. I don’t like taking supplements and wasn’t sure about probiotics, so I tried yogurt first (didn’t help much) and started reading about probiotics, and decided to go with this brand. I am on my second bottle now, and I can honestly say it has changed my gut health for the better. Before taking, EVERYTHING I ate hurt my stomach. Spinach, garlic, dairy…..just made my stomach hurt. Not because these foods cause gas. That wasn’t the issue. They just caused a lot of pain in my stomach. Along with some foods causing a lot of acid reflux at night, now matter how long I waited after eating to lay down. Within 12 hours of taking my first pill I noticed my pain was gone. And any bloating I had was better, too. I also started to notice that my acid reflux was also improved. I couldn’t believe it! I now take one every day with my morning coffee. And if I skip one day, the benefits stick around for a day or two, but then my pain returns. I am amazed at how well this probiotic works. I have shared with friends and family how much I like it. I hope others here are encouraged to try it, based on my review.",positive
85,Health & Household,Physician's CHOICE NUTRITIONAL_SUPPLEMENT,$19.97 - $29.97,5,"I have tried SO many probiotics, from high end, celebrity endorsed ones like Seed, to low end ones found in Target. I have tried Garden of Life, which is endorsed by so many, and even pricey refrigerated probiotics. Of all of the ones that I have tried, this one works the best and is the one that I keep coming back to over and over again. I think I kept branching off and trying others because of FOMO and the fact that this is a really good probiotic at a price that doesn’t make my bank account cry, which sort of goes against the narrative that you have to pay more for quality. I do think the prebiotic blend they have in this is what boosts its results. Either way, I’m going to stop wasting money elsewhere and get back to bulk buying the heck out of this probiotic.

I’d also like to note that I tried this brand’s Women’s Probiotic, but it didn’t work like this one. There is something about this one in particular that ticks all of the boxes for me.",positive

91,Health & Household,Quest Nutrition Protein Bars,$19.99 - $78.89,4,"I have been getting this brand - Quest - for 6 months or so because of the amino acid profile and 20 grams of protein per bar. The double chocolate-chocolate chip flavor was always pretty good, but the bars in the last box I received were disgusting.

Too much L-methionine was added to the blend in these, lending a repulsive fishy taste and even worse aftertaste to the bars, one completely incompatible with chocolate or anything not complemented by the aroma of {dead} fish. I tried a couple of bites from 3 of the 11 remaining bars with the same results.

But flavor is only one potential problem. There is another issue consistent with all the flavors of this brand, and that is the packaging focus on the protein in these bars at the expense of the fiber, the amount of which isn't mentioned on the package face, only in the list of ingredients on the back, and the fiber content is never easy to find.

Unless you have IBS, are severely impacted or perpetually constipated from opioid use, for example, 14 grams of fiber (50% of RDA) is simply too much, particularly if you enjoy eating the bars like a snack, thinking you're getting all this good protein, not realizing that all that fiber will present issues you hadn't counted on.

If you're not suffering from something related to fiber deficiency, don't consume more than one bar per day. In fact, if you're just starting to consume protein bars - for the protein - you might want to consider a brand limited to 1 to 4 grams of fiber (four at most).

It didn't occur to me right away that these and a few other brands marketed as ""protein"" bars have four [4] to five [5] times the amount of fiber as a serving of Metamucil, but if you're reading this, you have been warned. If you're already having aforementioned ""excessive fiber consumption"" problems and didn't know what was/is causing them, now you do.

Amazon sells bars that contain what the package claims - always check the ingredients list - and you can also buy protein powder made with WHEY. Plant based protein products do not contain amino acid proteins in the proportions best for energy, muscle growth, prevention of muscle damage and pain, reducing the percentage of body fat, etc. If that's what you're looking for, search ""whey protein bars"" and ""whey protein powder"" and make cretain the label doesn't say ""plant based"" or ""seaweed"" or ""ocean"" proteins.",positive
92,Health & Household,Quest Nutrition Protein Bars,$19.99 - $78.89,4,"The first bar out of the box was a tad dry and crumbly, indicating that it wasn't that fresh, but the rest were fine. I ate that first one anyway, though, and it was still pretty dang yummy. I love the taste, and I NEED the protein (not a big meat eater). Quest bars are sold individually in stores, but they're way more expensive than ordering by the box from Amazon. The flavor and chewy texture are very satisfying. I have quite a sweet tooth, but cannot have sugar, and this product does it for me. However, my daughter says she doesn't care for it, so there's that. I guess it's not for everyone, but I'm glad I found this flavor of Quest bars. I do NOT care for the other flavors.",positive

I then eat the other bar after dinner (which for me is usually a lean piece of fish and some veggies) and I top the bar with low-carb ice cream. I love heating the bar up in the microwave for 30 seconds first, and then putting the ice cream on top; it's heavenly!

I've been this way for over 30 years, and until recently it wasn't a problem. After getting COVID, I was pushing even more water, and my doctor believed that I was flushing my system too much.

So now I fill my 40 oz water vessel of choice my usual 5 times daily but one of them has a packet of Liquid IV.

Seems to have helped quite a bit. I prefer this over the bottles of sports drinks and this flavor is pretty benign with 40 oz, I've tried it with less (24 oz), and its flavor is a bit overpowering. I suggest this over spending a ton on the other sports drinks / electrolyte drinks. It costs less and doesn't take up a ton of space.

As far as other flavors. I've tried grape, and it wasn't my thing, if you like grape kool-aid you might enjoy it. Strawberry is a bit better but still tastes like kool-aid and the scent is a bit much.",positive

118,Health & Household,Liquid I.V. Hydration Multiplier - Lemon Lime - Hydration Powder Packets | Electrolyte Drink Mix | Easy Open Single-Serving Stick | Non-GMO,$16.85 - $244.50,5,"This product has changed my life I suffer from extreme dehydration and a need for increased salt due to POTS Syndrome. I have had to be hospitalized just to receive IV fluids due to the extreme dehydration that POTS can cause. I always carry a bottle of artisan water and have ever stocked up on Pedialyte and Gatorade yet nothing seemed to make a huge difference until this product. I went to a local health and fitness store and purchased some electrolyte powder to add to my water and that’s when I first saw these tiny packets. I purchased a few with my other electrolyte powder and left. After a few more hospital visits and stays I was quite unhappy about my lack of ability to keep my sodium intake up to stave off the low blood pressure and near fainting and dehydration. I didn’t want to get an IV port surgically implanted if I could keep from it as it had almost come to that due to finding my veins when dehydrated is so difficult for the hospital. I prayed, researched and prayed some more and that’s when I noticed I still had the packets of this product I had picked up to try at the local nutrition and fitness center I had visited months before. I thought, “Why not, the last electrolyte powder had helped a bit so what could it hurt to try another that promises more results?” I will admit I had no idea how much better this supplement would be than the one I was previously using. It was a true WOW moment!
LiquidIV is by far the best electrolyte supplement I have EVER tried! The lemon lime packets I had purchased months before shocked me not only at the amazing flavor but also how easy it was to mix in room temperature water with just adding them to my bottled water and giving it a few brisk shakes. I had no clumping like with the other electrolyte booster. I drank the bottle of water with this mix in it and within thirty minutes I started to feel more energetic, less shaky, and my dizziness was almost gone, for the first time in quite a few months I felt healthy again! “Was this product magic,” I thought?
It is a Godsend. I grabbed my laptop and went to Liquid IV’s website and read up everything I could, and not only do they explain everything that is in this wonderful supplement, but they had an entire page devoted to POTS SYNDROME! That to me was a sign from above so I sent out for half a months’ worth from the local retailer!
I have been enjoying and taking this whenever I feel weak or my blood pressure drops too low and I am feeling faint or exhausted for months now. Gone are the days and nights of ER and hospital trips for dehydration and low sodium! I can go out or invite family and friends over and know I will have a far less chance of fainting and I also can let go of the terrible feeling of shaking as much as I used to when very dehydrated. I even told my Cardiologist about this and how much it has helped me and gave a packet of it to his team to try. He said he loves this product and benefits and will tell his other patients with electrolyte and dehydration issues! This is far better than having to have a permanent IV port placed to give me IV fluids and I can take these anytime anywhere!
• Liquid IV’s customer service is amazing! I recently purchased a bag of the lemon-lime my favorite flavor here on Amazon due to my needing more and my local health store was out of stock at the time. When it arrived the bag and content may have been squished and were damaged. This was most likely due to our postal carrier as we have been having issues with them not handling persons packages with the care they deserve. When I contacted Liquid IV here on Amazon they refunded me asap and even told me I can purchase direct from their website for a discount!
This “IV” is actually something you will look forward to and not dread because there are no needles, no tubing, and no hospital trips just amazing flavor and hydration!

In the short 2-month period that she has been staying with me, we had to take her to the ER three times because she was getting constipated. Because of her digestive issue, it is absolutely a must that she has a movement every day. She cannot afford to get ""backed up"". We realized the issue was that she gets dehydrated because she cannot drink enough water on her own to keep her properly hydrated. She was literally going back to the hospital every 12 to 14 days for 2 months. The only thing they did differently was give her an IV. All of her meds were the same. I came across this Liquid IV. Gave it a try, one pack a day in 16 ounces of water, and she has not had any more issues with keeping hydrated. She also has regular movements every day. This Liquid IV is worth a try. Thank you, Jesus! She's had both the lemon-lime and the Acai. Lemon-Lime is her preference.",positive

The other options were the neck sling, which looks totally effective but something about hanging my head by the door urks me...and a vertical table, which I've used and LOVE but its extra af (meaning I don't have space for that crazy contraption maybe when I'm 50). Most importantly, I needed something portable.

Man, am I happy this lil futuristic tsunami pillow exists (not it's real name, I give it nicknames cus it's just so cute and weird lookin!) I'll have to travel with it and have one in my life forever from here on out but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make...

What does it do for me/how do I use it?
• it alleviates my neck, shoulder, and even lower back pain in a matter of 10-30 minutes.
• At a minimum, I use it two times a week for 5-10 minutes (but usually longer if I have time) and just lay on the floor with it tucked under my neck and the base of it pressed into my shoulders. You take deep, thoughtful breaths and let your head drop back. As you breath you'll feel your neck making space for the tension to pass through and be relieved. Make sure you're not tensing your shoulders, you will and that's ok, just catch yourself and really let yourself continue to fall into the stretch. BREATHING THROUGH THE TENSION IS THE MEDICINE. This pillow guides your spinal chord into alignment. Also pay attention to your how even your hips/pelvis will need to realign as you lay there.
• this alone permits me to go to town as a side sleeper.
• being that I'm a side sleeper with double jointed shoulders that pop out of socket when I sleep, as well as a lower back disk herniation---for years, on the daily, I've woken up with the most intense aches in my scapula, neck, and lower back. Its worse on weekdays when I work on a laptop and tilt my neck in a dumb way, but this pillow completely eradicated that pain in about 3 days after purchase. So we can all agree, IM OBSESSED.
• if I don't use it weekly, my pain will return as my work habits and phone habits seem to force me into terrible posture :/

If my experience sounds like yours in any way, I highly recommend you try this product! It will change your sleep, spine and body for the better.",positive
122,Health & Household,"Neck and Shoulder Relaxer, Cervical Traction Device for TMJ Pain Relief and Cervical Spine Alignment, Chiropractic Pillow, Neck Stretcher",$19.54,5,"I was skeptical… really, really skeptical. But I was pleasantly surprised how effective this thing is. I don’t have back or neck pain. I actually developed horrible carpal tunnel with my first pregnancy (both arms were numb up to my elbows with shooting pains, for months) and after that although my arms were no longer numb all the time, they were going numb while i was asleep and would often wake me up multiple times per night felling like my arms would fall off. They’d also go numb when i vacuum or mow the lawn.
So i started looking for help… After some research I realized that my numbness my be coming from my neck not my carpal tunnel.
An ad popped up for this and I read reviews (none mentioned my specific issue) but I decided to try it. After just one use I noticed a difference. And I started using it 2-3 times per day. After 2 weeks I was nolonger getting numbness at night or while vacuuming/ mowing the grass. I am so impressed… I don’t use it everyday any longer but i do it when i remember (2-3 times per week for 10min). So if you have a similar issue, give if a try. It really works.",positive
123,Health & Household,"Neck and Shoulder Relaxer, Cervical Traction Device for TMJ Pain Relief and Cervical Spine Alignment, Chiropractic Pillow, Neck Stretcher",$19.54,5,"I have always had terrible posture, made worse by working on a computer every day and my shoulders have been rolled forward as long as I can remember. Even when I try to roll them back, they're too far gone at this point and I am highkey worried about becoming an actual hunchback as I get older.

I used this neck/shoulder relaxer for the first time yesterday and I CANNOT BELIEVE the difference. I started with 10 minutes with it facing the ""Convex"" direction to try it out. When the timer went off, I sat up and felt INSANELY relaxed. It was like all that tension I had stored over the years had finally loosened up. Don't get me wrong, it was NOT a comfortable ten minutes. I had to consciously focus on breathing into the areas that felt pain. It's like a foam roller where it has to get worse before it gets better.

I then set a timer for 10 minutes to the ""Concave"" direction. This was the weirdest sensation. I had noticed a lot of pain in my shoulders during that process and when I sat up, my arms and hands felt numb and tingly and I couldn't lift my right arm above my head. While my neck and shoulders felt great, I was super scared that I had done damage and ran to the reviews to see if anyone else felt this way. After about 20 minutes, the numbness went away and my mobility completely returned. I could move my shoulders back completely, more so than before and could stand up straighter than I have in years. I think my body has been out of alignment for so long that it went into shock after being stretched back into place. I feel like a human noodle.

I plan to use this for 10 minutes 2-3 times per day for the next few weeks and then on an as-needed basis. After I stretch out, I put on a posture support brace while I work to try to maintain my posture. I almost never review products, but seriously, if you are concerned about rolled shoulders -- give this a try. I have tried to crack my back in every possible way to loosen things up and this is the only thing that has ever worked for me.",positive
124,Health & Household,"Neck and Shoulder Relaxer, Cervical Traction Device for TMJ Pain Relief and Cervical Spine Alignment, Chiropractic Pillow, Neck Stretcher",$19.54,5,"I’ve had tics since I was a little girl. Not the ones that cause Lyme disease, the muscle spasm disorder. Which means I’ve been using my body in ways that are totally abnormal and cause major problems. It’s been 20 years now that my body has been attacking my muscles. I would thrash my neck forward so hard I would nearly pass out and still do sometimes under stress. Though it’s less now that I’ve had them for 20 years and have somewhat learned to control them the after affects have been awful. My doctors told me I could slip a disc so bad in my neck that I paralyze myself if I continue and that my body pain is that of an aged adult nearing their 60s. I’m 29. I’ve learned to control them as best as I can but I now have chronic back pain and ended up with military neck from it. I have so much pain from abusing my neck uncontrollably. It scares me sometimes. I have done acupuncture and chiro visits that always have helped but sometimes I can’t afford those and I feel helpless toward the constant pain. I don’t even want to imagine how I’ll feel at 40. I bought this as a last ditch effort to find relief from the stiffness and pain. I laid on it for 3 minutes and immediately felt scared my head would pop off. It was uncomfortable in the best kind of way. It was as though blood was flowing, muscles were stretching and bones were falling back into place. The exhaustion I felt after just 3 minutes was enough to have to roll off. I felt crunching so I took my time because again it felt weird to feel this relief.. I’ve now used it 2 more times today since trying it earlier because my neck keeps yelling “put me back on that thing!” I already feel like my posture is better and that I have a tool to combat my straight neck. I’m excited to continue and see how this helps in the long run.

If you have chronic pain, it’s $25 bucks. It’s a great self help tool- it might be a little uncomfortable but it’s because your neck isn’t used to it- just like mine. I just tell myself this is safe, I am ok, this is helping me and after I feel amazing- and it’s only my first day of using. Give it a go!",positive

I usually have tight shoulders and tight lower back and hips, and I’ve been trying to find things to help with that and correct my posture for a long time. I used this on my neck first and really felt that cervical spine stretch. It felt so good to be able to lay my head back with neck support. Then I turned it the other way and laid on it under my lower back and WOW. It was uncomfortable at first, but I just did some deep breathing until I could finally relax. This thing gave a great stretch on my lumbar spine and I felt it opened up my hips and readjusted them better then just going to the chiropractor. After I was done with this, I felt I was standing and walking more upright then I have in a long time. My hips felt stabilized and my spine felt lengthened. I was breathing better and my lumbar spine had a nice curve to it like it’s supposed to. I plan to use this every day now for at least a few minutes to release tension after I get home from work.

But then I decided to try the Amazon brand presto paper towels when the sparkle ones were out once. I am so glad I did. I love them. I still like the sparkle ones as well and they are neck and neck as far as price per roll goes i THINK (once you take into account the small was really big rolls are really mega rolls) but I haven’t really done a thorough analysis on absorbency versus the number of sheets in a roll versus the price etc. but I am on a case of presto right now and they are so thick and a roll lasts forever and when you have rescue dogs that are having accidents in the laundry room & a single roll of paper towels goes a long way says a lot. But I also have the same memory of my sparkle paper towels as well. So I have alternating cases coming every month or every other month until I can decide. It’s so far I think the price is pretty equal for what you get and right now since I’m on the presto towels themselves they seem softer and just so thick and absorbent I’m very happy with them. Just thinking back it does seem like the sparkle towels have more sheets on the roll but the prestos are thicker so now I’m wondering if I’m gonna make myself go pull out two rolls to test them on a Sunday afternoon! Surely I can think of something better to do! LOL

BOTTOM LINE: Great paper towels, great value, fabulous absorbency! Definitely get them on subscribe and save.
Oh and one thing I wanted to mention, I typically do not like select a size paper towels at all however for some reason these are different. Maybe because they’re thicker when you go to tear your sheet it doesn’t feel like you’re tearing just a half a sheet you’re actually mindful of what you’re grabbing if that makes sense.

171,Health & Household,Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder,$24.99 - $199.99,5,"Just a heads up: If you're looking for a weight loss supplement / a meal replacer, this is NOT the product for you! This supports weight gain, look into regular protein shakes if that's what you're looking for instead.

Read the side of the container as well: Settlement causes it to look like there's less in the container than there really is. Weighed the container, and I got roughly 2lbs as mentioned, despite it looking half empty.

Now, onto the review itself!

As other reviews were mentioning, make sure the expiration date is on the bottom and NOT the side, otherwise it's not an authentic product and will probably taste like crap. Check the ""scoops"" that come with the product too (You really have to dig around with a spoon to find it).

As for mine, I received an authentic product with 0 problems.

So I don't have a blender or shaker.. YET. I mixed this with a spoon, and let me tell you it worked out pretty well! It still has chunks, so if you don't have a shaker or a blender yet, definitely accept this fate lol. I'd recommend purchasing a shaker! Amazon has some that are roughly $10.

I know stuff like this isn't supposed to taste too great, but WOW this surprised me. I didn't want vanilla or chocolate because I'm getting very tired of those flavors and wanted to try something new. Pick something you'll be comfortable with for about a month or two. I read another review saying it tastes exactly like a banana laffy taffy and wanted to test this, and is absolutely does. If you just chucked a bunch of banana laffy taffies and blended them in milk, that's exactly what it tastes like.

So that being said, it's a VERY strong artificial banana flavor, mildly sweet- but not overwhelmingly sweet. Genuinely, you can't even tell this is a protein supplement, and that's all I care about.

I will be buying more of these in the future and trying out the other flavors, but overall I'd give this a solid 7/10. I'm not a banana guy myself, so I wasn't expecting to love this at the start.

Blew my expectations though. I'd love to try the cookies and cream one some day.",positive
172,Health & Household,Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder,$24.99 - $199.99,5,"As a fitness enthusiast and a Science guy, I am always curious to find the real value of a supplement. What works and what does not work. More importantly, I believe the analysis of a product should be based on strong scientific knowledge base, combined with good old fashion practical use of the product, and only then one should come down to the final conclusion.

This product review and analysis was conducted based on 3 parameters

A. Constituents: What comes in the box, the real value of the product
B. Assimilation: How does this product goes down in your system, how much of it will your body assimilate
C. Usability : Long term usability and and effects.

I believe this is one of the best supplements available in the market today. The Question is Why?

1. The Quality of protein. Since its manufactured by Glanbia (who owns Optimum nutrition), this product is coming straight from the manufacturer. This is a BIG factor, 90% of the protein supplement companies source their raw materials from third parties, often importing them from third world countries.

100 grams of Whey protein isolate from one source is NOT equal to the 100 gram Whey protein isolate from another. Inferior resources usually have high level of Heavy metals and cattle Hormones. This has been elucidated from recent tests and published widely in the consumer reports. ON aced this report with minimum levels of such harmful residues. Reason is simple, they make their own whey in a plant which has to abide all regulations under US law.

Just for the point of reference. I am from India, and therefore know first hand how many poorly regulated cheese plants export their whey to Europe and US. So make sure your Whey protein is coming from Whey extracted in the US!!

The Additives

2. Ideally, I will prefer the protein powder with no artificial sweetener. But lets face it, such a product will be hard to sell. However, Golds whey keep artificial sweeter to minimum. If you check Bodybuilding.com forums, lots of consumer complain that its not sweet enough. I request all such folks to realise that is actually good for them, if you feel this product is not sufficiently sweet for you. Its better you use lesser amount of hydrant (Milk, water, juice etc), or add a tiny bit of Honey.

The Profile- The Myth about Isolate vs a Blend

3. This might be hard for some people to digest. However, the truth is 96% people who use Whey supplements, will have no additional benefits of taking an Isolate vs a Blend. Please note, when I use the word blend, I mean a product lile Golds whey which is well balanced with Whey isolate and Whey Concentrate. (not any junk product form the market). If you take the blend, you might get 1 gram of extra fat or 2 grams of extra carbs which is absolutely nothing. You can burn this by adding 1.5 minute to your jog routine or walking for 2-3 minutes. You will get the same result and effect as the Isolate, so its not worth spending extra refined Isolate. The Isolate rumor is just a Hype created by the supplement industry. I will repeat this again, if your blend is as good as Golds whey i.e you are getting 24 grams per 30 gram scoop, you don't need an Isolate.

Who all comprise the 4% population who can benefit from an Isolate. First people who are extremely lactose Intolerant. I have used the word extremely since all good products add enzymes to digest the little amount of lactose residue in the supplement. Lactose is not a a bad thing, its simply the milk sugar. So if you are highly allergic to Lactose, Isolate will help (they have negligible levels of lactose)

Second tier of people who can benefit from Isolates are professional athletes who are pepping up for an upcoming competition. This competitive set is consuming 5-8+ scoops of Whey protein daily and therefore will benefit from reduction in additional fat or carbs.

4. Why go for Whey protein blend when you have specialized protein powders with Whey,egg and Casein.

Its simple science, Whey is just better with the best Biological value*. This means that your body will better absorb and use the protein source from Whey more than any other source, therefore no wastage. Egg is also a great resource, which is just behind Whey. However in real world it lags behind Whey substantially, even the delayed absorption rate cannot compensate much. Scientifically it has been proven that Whey is just better, since it doesn't tax your digestive processes as much as an egg protein.

Question of Casein:
Its true that Casein has an edge when it comes to delayed absorption. Its anti-catabolic properties and slow absorption makes it an ideal night time protein. This said, its best when you take Casein in concentrated from, i.e. if you need Casein, take only Caesin, do not mix it with Whey... Why do I say this, Its a big topic based on metabolism response(will add a different thread later). One last thing 24 grams of Whey protein is NOT equal to 24 grams of Casein as the Biological value of Casein is lower than Whey.However Caesin does have its own benifit of delayed response, provided you actually need it.

*Biological Value: Biological value (BV) is a measure of the proportion of absorbed protein from a food which becomes incorporated into the proteins of the organism's body.

Whey protein concentrate: 104
Whole egg: 100
Cow milk: 91
Beef: 80
Casein: 77
Soy: 74

Last Thoughts:
Always keep a note of how much protein you are consuming from Supplements Vs straight from the food. Ideally one should keep protein sources from supplements under 25%, but if your life style is demanding and you are unable to get hold of good meals rich in protein, you should always keep your protein dependency under 50%. In layman terms, for most of us who are looking for fitness, keep it not more than 2 scoops/day. For those who really pump some heavy Iron keep it upto than 3 scoops/day. (let me know if you wish to know the science behind this)

In the end Supplements are only Supplements. The word Supplement has a lot of Drama attached to it, as if, if you don't take a protein shake within 30 minutes of your work out.. you will never make good gain. Total Crap. This is not a make or break factor(its just beneficial). Baring few exceptions. Supplements adds up only 20 percent of your fitness equation.",positive
173,Health & Household,Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder,$24.99 - $199.99,5,"Good blending protein. I’ve been using it in various flavors for years. The main reason I stick with optimum nutrition is it seems to blend better then other brands I’ve tried. I know some people have mixed reviews on the flavors but they are fine for me I usually stick with vanilla type flavors since they go better with other ingredients I once in a while add in (frozen fruits, Greek yogurt, etc) with a blender. If you are just using milk or water in a shaker cup or blends pretty easy and it’s a reputable company. Many other great companies too so shop around and find what’s right for you but I love this stuff.",positive

For those of you who have not read or seen any of my reviews, I am Certified Master Trainer for over 20 years & I have many certifications, one of which is a certification in supplementation, so because of my years of knowledge and dedication in helping people achieve healthier lives through exercise & nutrition, is the reason why I do these reviews... in hopes I can help someone, even if that is just one.

• As you would guess, I use Whey Protein Isolate every single day (sometimes 2x’ per day) & this  Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Banana Cream, 5 Pound  is hands down the best Protein brand on planet earth. Because of that, unless I am offered to review/test a new brand, I ALWAYS buy this.

• So you want to know why Whey Protein more specifically, Whey Isolate is extremely important, should you be using it &/or is this a good product? Well let me break this down a bit in hopes I can teach you something you may not have known and help you with your buying decision.

————————————————————— Product Information: —————————————————————
• Whey Isolate - it's important to realize that not all forms of whey protein powder are created equally. Whey protein isolate is the most complete forms of protein because it contains the greatest protein concentration coming in at 90-95%, while the rest of the whey protein powders range from 25-89% total protein content. Isolate contains the lowest level of lactose, so perfect for anyone that is lactose intolerant. Benefits of Whey Protein include: helps support a healthy immune system, supports heart health, helps with maintaining a healthy body weight & composition, promotes muscle growth, loss of body fat, reduces the risk for breast cancer in women, helps control blood glucose levels & helps prevent muscle & bone loss older adults. Whey Protein, more specifically Whey Isolate is extremely important, for those reasons. Remember that protein is the building blocks of muscle. If you are dieting or looking to bulk up, Whey protein is your best friend because it provides your body with all of the amino acids it needs to promote ideal health results from workout/training, it's low in calories, carbohydrates, fats, cholesterol & very convenient. The more protein you eat the more muscle & if you are dieting you will be able to keep more muscle.

—————————---------———————————— PROS: ———-----————————————————————
• Glanbia is a global nutrition company with their own farms and supplies MANY protein companies, BUT OWNS Optimum Nutrition. So why buy from a secondary source when you can buy right direct from the #1 source & that my Amazon Family makes them the best for a reason!

• This is Whey Protein Blend with Isolate being more abundant.

• My favorite flavor is Banana Cream & taste unbelievably good.

• I always make my shakes in a blender so mixability isn’t an issue for me but I assure you that even in just a shaker cup the mixablity is phenomenal, which leads me to my next pro..

• This is absolutely 100% instantized!

• Has Digestive Enzymes which is extremely important for me. I have been using this for many years now & never once has my stomach been all jerked up, so another thing i can assure you is true.

• This is Ultra-Filtered & any top of the line Whey would make sure the Whey is carefully micro-filtered or Ultra-Filtered to remove any harmful bacteria. The Whey will pass through a special micro-filter & immediately after, bacteria & spores are separated. This process also separates any denatured (altered/cooked) whey proteins from undenatured proteins so that the result is a high quality whey protein rich in alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin (two special proteins found in whey that have immunological benefits) and low in fat. Un-denatured whey proteins obtained in this manner also have better solubility, which means it dissolves easily in any fluid added to it.

• Optimum Nutrition list down the breakdown of their entire Amino Acid profile! That my Amazon Family is excellent!

• This has approximately 28g of Amino Acids which if you did not know, is a pretty healthy amount. Many won't list it because
1) it is embarrassing low or
2) They have something to hide.

• Did I mention that this has approximately 5g of Glutamine. Many Whey Proteins do not add any.

• I always buy the 5lb jug & the cost $57.99 is an exceptional price, in fact, many lessor Brands of Whey cost more!

• Only 2g of sugar & 4g of carbs per scoop. Not sure where that sugar comes from because I read the “other ingredients” and don’t see it. Uses Sucralose, unless the sugar is coming from the “Natural flavor”.

• 24g of protein per scoop which is more than most brands.

• Has more flavors than ANY company on the planet, so you will never get bored!

————————————————————— CONS: —————————————————————
• NONE!!!!!!!
—————————————---———————-— Final Thoughts: ——————--———————————--————
• So this is the ONLY protein brand I spend my hard earned money on & will ever! This is my honest & professional review & I was not given anything in return! I paid full price for this & worth every cent!
I been buying this for many many many years.

—————————————---———————-— Personal Note: —————————————---———————-—
• Buying a respectable brand is actually extremely important because many companies are selling a container of Whey Protein Concentrate as isolate & unless you ran a analysis on it or really know your proteins, you probably wouldn't even know you were using a cheap form of WPC until you started gaining body fat, started feeling bloated, getting gas, etc., and not getting the results you wanted from using this stuff. You would be surprised at how many companies do this! I 100% recommend  Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Banana Cream, 5 Pound !!",positive

CONS:
-Lack of softness
I think the product lacking softness actually improves it. Otherwise, I think you might experience it shedding or falling apart more often.

191,Health & Household,"Probiotics for Women & Prebiotics, 50 Billion CFU for Women’s Daily Digestive Vaginal & Immune Health",$27.00 - $54.99,5,"It does exactly what it says. I researched what, when, where, how, why, and if I should I take Probiotics. I found that the minimum requirements for effectiveness is 50 billion and a minimum of 11 strains. A lot of products claim to meet those two guidelines. But when you look at the ingredients they have a list of stuff that has nothing to do do with Probiotics bottom line. A lot of scams out there with products claiming to be the real thing but they are full of herbs, vegetables, and other ingredients that are known only to them. If you want all those ingredients buy over the counter vitamins, which might be a lot cheaper. But you and me are looking at Probiotics for a reason. Remember to stay focused on that particular reason.

I carefully compiled a list of over 125 products. Some had a few details on the ingredients and some had none. Yet, they all claimed to be Probiotics, which I quickly found out that it was not true. Anyway, if a particular product did not clearly list the required ingredients, I crossed it out from the list. Every product claims to be the best on the market. Don't fall for it. One product at the time was scratched from the list, until I found the right one for me and my medical issues.

I decided to buy Garden if Life Probiotic. I made this choice after pouring many hours on research, which needed to meet specific criteria: 50 billion and 16 strains. Anything less than 50 billion isn't that effective for reaching my medical goals (see them listed somewhere else in this post).
And of course, every ingredient that is contained in this product is clearly listed on the Amazon website. My doctor said that there was a lot of research on Probiotic products on neuroscience journals and how Probiotics could help me with my particular medical conditions, which the medical field had nothing else to to offer me. As a professional researcher, I had to get my hands, right away, on high quality journals on line. I read more than 15 articles from different journals. It took me a long time (over 2 weeks) because my cognitive difficulties (remembering, understanding, etc.). The research was well designed, the findings were consistent and they were well supported. If you feel the urgency to read research just go to Google and search for ""Probiotics research on neuroscience journals."" From there you get to pick and choose from a huge selection of journals. It's like a huge salad bar, with enough variety to satisfy anyone with an enormous hunger for information. It just doesn't get any better than that.

Note: Insurance companies do not cover this product. It really is a disappointment but not enough to discourage me give up on my search for a light at the end of the tunnel.

Next is affordability. Since my goal is to consistently take it every day for many years to come, I needed to to make sure it was affordable. This product is a winner!!! Since I'm on a fixed income, I need to make sure that I wouldn't go broke in the process of trying to reconnect with my cognitive abilities and, maybe even restore some of my memories. If nothing else, based on the research, I truly believe that I'll be able to improve my cognitive skills and keep new memories. And that, ladies and gentlemen, IS THE BOTTOM LINE. The simple FACT is that I have been taking this product for just a few days and I can SEE SOME ENCOURAGING RESULTS. I wrote this post (a) without any hand written notes on the side to rely on, (b) without taking me for ever, and (c) without sweeting bullets connected with the frustration of not having a clue whether I was making any sense. Let me give you an example of how I feel right now. This is, indeed, like you are watching the Super Bowl game and your team is getting its asses kicked, badly (my doctors lack of resources to help me). You almost lose hope (will I loose my mind completely? how soon? What will happen to me when I can no longer think nor remember simple words or conversations with my loved ones?), but you don't give up. You heart is full of faith thinking that something can be done to win the game. As hard as it is, and with very little hope someone makes the perfect play (my doctor studying Probiotics for years and recently recommending to patients who had similar problems like mine. According to my doctor he was getting encouraging results) and you come back from the brinck of despair. The last day of the season, on the last second you find yourself being a part of of the winning team. You feel like you were present in the stadium with your team players when you won the Super Bowl (my the help of Probiotics). And you feel like life is returning to you and your steps are lighter, quicker, easier, and you have all the confidence of the world. Life seems to be returning to your mind and the future looks full of new possibilities and new adventures. I CAN THINK, ENGAGE IN SIMPLE CONVERSATIONS WITHOUT GETTING LOST, AND THAT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING. I have faith that I am going to to have a great future. A future without fear. Please you all wish me good luck, and if you don't mind praying for a stranger pray that my new found hope on Probiotics really works.
Thank you for reading this long, mushy, and even corney post, but I am too excited. I just couldn't wait to share with the world. I hope others too can find new hope with this product. Nothing is guaranteed in this life. Not even Probiotics. It is just my own experience and nothing else.

Our 7 year old son tested off the charts for impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity in his ADHD evaluation and was diagnosed with severe ADHD in February of this year. He had struggled in school since kindergarten and received bad reports almost every single day from his teacher this year. He was frustrated because he couldn't control it, and we were distraught and all we wanted to was to do what was best for him. We wanted to help him so badly. I scrambled to find a doctor to set up and appointment with to discuss medication even though I am typically adverse to any medications for our family unless absolutely necessary and always seek natural methods first if possible. We were only a couple of weeks away from putting our son on ADHD pharmaceuticals. In a last ditch effort, I ordered Smarty Pants gummies and prayed with all my heart they would help. We also eliminated ALL artificial food dyes and began to eat as organic and clean as possible. After one week, we already noticed a difference. After 2 weeks, the difference was substantial. We went to his doctor appointment and she noticed such a difference that she was fully supportive of continuing our natural methods and even wrote a letter to support our decision to his school. The good reports started to come back from school and we are now almost 3 months in and we have only received a couple of semi-tough day reports. Overall his teacher has given us positive reports for weeks now and that has NEVER happened. His teacher even told us she no longer felt it necessary to have a support team meeting that they had arranged with several of his teachers and staff to strategize what to do next to help him because he has made so much improvement!!!! He still forgets from time to time and still needs redirection at times, but he was so bad before that he could barely even function and has now gone to fully succeeding and thriving! He is a completely different kid and we are eternally grateful for finding something that has completely changed our son's life and given him the ability to be the incredible kid he has always been.

I did see there were several other reviews with similar concerns. I was able to text message the actual Smarty Pants support to ask questions about why the sleep kids gummies look like this and if they were safe for consumption. This is the response I received from the company:

""Part of the production process includes drying the final gummies - and during the drying time the surface appearance of some gummies can be impacted more than others. This variance can occur in the same batch and also from batch to batch. There is no quality concern or safety risk from this appearance. We use a combination of herbal ingredients, including Saffron Extract, in SmartyPants Healthy Kids Sleep. Due to the nature of the saffron extract, there may be some natural color variance in the gummies. However, you can rest assured that this doesn't impact the purity, potency, and safety of the product, which are all tested for at a third-party lab. We are sorry for the concerns this has raised.""

When I went to order them, an offer came up that if I ordered 2, I’d get an additional % off the second one - even better, right?
The box came in 1 day (great!), and contained 2 bottles, I put one away for later and started opening the other, took off the safety wrap and was twisting the lid to take it off when I realized something wasn’t right, the jar felt funny, there was nothing moving within - I held it up and first impression was it had only been half filled, I could see a lot of daylight. Then I realized it must have been subjected to extreme heat, everything had melted into a blob at the bottom. You can see places where they were so “liquid” they slid down the side of the bottle and left residue. I retrieved the other bottle which was fine - full of separated, individual gummies. See pictures. In the “melted” bottle in some areas I could see partial outlines of some gummies - so I started working with the wrong end of a toothbrush to see if any could be separated. I have spent days/hours at this, and have “freed” about 2/3 of the mess, about 1/2 if those are roughly identifiable as what was once a gummy vitamin.
Obviously can’t return (and no way I’m paying to do that or spending any more effort on this). No way to know if anything from this bottle is safe to take/use - the heat it must have been subjected to had to be extreme, and extended? And even if they are safe, did the heat denature the vitamins? I’ve left bottles of gummies in our RV for weeks in the summer between camping trips in HOT weather and never had anything like this happen.

I moved to another city, and my local store didn’t sell the Puffs brand, so I began ordering them from Amazon. I thought I had ordered the Ultra Soft, but maybe I accidentally chose the basic Puffs, and I was disappointed with how scratchy they were.

281,Health & Household,"Tide PODS Laundry Detergent Soap Pods, Spring Meadow, 81 count",$21.24,5,"I have using Tide Pods for several years, now, since their arrival!!! What made me change from those big jugs of detergents, was their bulk, heaviness, and environmental impact! I believe in reducing my carbon, plastic, fossil, and consumerism. Because this Earth is all we have! One thing, that most are hearing in Tide commercials, is that you can use in COLD WATER!!! It IS true, that simple action, saved me from high water, gas, sewer,, electric costs, over the years,n the clothes, come out PERFECT! I am observant of my adding chemicals, into our water sources, too! With the big jugs I noticed, I used more detergents, rushing,or to remove stains. Now, I just ""open, pop, n go!"" A big convenient change in behavior n money spending! I keep my original pod container to store, in my laundry, and get the refill bags, to use! I only have purchased additional jugs, since the cost is low, with our post COVID-19 shipping and supply issues, I began bulking up, on necessities! I have tried other brands, and in my military travels, where uniforms must be spotless, I have used for 20 years,n NEVER any issue! I have used the ""spot cleaner,"" as needed, too! I have been and used Tide since, FOREVER, and have ALWAYS been impressed with the final outcome, even on moldy,or dirty bivouac gear! Buy this brand, you will be happy, too! When something works do not change it! Plus, Tide was one of the FIRST manufacturers to change their products' design and environmental impact! IF the company cares, I WILL support them.
