0,Movies & TV,Top Gun: Maverick,$24.96,5,"I saw this in Theaters 4 times. (2 times in IMAX, 2 times standard)
If you missed it there, find you a friend with an amazing home theater setup and FEEL the roar of these planes. (IMAX was AMAZING - you could feel the engines in your chest)

30 years after the original, a sequel no one expected and not many were asking for somehow manages to deliver everything that used to be good about theater experiences on a big screen.

With more attention to technical details and better dialogue, this movie is arguably better than the original, and considering the original is 'THE' quintessential 80's action film... that's no small feat.

Character development is fantastic, the action is intense, the cinematography is beattiful...and even though some of the music is not normally my cup of tea, I still find myself tapping feet along with it.

They even did diversity correctly. Nothing about it is ham-fisted or overbearing... the film simply shows you hard working professionals that happen to be male and female, of all shades and backgrounds.

There are very few technical flaws.
The original was a great film but there was a lot to criticize with regard to the flying sequences.
I can count the errors in this film on one hand.
This is a drastic improvement.

Again, I saw this 4 times in theaters.
Hollywood... if you want my money, I'll pay it.
Just follow this film's example and give the fans what they want.",positive
1,Movies & TV,Top Gun: Maverick,$24.96,5,"By far the best movie to come out in years, maybe decades. I'm a movie buff and a highly critical one, at that, but I loved EVERYTHING about this movie. Seriously.

If you want to see a true Hollywood, blockbuster, instant classic with real stakes, heroes worth rooting for, and (most importantly) GOOD VALUES, then look no further. Thank you to everyone who made this beautiful film for portraying American ideals and not pushing anything from any side of the political spectrum.

It's pure cinematic art that will not disappoint. Genuinely the best thing I've seen in years--went to see it three times in theaters just to experience it through a new audience all over again.",positive
2,Movies & TV,Top Gun: Maverick,$24.96,5,"Sequels often times do not live up to the original, especially one made 3 decades later. TGM is the rare example where the sequel was carefully crafted and expertly brings the audience back into the world of TG. Within the first 30 seconds of the intro credits, you are immediately treated to something that's familiar and nostalgic. The movie does a great job balancing the nostalgia and also moving the story forward. After all, Maverick is now 30 some odd years older and a lot has changed in the world since TG. The mark of a great film is one that resonates with the audience. TGM succeeds in that in almost every regard.",positive
3,Movies & TV,Top Gun: Maverick,$24.96,5,"Nostalgia in support of character re-introduction and new character introduction instead of fan service. The correct way to make a sequel.

20,Movies & TV,Jurassic World Dominion - Blu-ray + DVD + Digital,$24.96,5,"We saw this movie in the theater, and although we liked it, the movie wasn't great. Sure, there was lots of fun to be had with amazing special FX and people getting eaten by dinosaurs, but there were plot holes that detracted from the overall film. The new opening was a much better lead-in, and the rest of the additional minutes were put to good use answering a lot of questions we'd been left with after leaving the theater. I'm not sure what the reasoning was for not releasing this version in the first place. Fans would've easily sat through the additional 14 minutes, and I would've bought the blu-ray either way, as would most fans. Instead I'm left trying to erase the theatrical version from my brain so that I can fully enjoy the extended cut. Whatever you do, just don't watch the theatrical version first, or at all for that matter. This truly blows it away.",positive
21,Movies & TV,Jurassic World Dominion - Blu-ray + DVD + Digital,$24.96,5,I've been a Jurassic Park fan since the first movie was released in theaters. I felt this movie was a nice ending to the series and I'm happy they brought the original characters back. One thing that old fans of the series might enjoy is that there are some scenes referencing back to their older movies. I enjoyed the story line and felt that there was plenty of action. This movie is set years after the last one and there is actually a news clip that is part of the beginning of the movie to tell you what has happened in the world after the dinosaurs broke lose. I found it very interesting to see how dinosaurs and humans might coexist together. I really loved seeing some of the new dinosaurs they brought to the movie too,positive

But they kinda throw them in your Face at an astonishing Blink of an Eye Rate. Yes there are a Lot of Dinosaurs in this Movie and they are Fun to look at, if you don’t Blink much. Almost like Flipping Thru a Book with your Thumb as a break.
The Realism is slowly Very Obvious, because Hollywood doesn’t seem to pay much attention to Physics or Common Sense. I have to Laugh at how a full Grow Man can be lifted up onto another platform with a flip of the wrist from another Actor, and the list goes on and on . .

But in the End, it’s Really like a Grown Up Live Action Cartoon.

Tho the storyline wouldn’t be considered ‘Oscar’ material usually the movies that are bore me to tears, this one gets high marks from me for action and flat out entertainment value.

25,Movies & TV,Jurassic World Dominion - Blu-ray + DVD + Digital,$24.96,5,"I don't understand why people are hating on this if they like Jurassic World or any other sequels for that matter. It's suppose to be a bunch of pointless action, lots of dinosaurs, and yes a lot of cgi. The original characters are great in this film and Jurassic Park is my favorite film of all time. I've seen the original Jurassic Park probably over 200 times. I even worn out a VHS as a kid watching it almost daily.
To see the main cast reunited in Jurassic so many years later is something great. Also the wide array of dinosaurs is great to see. The extended version of the film is better than the theater version. It has a much better begining and ads a lot more script throughout the film with the main characters. The extra 13 minute footage shouldnt have been cut. That being all said, it's a mindless Jurassic World entertainment popcorn flick. I don't understand what else people were expecting.",positive

It has a long and extended cut of 2hrs 40 min but great. But if you weren't a fan of the first films, don't watch it or if you are looking for perfect scenes, and highly critical, stay away.

40,Movies & TV,1883: A Yellowstone Origin Story,$19.59,4,"The negative reviewers just want an action packed Western with lots of violence and blood. This series also has heart and gives the viewer insight as to what pioneer families went through with family loss and other hardships (disease, etc). So these negative reviews are from people who are addicted to an instant “rush” of violence and blood. If that’s their thing, I get it; we live in a world of people needing some kind of fix. I prefer living in a world where you watch a movie or series and let the story unfold over time—you know, like life.

The only thing that bugged me is the comparison of man to mere animals. We are NOT the same as animals and I have noticed this disturbing and Godless trend in many shows and movies lately in what I see as an attempt to spread an anti-Biblical narrative. If you can ignore that (most pioneers came from devout Christian backgrounds), you will enjoy the series. Word of caution though; there’s a bit too much modern-day vernacular cursing (lots of F bombs); also not realistic for that time period. But hey it’s TV. Sadly I guess the writers felt the need to give mainstream audiences something they could relate to in that way. Despite the flaws, it was still an enjoyable series.",positive
41,Movies & TV,1883: A Yellowstone Origin Story,$19.59,3,"This was an amazing adventure at first with lots of action and violence. It really slows down over time with much speculation and introspection by Elsa and not enough action IMO. If all ten episodes were like the first three easily 5 stars. But sadly it's not that way. The character of Elsa pretty much spoils a lot of later episodes. It's too bad too, because Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, and Sam Elliot all do an amazing job playing their roles. The actress who plays Elsa doesn't do a bad job either it's just a terrible character for a Western. It's like merging a modern coming of age teen character into a late 1800s Western.",fair
42,Movies & TV,1883: A Yellowstone Origin Story,$19.59,5,"Don't let the negative reviews sway you. 1883 is absolutely incredible. 3 Emmy nominations, including best cinematography and best score. The show perfectly balances the beauty and awe experienced in the American west with the downright horrid living conditions and reality of the late 1800's. Despite being a western, the story is completely original and undoubtedly tragic.

I'm not sure where the negative reviews are coming from; the show is slower paced than most modern movies/shows and is far from the popular superhero/MCU style of writing, but if anything this should be a positive as original quality content is far and few between. I suppose some aren't fans of sad stories, and if so than this show is definitely not for you because it's a tear-jerker. The historically inaccurate complaints are baseless; the show contains an incredibly accurate depiction of life in the late 1800's so much so that inconveniences of the day are a driving point in the plot.

This is a must-watch show of the decade. Stunning beyond belief from visual, audio, and strength of story standpoints. If it released on more than just Paramount, I think it would have had similar success to Yellowstone and Game of Thrones (before seasons 7-8).",positive
43,Movies & TV,1883: A Yellowstone Origin Story,$19.59,5,"I almost didn't watch because of the bad reviews and am so glad I didn't miss it. Because of the flashbacks in Yellowstone, I expected the show to be very different. When I realized it was going to be mostly a showcase for the young actress playing Elsa, I wasn't the least disappointed. She was lovely and the narration was perfect. I thought the production values around the action scenes were excellent. Those horses! The scene when she was playing the piano and the camera would cut to the battle taking place back at the camp. I wonder if Taylor Sheridan realized he wrote a young adult romance. I loved the 'heavenly' ending. I agree with one reviewer who said it would be helpful if we could give a thumbs up or down to some of these reviews. It is almost as if we have Russian trolls even on Amazon Prime Video. It's not as if this is the first storyline that developed a romantic relationship between a Native American and a settler. I am also tired of people who object to language. Really, I'm an old lady and I couldn't care less. Then there are the people who literally need to be a testament to their religion in a movie review. My goodness. I guess some people just have to go there. Anyway, I do have one complaint. I thought all of the acting was good. Tim, Faith, Sam...great job and with all others. The two young actors who played Elsa's lovers were great and Isabel was just wonderful. But the make up. What was that? Why was Faith made up to look so dark and both her and Tim's bushy eyebrows? They are both good looking people and the overdone makeup made them unattractive. The brief performance of the sister was also excellent. The Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson cameos were great fun. Billy Bob too. I loved binging this series. Elsa's narration was like a prose poem. I mean it. You really should do a book adaptation, Taylor. Btw, you seem to get better looking as you get wealthier. Not bad. You are becoming the second most famous Taylor. I love her too. Maybe her greatest oldest living fan. xo Jane",positive
44,Movies & TV,1883: A Yellowstone Origin Story,$19.59,5,"I cannot for the life of me fathom the criticisms of the people leaving one star reviews. This series very accurately portrayed the hardships of a westward journey by inexperienced pioneers and the many ways one could die in the west in those days. Contrary to my skepticism, Tim McGraw and faith hill did an excellent job of acting their parts in spite of not being professional actors. Sam Elliot added to the production with his iconic western tough guy persona.

The way in which this story was told through the eyes of an adventurous 18 year old girl was novel with the interjections of her narrations at key points. The dialog was quite poetic and enthralling and encompassed the adventure of a westward journey accurately and eloquently.

This series reminded me a lot of lonesome dove mixed with dances with wolves. A cattle drive from Texas to Montana with trials and tribulations along the way. Led by hard core cowboys - including a black character - everything that could kill or maim you was encountered along the way. And the sheer brutality of those life or death situations was an uncensored version of what it must have been like. Lonesome dove had that as well but this was was a more R rated version of the same storyline.

I would call 1883 an epic tale with outstanding narration and panoramic cinematography and a well put together storyline acted by an excellent cast.

I’ve watched it at least 3 times through and will watch it again in the future. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes westerns.",positive
45,Movies & TV,1883: A Yellowstone Origin Story,$19.59,3,"If you want to be depressed while enjoying a gorgeous view and great cinematography, this is the series to watch. The one thing that came across was how strong the parents' love was for their children amidst an impossible situation. The acting was all good, the characters real on the screen. However, there were parts of the story that seemed historically inaccurate. For example, it was odd that God seemed to be missing for most of the episodes when the pioneers, by in large, were a group given to strong Biblical faith. This was more ""New Age"" in approach, and, in that respect, disappointing.",fair

47,Movies & TV,1883: A Yellowstone Origin Story,$19.59,5,This is how the real West was taken hold of and the acting is way above most series so 20% 1 star is so sick.

49,Movies & TV,1883: A Yellowstone Origin Story,$19.59,5,This is the history of how the Dutton family from the show Yellowstone ended up at where the current ranch they live in happened and the trails and tribulations of getting from Tennesse to Montana. It is just their history. It helps explain why John fights so hard to protect the ranch today. Great show just like Yellowstone. Can't wait for 1932 it will continue to present day.,positive
50,Movies & TV,Top Gun: Maverick,$29.96,5,"I saw this in Theaters 4 times. (2 times in IMAX, 2 times standard)
If you missed it there, find you a friend with an amazing home theater setup and FEEL the roar of these planes. (IMAX was AMAZING - you could feel the engines in your chest)

30 years after the original, a sequel no one expected and not many were asking for somehow manages to deliver everything that used to be good about theater experiences on a big screen.

With more attention to technical details and better dialogue, this movie is arguably better than the original, and considering the original is 'THE' quintessential 80's action film... that's no small feat.

Character development is fantastic, the action is intense, the cinematography is beattiful...and even though some of the music is not normally my cup of tea, I still find myself tapping feet along with it.

They even did diversity correctly. Nothing about it is ham-fisted or overbearing... the film simply shows you hard working professionals that happen to be male and female, of all shades and backgrounds.

There are very few technical flaws.
The original was a great film but there was a lot to criticize with regard to the flying sequences.
I can count the errors in this film on one hand.
This is a drastic improvement.

Again, I saw this 4 times in theaters.
Hollywood... if you want my money, I'll pay it.
Just follow this film's example and give the fans what they want.",positive
51,Movies & TV,Top Gun: Maverick,$29.96,5,"By far the best movie to come out in years, maybe decades. I'm a movie buff and a highly critical one, at that, but I loved EVERYTHING about this movie. Seriously.

If you want to see a true Hollywood, blockbuster, instant classic with real stakes, heroes worth rooting for, and (most importantly) GOOD VALUES, then look no further. Thank you to everyone who made this beautiful film for portraying American ideals and not pushing anything from any side of the political spectrum.

It's pure cinematic art that will not disappoint. Genuinely the best thing I've seen in years--went to see it three times in theaters just to experience it through a new audience all over again.",positive
52,Movies & TV,Top Gun: Maverick,$29.96,5,"Sequels often times do not live up to the original, especially one made 3 decades later. TGM is the rare example where the sequel was carefully crafted and expertly brings the audience back into the world of TG. Within the first 30 seconds of the intro credits, you are immediately treated to something that's familiar and nostalgic. The movie does a great job balancing the nostalgia and also moving the story forward. After all, Maverick is now 30 some odd years older and a lot has changed in the world since TG. The mark of a great film is one that resonates with the audience. TGM succeeds in that in almost every regard.",positive
53,Movies & TV,Top Gun: Maverick,$29.96,5,"Nostalgia in support of character re-introduction and new character introduction instead of fan service. The correct way to make a sequel. If only Disney cared enough about Marvel Phase 4 or Star Wars to continue those franchise the way this movie was made.

70,Movies & TV,Elvis,$19.99,5,"I am one (of many) who has supported the makers of this film for I have seen it at the theatre at least 4 times and now I have bought it so I can watch it to my heart's desire. It is entertaining and mesmerizing. Austin had me believing he was Elvis even though the first time I went to see the movie I was so very hesitant. I didn't think he looked at all like Elvis. Indeed I have seen impersonators who did a good job with the makeup, hair and had the right physique and facial features to look like Elvis but never have I seen anyone make me believe that who I was watching was Elvis! He was as good channeling Elvis as Val Kilmer was channeling Jim Morris in the movie, The Doors. As good as Rami Malek channeling Freddie Mercury in Bohemiam Rhapsody.
Austin was either possessed or he is a reincarnate.",positive
71,Movies & TV,Elvis,$19.99,5,"This multidimensional film about Elvis Presley explores new perspectives.
It leaps far beyond the chain of events that we've already seen in prior bio pics about this man. The actors tell the story of Elvis' evolution as an artist, within the context of the era's music business, American history and cultural climate. As viewers, we experience the black culture that enveloped Elvis' childhood and the R&B and gospel music that he embraced. We learn and feel how deeply these aspects influenced his spirit and style. Austin Butler *channels* Elvis. He effortlessly lures our empathy for those screaming girls in the audience filled with goose bumps and exhilaration, and, later, the agony of Elvis' grief-stricken moments. We all come to understand Elvis more deeply in some way, in both the familiar and also the lesser known aspects of him. Beautifully done.",positive
72,Movies & TV,Elvis,$19.99,4,"Elvis had a unique and sensational life and there was no need to sensationalize this story because Elvis’s story speaks for itself. All you have to do is pick and choose from his life and give his life and the story you’re telling focus. Baz, the director, did a great job of telling a story in Moulin Rouge. Here he completely misses the mark and gets in the way of the story of Elvis’s life with too much dazzle and too much narration and too little of Elvis’s real story. I still give it four stars because its Elvis and its impossible to make his life uninteresting - but this is a C movie.",positive
73,Movies & TV,Elvis,$19.99,5,"I haven't been this excited or inspired by a film in years! It's fantastically produced- everything from the directing, editing, costuming, cinematography, use of music... it's all great. But Austin Butler's performance is absolutely out of this world. He's utterly magnetic. I saw this multiple times in theaters and have now viewed it multiple times at home, and even despite the long runtime, it never drags. As someone who wasn't around while the man himself was alive, this movie felt like it transported me back in time to an Elvis concert and I never wanted it to end!",positive
74,Movies & TV,Elvis,$19.99,5,I was hesitant to like this because most Elvis movies and biopics go one way or another. This one is told by Colonel Tom so I was ready to hate it.

80,Movies & TV,Jurassic World Dominion - 4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital [4K UHD],$29.96,5,"We saw this movie in the theater, and although we liked it, the movie wasn't great. Sure, there was lots of fun to be had with amazing special FX and people getting eaten by dinosaurs, but there were plot holes that detracted from the overall film. The new opening was a much better lead-in, and the rest of the additional minutes were put to good use answering a lot of questions we'd been left with after leaving the theater. I'm not sure what the reasoning was for not releasing this version in the first place. Fans would've easily sat through the additional 14 minutes, and I would've bought the blu-ray either way, as would most fans. Instead I'm left trying to erase the theatrical version from my brain so that I can fully enjoy the extended cut. Whatever you do, just don't watch the theatrical version first, or at all for that matter. This truly blows it away.",positive
81,Movies & TV,Jurassic World Dominion - 4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital [4K UHD],$29.96,5,I've been a Jurassic Park fan since the first movie was released in theaters. I felt this movie was a nice ending to the series and I'm happy they brought the original characters back. One thing that old fans of the series might enjoy is that there are some scenes referencing back to their older movies. I enjoyed the story line and felt that there was plenty of action. This movie is set years after the last one and there is actually a news clip that is part of the beginning of the movie to tell you what has happened in the world after the dinosaurs broke lose. I found it very interesting to see how dinosaurs and humans might coexist together. I really loved seeing some of the new dinosaurs they brought to the movie too,positive
82,Movies & TV,Jurassic World Dominion - 4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital [4K UHD],$29.96,5,"I love to see Hollywoods take on the Incredible Thunder Lizards of the Past. But they kinda throw them in your Face at an astonishing Blink of an Eye Rate. Yes there are a Lot of Dinosaurs in this Movie and they are Fun to look at, if you don’t Blink much. Almost like Flipping Thru a Book with your Thumb as a break.
The Realism is slowly Very Obvious, because Hollywood doesn’t seem to pay much attention to Physics or Common Sense. I have to Laugh at how a full Grow Man can be lifted up onto another platform with a flip of the wrist from another Actor, and the list goes on and on . .

But in the End, it’s Really like a Grown Up Live Action Cartoon.

Tho the storyline wouldn’t be considered ‘Oscar’ material usually the movies that are bore me to tears, this one gets high marks from me for action and flat out entertainment value.

85,Movies & TV,Jurassic World Dominion - 4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital [4K UHD],$29.96,5,"I don't understand why people are hating on this if they like Jurassic World or any other sequels for that matter. It's suppose to be a bunch of pointless action, lots of dinosaurs, and yes a lot of cgi. The original characters are great in this film and Jurassic Park is my favorite film of all time. I've seen the original Jurassic Park probably over 200 times. I even worn out a VHS as a kid watching it almost daily.
To see the main cast reunited in Jurassic so many years later is something great. Also the wide array of dinosaurs is great to see. The extended version of the film is better than the theater version. It has a much better begining and ads a lot more script throughout the film with the main characters. The extra 13 minute footage shouldnt have been cut. That being all said, it's a mindless Jurassic World entertainment popcorn flick. I don't understand what else people were expecting.",positive
86,Movies & TV,Jurassic World Dominion - 4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital [4K UHD],$29.96,4,"The opening of the extended version is far better than the version released in the theaters (what a mistake to cut the drive-in movie scene). Wish there were less locusts/secret lab and more human encounters with the escaped dinosaurs from the previous film - so many possibilities Other added scenes enhanced the film. If the producers were keen on cuts to the length of the film, they should have cut the amber mine sequence (weak/ineffective). It was a joy to see the cast of the original Jurassic Park film reunited.

Could anybody tell us how to access the Extended Version? We just can’t find it! Also, unfortunately, even with 4K player and receiver, we did not enjoy the 4K version as much as the Blu ray in 3 D. 3D is just absolutely great. Perfect surround sound included.",positive

110,Movies & TV,Where the Crawdads Sing [DVD],$19.99,4,"When I reviewed ""Where the Crawdads Sing,"" for the Amazon Vine program, I remember praising the elegance of the prose but pointing out the implausibility of the plot: a young girl, abandoned by her family, raises herself in a shack in the marshes of North Carolina in the sixties and becomes, with minimal help, a celebrated natural history author/illustrator. Now the novel by Delia Owns comes to the big screen, and the results are satisfying.

Here British actress Daisy Edgar-Jones plays Kya, whose mother departs after getting belted once too often by her father, followed by her siblings, including her younger brother who advises her to run and hide if anything threatens her rural existence. Alas, Daisy has to feed herself, though apparently, there are no utility bills to fret about, after her dad takes off, too. She begins to sell mussels to the kindly local storekeeper and his wife (Sterling Macer Jr. and Michael Hyatt) and tries attending school, but due to the mockery, only goes one day. When she becomes a teenager, she catches the eye of Taylor John Smith with whom she begins a tentative friendship, as he tutors her in reading, and then eventual romance. While Daisy is content to stay in the marsh, painting, sketching and collecting feathers and shells, (and putting together a book to be published) Taylor intends to go away to college, though he’s temporarily hindered by lack of funds. After Taylor, comes Harris Dickinson, another local lad but one with perhaps less-than-honorable intentions. But when Harris is found dead apparently from a fall from a fire tower, Daisy is arrested under suspicion of murder. Luckily, David Strathairn, who is familiar with Daisy and the town, is appointed to be her lawyer. Can the small-minded folk of the town handle the truth?

This is a story without a whole lot of surprises (some have been trimmed from the novel for brevity), but it’s a satisfying watch with a happy ending. The North Carolina scenery is breathtaking, and Daisy Edgar-Jones is radiant as Kya, though almost too perfect looking; she never has any blemishes or even minor injuries from living on her own. Ditto the young girl who plays her as a child; apart from dirty bare feet, she's reasonably well-kempt. The film is unrated (and goes on a bit too long in my view) with two seduction scenes, one assault scene and a couple incidents of domestic abuse. Also, there is a brief glimpse of Edgar-Jones’ breasts, but that’s it for sex and violence. Children in the double-digits should be able to handle it.",positive

112,Movies & TV,Where the Crawdads Sing [DVD],$19.99,5,"I saw a wonderful movie this weekend, and shortly afterward was quite pleased when I learned that the Rotten Tomato Popular Score was 97%. It deserved it. But then, in almost the same breath, I learned that the critics' score was only 34 ... 34%!

I can't understand how such a score could exist for the movie I just saw, other than critics being the kind of people who love lording their inflated egos over the work of dedicated artists.

For the record, I saw a movie that was character-oriented, suspenseful, mysterious and joyful. I saw a strong woman trying to survive in a world made to destroy her kind, and I saw a love story that did its best to transcend that. I saw a dangerous swamp that was somehow lush, embracing and beautifulI. I saw people behaving in a selfless, noble manner, and others at their most cruel. It was well-acted, and well directed.

What I didn't see is a film that was worth a 34 from supposedly well educated critics. Daisy Edgar-Jones was excellent as the Marsh Girl. Taylor John Smith and Harris Dickinson were great as Tate and Chase, her two love interests, and the always wonderful David Straitham was perfect as the lawyer defending her.

I can understand that there are many who have read the wonderful novel, and might find the film does not capture the beautiful prose of the book. But that is a criticism that disallows the film its own chance to succeed on its own merits ... and you'll miss out on an enjoyable movie at that.

[NOTE: If you like this movie, you may want to see another that goes where this one did ... and it has a star-packed cast, including a very mean, a very un-likeable Keanu Reeves. It's called THE GIFT. ]",positive
113,Movies & TV,Where the Crawdads Sing [DVD],$19.99,3,"The story is solid. Manages to be a romantic melodrama that feels mostly grounded and never like it gets too soapy or tropey. There is one part involving leaves that feels corny, but since it happened only once I'll allow it. I bet many a romance fan would have no problem with that bit.

Though this movie is more about Kya's story than it is about the mystery of what happened to Chase, I thought the it did a surprisingly good job of keeping you guessing about what happened and/or who did it.

The movie's competently directed. The wilderness scenery is truly majestic and the best part of this; my hat off to the location scout. Editing in this can be a little choppy at points.

Pretty good cast all-around in this. Edgar-Jones does a solid job as the lead. David Straitharn plays Kya's lawyer, and yeah it's your basic ""Atticus Finch-esque lawyer who supports the protagonist when no one else will"" trope, but he's definitely the sort of actor you want for that role. (Kind of wished he had more scenes.) The MVP here though is definitely Taylor John Smith as one of Kya's love interests. He completely sells the tender-hearted, protective paramour role here.

Now you're probably wondering why I only kinda like this despite the mostly positive stuff I said above. The movie's too gosh darn long. It didn't need to be two hours and five minutes. The middle in particular felt stretched. I found myself losing attention at several points. I left the theater to go to the bathroom. Usually I try to hold it, or feel annoyed I missed a scene when I can't, but I really didn't mind at all here. The thing is that no scenes needed to be cut, they just needed to slim them down. Pacing does pick up by the third act for what it's worth.

I have no intent to watch this again, but I had a good time. Yeah, I was bored at points but this film can get interesting as well. In all fairness, I'm a guy and I think this written more for the female demographic. I can see a lot of romance fans getting a lot more out of this than me.",fair

120,Movies & TV,Thor: Love and Thunder (Feature) [4K UHD],$29.99,4,"Like the last film, this is directed by Taika Waititi, and again he makes this one of the funniest Marvel movies. Waititi and all the actors involved definitely seem like they're having goofy fun. However, the movie does a serious backbone to several characters' motivations (especially Jane and Gorr, who has a pretty strong ""how-I-became-a-villain"" story.) The ending is particularly good and may surprise you.

Love and Thunder does repeat the sin of the last one Ragnarok, but doubles down on it: there is a little too much reliance on jokes. Waititi seems unable to take many reprieves from the humor, and it can feel like he's trying too hard and that the more serious parts feel undermined. Also, the movie does throw a lot of emotional weight upon Thor, who's already been through the ringer. They really need to give him a breather.

Love and Thunder is definitely creative, more so than Ragnarok where as good as it was, admittedly a large portion was just spent on the Gamemaster's planet. We're thrown from one fantastical setting to the next. Everything looks great (really one of the most impressive looking Marvel films and that's saying something), continuing Ragnarok's combination of fantasy and colorful 70's-style science fiction. Although, like with the humor, Waititi focuses too much on jumping from one thing to the next and some may find it exhausting. Again, the director could've focused a little more on the drama.

Bale is excellent as Gorr. He's completely threatening, yet the character doesn't feel like he's taking himself too seriously, which has been the flaw of some Marvel movie villains. Now that Jane has powers, Natalie Portman is definitely given more to do than in Thor: The Dark World, and she seems to work well with the superhero stuff and the more comic tone the Thor films has taken. But, I think she could've have had a few more scenes to build her character up; some Thor scenes could've been cut.

Recommended, this is a visually exciting, fun time. How does this compare to the other Thor films? I haven't rightly decided. (Definitely better than Thor: The Dark World). This may be the most creative movie, but admittedly has a looser story structure than some of the other films.",positive
121,Movies & TV,Thor: Love and Thunder (Feature) [4K UHD],$29.99,4,"I've long been a loyal follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, enjoying nearly all of the films and the continuing story they've been weaving for over a decade now. I especially liked the couple more recent appearances of Thor, especially in the much acclaimed ""Ragnarok"", which found a way to lighten up his character and not make him such a Shakespearian stick in the mud. And seeing the trailer for this new installment got me hyped to dive back into the utter insane-ness that was usually reserved for the comics. And what I got was a story of how anyone can become a hero, told with the right balance of seriousness and comedy.

It's been a few years since the defeat of Thanos in ""Avengers: Endgame"", and in that time, Thor has been travelling with the Guardians of the Galaxy, getting back into shape and working through his past trauma of losing most of his loved ones. But his relatively care free adventuring comes to a halt when he receives a distress signal from Lady Sif, warning him that a new enemy named Gorr, who has control over darkness and can produce monsters, is on a mission to destroy every god-like being in the universe. And New Asgard is his next target. Upon returning to Earth, Thor is shocked to discover that not only has his old hammer, Mjolnir, repaired itself, but his old girlfriend, Dr. Jane Foster, now wields it---imbuing her with Thor's powers. The two happily team up, and together with their Asgardian friends, they set off on a quest to recruit as much help as they can to defeat Gorr before he finds a way to wipe out all the known gods of the universe. But little does Thor know that Jane is in the middle of a personal battle of her own---a fight with terminal cancer. And using her newfound powers is putting even more of a strain on her body. Will the gods offer a magical cure for her? Or will she find a way to make the most of the time she has left?

Director Taika Waititi is back from ""Ragnarok"", and he once again proves he's the best choice to breathe excitement into Thor's neck of the Marvel woods---not being afraid to show the utter weirdness of the mystical side of the MCU while still bringing plenty of laughs and having characters react the way real humans would if thrown into these bizarre situations---all set to an amazing 80s rock ballad soundtrack. One of the main complaints hurled at the MCU is how it's getting more difficult to keep track of continuity, and is becoming steadily inaccessible to newcomers. While following the franchise up to this point certainly helps, this installment managed to find a way to summarize all the bullet points you need to know via one of the characters telling the story of Thor like one would a campfire tale or myth. So most newcomers shouldn't be too lost. (Great example is my own Mom, who has hardly watched any of the MCU beyond Phase One, yet she was able to follow this movie just fine.)

This film also gives an explanation to how many and which mythologies exist within the Marvel universe, and when the various gods are unwilling to help Thor, it gives off the subtle message that, while believing in a higher power and praying for good fortune isn't a bad thing, it's still up to us mortals to take action to make positive change happen. Case in point, Jane Foster finally returns after being absent from the MCU for so long, and we get to see her as Thor ripped straight from the comic books. Her excited energy at getting to be a superhero is adorable and contagious, and it's nice to see her and Thor patch up their relationship and go into full ""buddy cop"" mode while trying to save the world. But for all the laughs, the film doesn't shy away from the seriousness of Jane contracting cancer, and the fear and anger she feels at having a limited time to live, and how everyone walks on eggshells around her. And over the course of the adventure, our heroes, through her, will learn what it means to truly live and make the most of the time you have on this Earth. Would you rather lie dormant, clinging to what precious minutes you have? Or would you want to die fighting for those you love with the strength you have left? And conversely, Thor must learn that there's some fights that are impossible to win, and to respect his friends' wishes and let them choose their own fates. This all ties into the main villain, Gorr, who although is a bit on the bland side in terms of personality, he at least has strong, clear, and understandable motives for why he does what he does. Without giving away any spoilers, let's just say the climatic end battle is nothing short of amazing, and drives home the lesson that heroes can come from unexpected places, and that sometimes our prayers ARE answered....but not in the exact ways we thought they would.

All n' all, I had a blast with this latest adventure, and I hope that more MCU films continue to be this fun.",positive

As viewers, we experience the black culture that enveloped Elvis' childhood and the R&B and gospel music that he embraced. We learn and feel how deeply these aspects influenced his spirit and style. Austin Butler *channels* Elvis. He effortlessly lures our empathy for those screaming girls in the audience filled with goose bumps and exhilaration, and, later, the agony of Elvis' grief-stricken moments.

142,Movies & TV,Dune (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital) [4K UHD],$21.99,5,"Let me start by saying that Dune is one of my favorite books. I love the story, the characters, the world, and just everything about Frank Herbert's excellent book. It's definitely one of the best sci-fi books of all time.

That being said, I absolutely adore this movie. All of Denis Villeneuve's movies I've seen have been fantastic, and this one is no exception. I've seen the 1984 David Lynch movie four times (it's one of those movies I love because of how bad it is), and this one is infinitely better.
This movie is much truer to the characters and general feel of the book, while still being a fantastic movie. Obviously, a lot had to be cut out, and a few things changed from the book (even though this is only the first half of the book) -- that's to be expected with any onscreen adaptation of a book. But, like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies, this adaptation kept to the spirit of the book and changed exactly what need to be changed for it to work well onscreen. It's obvious that Denis Villeneuve is a huge fan of the book, and understands it very well. He is able to portray that sense of enormous scale that the book has.

I will put a caveat here: if you don't like longer-feeling, atmospheric, dramatic movies with slowly building tension, this movie is not for you. If you're looking for a fast-paced action flick, look elsewhere.

The cast is fantastic. I wasn't a fan of Timothee Chalamet before and was thus skeptical when I saw that he was going to be playing Paul. But, after watching this movie, that skepticism disappeared. Everyone is great in this movie, even Jason Mamoa -- I thought he would just basically be Jason Mamoa in this movie, like he pretty much is in a lot of things, but he portrayed the character of Duncan Idaho very well. The big standout for me was Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica: she was absolutely fantastic.

Huge props to the crew! The design work is so good; it doesn't feel like all the generic sci-fi designs that I've come to expect from modern movies -- I love the designs of the ornithopters. The sets and costumes are spot on to what I imagined when reading the book. The sound design and music was phenomenal -- Hans Zimmer and hi team did a great job with the score, it's obvious they put a lot of passion into this project. And, as with all of Denis Villeneuve's movies I've seen, the camera work and lighting is great and perfectly fits the tone of the book. Last, but definitely not least, the special effects were impeccable. They obviously planed out all of the post production work before filming, because all the CGI and effects blends seamlessly with the practical stuff: there was nothing I saw that looked CGI.

My thoughts on the adaptation:
Good movie adaptations of books are very hard to find. That being said, I thing this adaptation is one of the best I've ever seen, second only to The Lord of the Rings movies.
To all the book fans who wanted this movie to be a 1:1 adaptation from the book, this movie will be a disappointment. Anytime you are adapting a written work for the screen, so many changes have to be made for the story to translate well to the screen. A 1:1 adaptation would not be good onscreen.
Denis Villeneuve obviously understands and loves the source material, and it shows.

One thing they did a particularly good job with, was portraying the inner thoughts and nuances of the characters. In the book, which is written in third-person omniscient, you are presented with the characters' inner thoughts. The David Lynch Dune tried to do this more 1:1, having the disembodied voices of the characters whisper their inner thoughts as things played out onscreen, which...did not work at all. It came off as cheesy, stupid, and was very distracting.
This movie however, due to its fantastic script, the direction, and the great performances, was able to communicate what needed to be communicated.

I will say that I was disappointed that Dr. Yueh didn't get more screen time -- I feel the movie could have benefitted from developing his character more, as he is a very important character in the book, and a big part of the impact of his actions is because we get to know the character and his relationship with the Atreides family. But, I do understand why they cut out a lot of that.

As a lover of the book, I feel that the cuts and changes they made were all perfectly justified, and are part of what made this such a great movie.

Another big thing about this movie is that it treats the audience like intelligent adults. Nothing is dumbed down -- like it is in most movies nowadays, where the movie spoon feeds the audience. This tendency in modern movies has created a general movie-going audience that is unable to properly digest or appreciate anything more than a blockbuster cash-grab action movie. I'm not trying to be snooty or pretentious or anything. I'm just saying that a lot of bad reviews for this movie are coming from people who are judging it as though it were made as a blockbuster action sci-fi show. In order to properly evaluate this movie, one must take into account the context of the movie and the space in which it occupies.

This is not to say that people who dislike this movie are idiots, or that they have no taste. It's perfectly acceptable and understandable if you do not like this movie; it's definitely not for everyone. All I'm saying is that, just because you don't like it, doesn't mean it's bad.
Judging this movie as what it's trying to be, and as an adaptation of the book, it succeeds on almost every level.

As for how the movie is for people who do not know the story, those I know who have seen it without knowing the story previously were able to follow the story and understand the characters very well. That being said, they share my taste in cinema with a lot of things and they knew what to expect going into this movie -- that it wasn't just a generic sci-fi action romp.

Overall, after I've seen this movie five times since it came out in theaters, it has cemented itself as one of my favorite movies of all time. It's nothing short of a miracle that this movie wasn't completely ruined by executive and studio interference. It was definitely worth the wait, and I cannot wait to see part II!

Honestly, go look up Brandon Sanderson's review of this movie on YouTube -- it reflects my thoughts on this movie very well.

DO WATCH if:
-You like the book
-You enjoy well-made sci-fi
-You love more atmospheric movies with somewhat slow building tension

DO NOT WATCH if:
-You hate movie adaptations of books no matter what
-You don't like movies with little to no comedy (seriously, the comedy is almost nonexistent)
-You don't like slower-paced movies

I would say, at least give it a try, no matter what. Who knows, maybe this movie will be the first of its kind that you like ;)",positive
143,Movies & TV,Dune (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital) [4K UHD],$21.99,5,"Making a Dune movie (or series) has been tried many times but this is by far the best job to date. I first read Dune over 40 yrs ago and have read it several times since, so I'm pretty critical of any movie or series. The 1984 version was very good but I loathed it's idea for 'Voice' and the 'Weirding Way' of fighting. Another attempt had an open-air waterfall on Dune and I wondered if they even bothered to read to book at all.

This film is very, very good in both those areas. It's handling of Voice is -almost- perfect. And water (I should say moisture) discipline on Dune is treated well - though I am making allowance for what the poor video effect would be of having Fremen wearing covering caps, forehead pads, and using their mask all the time outdoors. That may be more correct but it would make filming difficult. They did use the full cap and mask on the one real 'sand crossing' they made, though.

A lot of side stories were left out but nothing that was critical in my opinion. If they had put everything into the movie they would barely make it to Dune before running out of time and it would have to be at least a 4-part 'movie'.

All in all I think Denis Villeneuve's Dune attempt is excellent so far and I expect great things from Pt 2. I was really happy to see the studio approve Pt 2 as quickly as they did.

***Some Spoilers***
- I loved the use of the desert mouse over and over in various scenes. Hopefully, this is foreshadowing of what's to come.
- Their treatment of ornithopters was --awesome--, dragonflies instead of birds but the effect is so great I would call it an improvement over the original (though the double-seater craft should have been front-back wings instead of over/under). If Herbert had known more about dragonfly aerodynamics he may have taken that approach, too.
- Their handling of the worms was -magnificent- and worth every penny they spent for the CGI on those and their effect on the sand around them. The sand waves the worms made was great. They really brought home the impact of something so large on such small creatures like men and even not-so-small machines like the harvester.
- The Imperial Testing Station was a bit out of line with it's open ceilings but they did have the plants and the original explanation of why it was there. They even covered the ornithopter that brought everyone to the station.
- Kynes' death scene was a bit different but the original would have taken much more time and this adaptation was acceptable.
- The first sand crossing for Paul and Jessica was done really well, clear down to the drum sand, and included an added scene where they rest out in the desert, which was excellent.
- The fight with Jamis was not in sietch like the original but I understand they were making a hard cut between Part 1 & Part 2 - making it obvious Pt 2 will be mostly with the Fremen including in sietch.
- I wasn't too happy about the troop not wearing their caps on their way to sietch Tabr but that's the only real fault I have with the movie. Though I did approve of the Fremen's handling of Jamis' body.

I can't wait for Pt2!!

PS I did remember one other Big Oops in the movie. During the Harkonnen invasion of Arrakeen there was a (what looked to be space-ship mounted) laser being used in one scene. To me, that completely negated the whole explanation of why lasers aren't in common use as a weapon.",positive
144,Movies & TV,Dune (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital) [4K UHD],$21.99,4,"First of all let me say the challenge of adapting Dune from page to screen is formidable. Dune is one of the most seminal works of Science Fiction and was one of the first SF books to attempt to incorporate Social, Political and Ecological plotlines into a single story. Herbert also attempted huge world building that is probably only equaled by Lord of the Rings, in the Fantasy genre. So, it is no surprise that attempts to turn Dune into a movie or TV series, has only had limited success.

The most successful attempt up to now has been the 1984 film version by David Lynch. Initially a flop on release, it has since gained a cult following and has many aspects to admire, especially the Set and Costume Designs. The release was notable for the movie being taken away from Lynch for the final cut of the film, after which he disowned the movie entirely. The released version of the film attempts to sandwich the entire book into a single movie and it does suffer from the short runtime. As a result, many people found the film hard to follow and key aspects of the book were ruthlessly trimmed.

Which brings us to the newer version of Dune directed by Denis Villeneuve. Coming off the critically acclaimed SF adaptation of Arrival and the less well received sequel to Blade Runner, Villeneuve appears to have all the right credentials to adapt Dune. I don't necessarily agree with all his choices, but the key one to split the book over 2 movies, is the correct one, if you are looking to create a version faithful to the book. I cannot fault the Casting of the movie which are all significant improvements over the 1984 version, especially Stellen Skarsgard who is a particularly creepy Baron H compared to the over the top and campy version played by Kenneth McMillan.

The new version has a very muted color pallet. The scenes on Caladan are all greys and blacks. On Arrakis we have dark interiors and obviously sand and earth toned exteriors. The 1984 version is a Technicolor dream in comparison. The set designs are all all realized where possible, by actual physical sets, with very limited CGI, which enhances the visual look of the film. The overall tone of the film is I would say ""serious"" with the only levity coming from a droll Josh Brolin as Gurney and Jason Momoa who seems to have wandered in from Aquaman, playing a very physical samurai version of Duncan Idaho.

My main gripe with the film is that many of the key scenes did not generate much excitement for me. For example, the key face-off between Paul and Jamis is so low key and dare I say, underwhelming that I wish that they had built up this confrontation more. Jason Momoa shines in all his scenes and injects some much needed energy into the proceedings.

I am torn somewhat between the more camp, off the wall approach from Lynch and the deadly seriousness and starkness of Villeneuve's vision. While Dune 2021 is beautiful and well acted, I was hoping for a slightly less dour version. So definitely worth watching, but know going in, this is a very different animal to any of the MCU or DCEU flicks, you may be thinking this will resemble.

Final note - if you were unable to see this in a Cinema, then the 4K Bluray does the film justice with both outstanding picture quality and encompassing Dolby Atmos sound.",positive
145,Movies & TV,Dune (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital) [4K UHD],$21.99,5,"This Denis Villeneuve version of Dune, the long-awaited film since the relatively lackluster 1984 film of the Frank Herbert novel, is a rock-solid sci-fi experience that puts Dune on the map for good, and shows promise for the start of a franchise of future films. THE PROS: Excellent acting, faithful to the Herbert novel, the characters bring an emotional depth to their respective roles, and the costumes aren’t over the top. THE CONS: The music is your typical Hollywood score these days with jolting, thunderous, booming sounds that are overindulgent at times, especially for what’s really a soft science fiction film. Why does the audience have to be shaken by the score these days? Hans Zimmer is very good in spotting his music to match the scenes, but it’s loud at times. Also, the film is a tad bland in its color. To sum up: This version of Frank Herbert’s novel is very good, and even those who haven’t read the novel will find plenty to like to the point of wanting to read Herbert in the future. One can tell that Villeneuve was laser-focused on delivering the plot in the proper way to appease fans of the novel. There are some incredible and memorable shots in this film, however. I really like Director Villeneuve’s visual style. The blu ray looks fantastic, and the special features are very cool.",positive
146,Movies & TV,Dune (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital) [4K UHD],$21.99,4,"I went in hoping very much that this would be really good. I am a huge fan of Frank Herbert's novels. The studio spent a fortune and it shows. CG effects all wonderful, and so are the practical sets. In terms of the writing, the major events of the story are all presented. The men's costumes are great, but most of the women's costumes (Jessica and the Bene Gesserit) are either surprisingly plain or just silly and unattractive. The color palette of the film falls into the blue and orange that graces almost every science fiction DVD case for the last 20 years. Caladan and space is overall blue, Dune is orange. (Was this an intentional choice by the director? Is he joking with us?) Timothee Chalamet as Paul Atreides is fine for this portion of the story but it is hard to imagine that he will be able to bring the maturity, cunning, masculinity, and ruthlessness of the character as the story progresses. The rest of the large ensemble cast give good performances (Stellan Skarsgard is great) in their roles. Some roles were built up bigger than they are in the book, while others were (strangely) de-emphasized. In particular the roles of Lady Jessica, Baron Harkonnen, and Piter Devries were reduced, while the roles of Duncan Idaho (a very small and short role in the book) and Chani (mostly seen in Paul's dreams for this portion of the novel) are overemphasized to the detriment of the story and the pace of the film, so much so that I felt as if I had seen more of them than the main character. I suppose that the studio wanted to feature Jason Momoa and Zendaya (both currently bigger stars than most of the rest of the cast including the lead) for the sake of media exposure and audience draw. Overall it is a great spectacle and a fine achievement. I do like it.....BUT IT DRAGS ON and ON and ON. No one wants to see people walking in a very heavy wind over and over again. In the rain. Down a ramp. In the desert. Things that are not visually interesting and which do not advance or elucidate the story last forever, while things that are important to the story and the lead character's development are left out entirely. Also the story has been refocused to
only show Paul Atreides as the man who will lead the Fremen to victory and subsequent freedom from their oppressors. He does indeed do that, but his plans and ambition are actually much bigger and he conquers the galaxy afterward (using his Fremen army) to spread the Gospel of Paul Atreides (thinly disguised Islam) at the expense of countless millions of lives. It is clear, however, that the writers and director are trying REALLY REALLY hard to avoid this aspect of the story as much as possible. In order to secure funding and make money, I suppose they have to do this, but it turns the story into a rather generic space opera that lacks the depth, complexity, and deeply tragic nature of the novel. The film: 4 stars. Everyone go read the book! Several times. It is a very complex, layered story and a slow, dense read. You can't skim it, or you won't get it.",positive
147,Movies & TV,Dune (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital) [4K UHD],$21.99,4,"If you have seen the original ""DUNE"" you will be disappointed. Based on the original I would assume that they are planning on two more movies to finish the story. The first 75% of the movie is a reenactment of the original. The effects are good, some of the new actors are good some are not. I am basing my opinion on the original and Director's cut. I say the original at the theater and was disappointed. Years later and I watched it again and now I rewatch it probably once a year. I have also seen the Sifi miniseries and would say that it was better than this version. I have never read the books I'll wait awhile and rewatch this version again and see if I liked or not.",positive
148,Movies & TV,Dune (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital) [4K UHD],$21.99,4,"I love the original Dune, even though many bad mouth, and it's one of my favorite movies. I've read many of the books, even those by his son, so I was very excited to see this movie. I was fearful that we'd get a director/producer that would potentially ruin the movie, but I was glad to see that wasn't the case.

So why do I give it 4 stars instead of 5? Partly it's because a star system is limited but mainly because the movie just drags on and on at times. We'll have what seems like five minutes of a single shot which is just the scenario. Which is great, the cinematics are fantastic in this film... they just needed to be edited a little. If this film had better pacing/flow it'd be far better in my opinion.

I also didn't think Timothee Chalamet was the right fit for the character. This has nothing to do with his performance, but simply his appearance. He's not an accurate depiction of what his character should be. Is he going to bulk up / grow in any future movies? He's suppose to start off as 16. Yes, Timothee Chalamet looks young... but he's 26 and looks 16... what'll happen when he needs to look older? I would of much preferred to see someone like Ben Barnes (Punisher, Westworld, Shadow and Bone) play the role. Though while he's in incredible shape and looks far younger than being born in 1981, you'd want someone a bit younger. Timothee Chalamet just doesn't give ultimate warrior / king vibes... gives... tween vibes.

The movie business is hard though, casting is often times political. Whoever you basically devote yourself to using them for years to come. This means they need a stable life style and will age as the years go on. But if all I really have bad to say about the movie is one casting choice and slow pacing... not a bad movie.

I've read other reviews about this film and people are all comparing it to the 1984 film that finished the movie in one actual movie. People forget that Dune has countless novels so for them to make a part 2 or 3 is expected because there is so much lore.

If you want a Sci-Fi film, this is it. Sci-Fi to the core. Acting is brilliant, music is outstanding, and visually this movie so beautiful. But because this is a part 1, you'll be left with unfinished answers which is totally fine.

If they dialed back the prophetic visions just a bit and included more of the enemy plotting, and the interaction between Paul and his dad it would have been better. Mini series or television would have been a better way to adapt this series.

152,Movies & TV,1883: A Yellowstone Origin Story,$24.96,4,"The negative reviewers just want an action packed Western with lots of violence and blood. This series also has heart and gives the viewer insight as to what pioneer families went through with family loss and other hardships (disease, etc). So these negative reviews are from people who are addicted to an instant “rush” of violence and blood. If that’s their thing, I get it; we live in a world of people needing some kind of fix. I prefer living in a world where you watch a movie or series and let the story unfold over time—you know, like life.

The only thing that bugged me is the comparison of man to mere animals. We are NOT the same as animals and I have noticed this disturbing and Godless trend in many shows and movies lately in what I see as an attempt to spread an anti-Biblical narrative. If you can ignore that (most pioneers came from devout Christian backgrounds), you will enjoy the series. Word of caution though; there’s a bit too much modern-day vernacular cursing (lots of F bombs); also not realistic for that time period. But hey it’s TV. Sadly I guess the writers felt the need to give mainstream audiences something they could relate to in that way. Despite the flaws, it was still an enjoyable series.",positive

The character of Elsa pretty much spoils a lot of later episodes. It's too bad too, because Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, and Sam Elliot all do an amazing job playing their roles. The actress who plays Elsa doesn't do a bad job either it's just a terrible character for a Western. It's like merging a modern coming of age teen character into a late 1800s Western.",fair
154,Movies & TV,1883: A Yellowstone Origin Story,$24.96,5,"Don't let the negative reviews sway you. 1883 is absolutely incredible. 3 Emmy nominations, including best cinematography and best score. The show perfectly balances the beauty and awe experienced in the American west with the downright horrid living conditions and reality of the late 1800's. Despite being a western, the story is completely original and undoubtedly tragic.

I'm not sure where the negative reviews are coming from; the show is slower paced than most modern movies/shows and is far from the popular superhero/MCU style of writing, but if anything this should be a positive as original quality content is far and few between. I suppose some aren't fans of sad stories, and if so than this show is definitely not for you because it's a tear-jerker. The historically inaccurate complaints are baseless; the show contains an incredibly accurate depiction of life in the late 1800's so much so that inconveniences of the day are a driving point in the plot.

This is a must-watch show of the decade. Stunning beyond belief from visual, audio, and strength of story standpoints. If it released on more than just Paramount, I think it would have had similar success to Yellowstone and Game of Thrones (before seasons 7-8).",positive
155,Movies & TV,1883: A Yellowstone Origin Story,$24.96,5,"I almost didn't watch because of the bad reviews and am so glad I didn't miss it. Because of the flashbacks in Yellowstone, I expected the show to be very different. When I realized it was going to be mostly a showcase for the young actress playing Elsa, I wasn't the least disappointed. She was lovely and the narration was perfect. I thought the production values around the action scenes were excellent. Those horses! The scene when she was playing the piano and the camera would cut to the battle taking place back at the camp. I wonder if Taylor Sheridan realized he wrote a young adult romance. I loved the 'heavenly' ending. I agree with one reviewer who said it would be helpful if we could give a thumbs up or down to some of these reviews. It is almost as if we have Russian trolls even on Amazon Prime Video. It's not as if this is the first storyline that developed a romantic relationship between a Native American and a settler. I am also tired of people who object to language. Really, I'm an old lady and I couldn't care less. Then there are the people who literally need to be a testament to their religion in a movie review. My goodness. I guess some people just have to go there. Anyway, I do have one complaint. I thought all of the acting was good. Tim, Faith, Sam...great job and with all others. The two young actors who played Elsa's lovers were great and Isabel was just wonderful. But the make up. What was that? Why was Faith made up to look so dark and both her and Tim's bushy eyebrows? They are both good looking people and the overdone makeup made them unattractive. The brief performance of the sister was also excellent. The Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson cameos were great fun. Billy Bob too. I loved binging this series. Elsa's narration was like a prose poem. I mean it. You really should do a book adaptation, Taylor. Btw, you seem to get better looking as you get wealthier. Not bad. You are becoming the second most famous Taylor. I love her too. Maybe her greatest oldest living fan. xo Jane",positive
156,Movies & TV,1883: A Yellowstone Origin Story,$24.96,5,"I cannot for the life of me fathom the criticisms of the people leaving one star reviews. This series very accurately portrayed the hardships of a westward journey by inexperienced pioneers and the many ways one could die in the west in those days. Contrary to my skepticism, Tim McGraw and faith hill did an excellent job of acting their parts in spite of not being professional actors. Sam Elliot added to the production with his iconic western tough guy persona.

The way in which this story was told through the eyes of an adventurous 18 year old girl was novel with the interjections of her narrations at key points. The dialog was quite poetic and enthralling and encompassed the adventure of a westward journey accurately and eloquently.

This series reminded me a lot of lonesome dove mixed with dances with wolves. A cattle drive from Texas to Montana with trials and tribulations along the way. Led by hard core cowboys - including a black character - everything that could kill or maim you was encountered along the way. And the sheer brutality of those life or death situations was an uncensored version of what it must have been like. Lonesome dove had that as well but this was was a more R rated version of the same storyline.

I would call 1883 an epic tale with outstanding narration and panoramic cinematography and a well put together storyline acted by an excellent cast.

167,Movies & TV,The Running Man Limited Edition Steelbook,$27.99,4,"The Running Man [Blu-ray ] played exactly as advertised. This is a crisp HD transfer of one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1980s action films.

The Running Man is a story of a society run amok with power - a simplified Orwellian nightmare on a b-movie scale, one with fascist controls over the population, plenty of propaganda, fabrication and manipulation of news, and a #1 TV show where convicts are publicly forced to combat gladiators for a chance at freedom.

Schwarzenegger plays Ben Richards, a former government agent turned convict who ends up on ""The Running Man,"" TV show, fighting for his life against his would-be executioners. The acting is clearly b-movie grade, but beyond watching Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime, the secondary highlight is watching Richard Dawson play Killian, the host of the show. Dawson lends his experience from over 25 years of game shows and talk shows to provide a slightly darker side of himself, a character that has no problem with making sport of man's life.

The film itself is presented in 7.1 DTS-HD, and this blu-ray version looks and sounds better than anything I've ever previously experienced. Included in audio options are 2 different commentaries. One features director Paul Michael Glaser and producer Tim Zinnemann. The other is by the film's executive producer, Rob Cohen.

In the Special Features section, this blu-ray contains the theatrical trailer and 2 documentaries.

One is a documentary short titled ""Lockdown on Main Street: Civil Liberties Post 9/11."" It's a somewhat biased look at the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. The documentary is concerned with just how far the US government could go with PATRIOT, based on the loose scope and resulting broad power contained within that law.

The other documentary is ""Game Theory: An Examination of Reality TV."" This documentary examines the intricacies of reality television and how the shows manipulate the reality they purport to portray. It also addresses the growing amount of surveillance cameras in daily life, and in a slightly-biased point of view, they play up the concern for peoples' liberty associated with these new potential intrusions.

Comparatively, this is a no-frills blu-ray release. The audio commentaries are nice, but the special features section is sparse when stacked up against your average popular film's blu-ray release. There are no deleted scenes, nor is there a still gallery with lobby cards and other memorabilia. 2 mediocre documentaries and a theatrical trailer is all you get for extras.

Anyone who is a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger films, however, should be completely satisfied with this product.",positive
168,Movies & TV,The Running Man Limited Edition Steelbook,$27.99,4,"The Running Man is a film based on a surprisingly good short story by Stephen King. King's tale, a sort of beefed-up '1984', has a man on the run not only from the law, but from a repressive society at large. It's gritty, gruesome, and so different from the film as to be nearly unrecognizable.
The film itself is quite good, although it should be noted from the onset that it has a lot of truly agonizing mid-1980s styles and mannerisms. Some seem almost farcical, such as the earrings and female hairstyles, but if you can look beyond them you'll likely enjoy this film. In a nutshell, good ol' Arnie plays a cop (really a special police trooper) who refuses to fire on unarmed food rioters and is arrested. Society has been transformed into a totalitarian nightmare where the masses are controlled through the media and spoon-fed various gameshows such as 'Climbing for Dollars' where people try to avoid attack dogs and earn cash prizes, and of course the most popular, the Running Man. The Running Man itself is a gameshow in which fugitives are released into 200 square blocks (the ""game zone"") of burnt out LA and then chased around by stalkers as a live studio audience watches. You can probably see where this is going.
Long story short, of course Arnie and his buddies end up in The Running Man show and are chased around by some colorful and entertaining stalkers. The film does a fairly good job of playing around with the underlying social commentaries of facism and media control (Robocop actually does a better job, and there are similar tongue-in-cheek remarks made in Starship Troopers). Stalkers are picked to chase our heroes by housewives who like them ""big and cuddly,"" audience members are chosen a la The Price is Right to win extra prizes including ""The Running Man Home Version"" board game, and as Arnie smashes, bludgeons, mauls, and one-liners his way through the various stalkers sent to kill him, he gradually wins over the crowd, and manages to roll back the media control gripping the masses.
The film isn't nearly as gritty as the novel, and often seems downright cartoonish, with stalkers effectively interchangeable with modern professional wrestlers (in a few cases literally, such as Jesse ""Captain Freedom"" Ventura, who does a hilarious turn as a retired champion tapped to do away with vexatious Ahnold and who refuses to wear pastic robot armor for the home audience). All in all the film is a guilty pleasure with its endlessly entertaining one-liners and is about on par with Total Recall for its production values.

This is definitely a Hi Definition transfer, and much better quality than the letter box DVD I had previously. What might throw you is that the opening graphics might have been cgi (1980s cgi) and the film looks like the cinematographer subconsciously wanted it to be black and white. The transfer was probably from a vault copy of the film, not the negative. Its a clean transfer of a clean copy of the film.

190,Movies & TV,Outlander - Season 6 [DVD],$27.99,5,"I will admit that I have yet to see Season 6 as I have to wait for each season to come out on DVD before I can watch. BUT, the series taken as a whole is simply magnificent. Frankly, it has it all - romance, intrigue, political violence, history, time travel, drama, comedy, wonderful characters & stunning cinematography. IMO, the cinematography is of equal splendor & quality as such big-budget, full-length Hollywood movies as 'Out of Africa' & 'Dances with Wolves'.

The characters are all well-rounded, believable & supremely acted by an excellent cast, particularly Catriona Balfe (Claire Beauchamp-Randall-Fraser/""Sassenach"") & Sam Heughan (Jamie Fraser) whose on-screen chemistry crackles with a nearly insane level of intensity. Additionally, Tobias Menzies, in the dual roles of 20th Century Frank Randall & 18th Century Captain Jonathan ""Blackjack"" Randall, exhibits a wonderful depth of ability to believably swing from the loving, mild-mannered Frank to the deliciously evil & sadistic ""Blackjack"" Randall.

The whole time-traveling aspect of the series could have very easily come off as cheesy in lesser hands but the incredible effort & care the series puts into recreating period accuracy, right down to the dresses and even replicating ancient tartan patterns & colors instead of using the modern ones, makes one feel like one really IS transported 200 years into the past. It's details like this that give the entire production a nearly unrivaled richness & feel of authenticity. Probably the only other series that I can think of that came close to the same production level as 'Outlander' was 'Downton Abbey'.

As for those criticizing Claire & her daughter, Bri, for ""constantly being too 20th century & PC"", I have to ask, why wouldn't they be? After all, they both lived many years in the 20th century prior to being transported to the 1700's by the stones at Craigh Na Dun. Those 20th century ideas, phrases & sensibilities would be ingrained in them & would reflexively come out whether they wanted them to, or not.

Lastly, I absolutely enjoy this series because I can relate to Claire & Jamie's story...proud Scots being chased from their land by tyranny & oppression after the Jacobite Rising of 1745 ended in defeat at the Battle of Culloden. I'm a descendant of Clan MacKenzie & Clan MacFarlane. My ancestors made their home around the shores of the beautiful Loch Lomond but were forced to flee to the Scots-Irish Ulster Plantation in Northern Ireland after Culloden and, from there, to the New World where they fought & shed their blood during the American Revolution, just as Jamie & Claire do in the 'Outlander' series. In a strange way, I feel as though this series gives me an opportunity to ""meet"" my ancestors and, as a history & ancestry geek, that's a priceless feeling.

200,Movies & TV,Sonic The Hedgehog 2 [DVD],$17.96,4,"First off...nice page image, guys!

For an actual review of the film, I'll preface that I've loved the game series since the 90s, so I am THAT sort of fan you might expect to either unconditionally love or hate the thing.

I don't feel either extreme about it. I definitely enjoyed the watch enough to see it a few times to pick up the details. And there are many details!

The first Sonic film had almost nothing to do with the games except you had a blue hedgehog named Sonic and an evil human named Robotnik/Eggman. This film swung in the opposite direction and introduces a surprisingly large amount of lore from several games.

This is a very good thing and made the movie better than the first in my opinion, but it did have a minor downside because of it: you can't always flesh everything out when you include so many characters. Here, Tails and Knuckles are introduced together instead of one game apart, and Tails suffers for it.

Fair disclosure: the team did a fantastic job with Knuckles. The red rage monster is a great blend of honorable warrior who also happens to be quite clueless due to his loner lifestyle. He is both epic and hilarious and I couldn't bear to say there should be less of him.

Tails is also characterized well...in what you do see of him. He's an adorable nerd, and his bond with Sonic is incredibly sweet, but it's also incredibly rushed, making his introduction and contribution less meaningful.

Since I don't want less of Knuckles but I do want more of Tails...can we just dispense with the human characters already? You need Eggman and I can see why we have Tom and Maddie, but everyone else, Stone, Wade, Rachel, Randall, Jojo...they really didn't deserve the screentime they were given. I don't know that anyone, new or old fans alike, was watching a Sonic film to see the hedgehog's adoptive human aunt get married for a good thirty minutes.

Without delving too deep into spoilers, there is a sneakily “valid” reason we had the wedding plotline, but it didn’t have to be so long, or said reveals could have been done with characters we cared more about. Something to bear in mind for the next movie!

Finally…I’m not sure who the target audience is for this. If it’s marketed as a family-friendly film (and it should be), we really could go without the excessive almost-swearing and dirty jokes. I’m an adult and didn’t care for it, and as I watched this with my sister and her young children, she was not amused either. Why did we need to hear characters talk about a wedding wax in a Sonic film again?

Other minor nitpicks include some glitchy CGI in a few places (watch Knuckles’ cheeks when he says “hour of sorrow”) and a bit of concern that they took the “thoughts into power” line from the games a bit too literally.

But that aside, I did enjoy the film. The action was enjoyable, and I laughed at several nods to the games and other surprisingly goofy moments. The games have been at their best when they don't take themselves too seriously, and this movie continues that trend.

And considering how I went into the first movie expecting to hate it, have enjoyed both entries, re-watched them multiple times, and can’t wait to see the third movie, I would definitely say it was a success.

Like our spiky protagonist, just make sure we keep moving forward, eh?",positive
201,Movies & TV,Sonic The Hedgehog 2 [DVD],$17.96,5,"It's not everyday that a sequel of a film is good...

It's also not everyday that a sequel is better than it's predecessor...
- - - -

I watched this with my friends on Discord Server where we host events, watch parties, and more. We watched this movie after Morbius as a MUCH needed palette cleanser.
Unlike Morbius, this movie was fun, and had a A and B plot to follow giving the film layers.

Even though it is a kids movie, Morbius made Sonic the Hedgehog 2 seem very sophisticated and a movie I believe even Spielberg would call a ""cinematic masterpiece"". I'd dare say the most grumpiest person would find peace and happiness with this film in comparison and even the most refined adults would even clap at the end credits should this been in a fancy theater.

The set up for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 follows the events of the first film and some time has passed, watching Sonic interact with his found family has been cute and heartwarming and generally fun to watch. I also loved seeing how his friendship with his newest friend, Miles unfold!

The movie is paced really well, if someone told me the movie was a massive passion project, and made with love and care with every stitch, I'd believe them without contest. It feels true to the source material while also being a competent film that caters well to children AND adults!

Parent's do NOT sleep on this film, no really, don't fall asleep or leave the room when you first air this! Watch this with your kid to share the cool and cute moments of this film together. If you're childless like me, watch it with friends or your family ! It's really fun! Watch it alone if you must but if you have a discord server, stream it to the server for people to hop in and out of!

Highly recommend, 2 thumbs and big toes up!",positive
202,Movies & TV,Sonic The Hedgehog 2 [DVD],$17.96,5,"Whatever magic the team that put this together needs to be shared with the rest of Hollywood so they can use it on other video game IP and stop the failtrain that has been going on when any production company tries to bring a game to the big screen. not just that they made the original that was a blast, but the sequel was as well, better in a lot of ways. that's atypical of Hollywood these days. And if they actually go through with the next installment, may actually produce a trilogy of successful translation from your console to film. like any movie that is mostly a kid's flick this also does what other kids movies have done and added many little references, jokes, and quips that adults will pick up on and have a good chuckle while they go over your kids heads. not only that, if you're one that has fond memories of the sonic series you will enjoy seeing them again without the frustration of dissecting a platform game to see the conclusion. and to think, this could have gone horribly awry if the producers hadn't taken fan reaction to the first character model of sonic seriously and made those edits. good job, great film, a nice bit of brevity in our hectic and often stressful world. have a look at it, its worth your time.",positive

There are you typical heartfelt moments as you’d expect, your comic relief from sonic as well, and there’s plenty of action to keep the kids interested. Not to mention the visuals look stunning this time around. You can tell they took their time and cleaned up the character models and made the CGI as realistic and believable as they could. The story was great, the characters played well off of each other and they left it wide open for the inevitable third movie. My only concern is where they’re going to take Robotnik’s storyline now that Jim Carrey is “retiring”. No spoilers in this review, so all I’ll say is they set it up where it can be done with or without him reprising his role as Robotnik but I really hope he at least comes back for the third movie maybe as his farewell piece.",positive

225,Movies & TV,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Limited-Edition Steelbook,$18.49,4,"The previous Indiana Jones movie the Temple of Doom was a horrible take on an exploitation movie. The Last Crusade got the franchise back on track with Jones (Harrison Ford) re-uniting with his estranged father Henry Jones (Sean Connery) and facing off with the Nazis once again in a search for the Holy Grail.

I really like the start of the film. It has a young Indiana played by River Phoenix. It shows how Indiana got his whip and hat, why he didn’t like snakes and most importantly how he got into archeology. It’s a great bit of background for the entire franchise.

The story itself is played out like a great mystery as Indiana goes through a series of clues to find the Grail. He climbs through crypts, gets chased, etc.

Then when he runs into his father it starts getting comedic as the two play an odd couple.

In the end, The Last Crusade re-creates the sense of excitement and adventure into mythology and history that the original did.

226,Movies & TV,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Limited-Edition Steelbook,$18.49,5,"Most of the time when a third movie in a series comes out, it is typically not really that great. Think Godfather III or Alien 3. But with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, we get a return to what made the original Raiders of the Lost Ark so great, but with some added growth that ranks this as one of the best such movies ever made.

Returning for this adventure alongside Indiana Jones are his cohorts Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot) - sadly no Marion Ravenwood though. We are also introduced to Indy as a teen in the Boy Scouts and learn just where he acquires the hat and the scar on his chin.

Once Harrison Ford returns to the screen, we pick up action in 1938, where Indy is retrieving the cross of Coronado in a great sequence that serves as a bookend to the opening young Indy sequence. After that, Indy later receives a diary from his father (Sean Connery as professor Henry Jones), who has turned up missing while on an expedition in pre-WWII Europe. Indy and Brody meet with Walter Donovan, a US businessman with an apparent interest in the European expedition that Henry Jones was on. Indy and Brody promptly head for Europe, Venice Italy to be precise, to find the missing Jones.

What follows is a well-written movie with some memorable dialogue and characters that resonate. The introduction of Henry Jones was perfectly done. He gives Indiana Jones a human quality that he maybe didn't have quite enough of in the earlier movies - now, instead of a guy who wears a great hat and an even greater coat and carries a bullwhip, and can foil the plans of Nazis and other bad guys as he makes things up as he goes along, he is now a man with a past, a man with a strained relationship with his father, and a man who will grow emotionally as he patches up his relationship with his dad.

Some of the dialogue that stands out to me even so many years later ....

""Don't call me Junior!""
""Nazis... I hate these guys!""
""He chose ... poorly.""

This entry in the series stands up well alongside Raiders of the Lost Ark and is quite a satisfying adventure movie.",positive

230,Movies & TV,Inglourious Basterds - 4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital [4K UHD],$13.50,5,"Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Diane Kruger and Daniel Brühl lead the riveting 2009 film by Quentin Tarantino in a whirlwind Graphic Violence and Language film similar to past productions. Known by true experience of “The Basterds,” is a mischievous and smart ride to take down the leaders of the Third Reich. Waltz was the only one to receive an Oscar of the 10 nominations.

Don't have the Blu Ray version so buying it at 9.99 isn't a bad deal.",fair
234,Movies & TV,Inglourious Basterds - 4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital [4K UHD],$13.50,4,"Well, I'll tell you this...if you do not own this on physical media, pick this 4K set up while it's on sale. Some scenes look stunning in 4K while a majority of the film looks like the Blu-ray version. In the extras, you do not get the whole film of the original 70's Inglorious Bastards. It's just a small featurette about the somewhat influence Taratino had on watching the film back in the day. Universal has been doing great on their 4K releases. This one was disappointing.",positive

236,Movies & TV,Inglourious Basterds - 4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital [4K UHD],$13.50,1,"I absolutely loved the 4k rendering. It couldn't possibly be better. You could see the pores in Brad's neck when he was telling the Basterds what he expected of them. I couldn't have been happier with the movie... until the fire scene in the theatre. When the Nazi's were burning in the hell Shoshanna had created for them, ( the best scene in the movie) suddenly it froze! Nothing I tried worked, I fast-forwarded it, I tried to jump to the next scene, (just for the hell of it. I already made up my mind to send it back) went to the main menu to play the scene over again, it froze in the exact same place, and it doesn't even let you play the last scene. The show's over when it freezes up. I ordered another from a different seller. I let you know when I get it what happens. I'm going to the main menu right away and playing only that scene. Discs that are made in Mexico are often inferior. I saw one review that said the disc was made in Mexico. I wish I could figure out how to find if the disc was made there or not. I'll be back!",negative

250,Movies & TV,Blue Bloods: The Twelfth Season,$29.99,5,"In recent years, ""Blue Bloods"" has been forced to film its season finale without knowing if it would be renewed. In Season 12, the show spent a lot of time exploring everyone's options for the future. Will Frank Reagan finally retire? Will Erin run for District Attorney? Will Danny let one of his sons take up the family business, while developing a new relationship of his own? Will Jamie set his sights on higher rank? Will Eddie make sergeant? At season's end, some questions were answered, some were not.

Blue Bloods is still the best television show on Friday nights. A solid cast, consistent themes, and good writing have sustained the show. Season 12 is well recommended to fans of the series.",positive
251,Movies & TV,Yellowstone: The First Four Seasons [DVD],$52.50,5,"My wife and I kept hearing about the series Yellowstone, but never really watched it until it was about half way through season two. After we watched a couple of episodes, we were hooked. We continued to watch as much as we could, but kept missing some episodes. Finally, I got a little exasperated and decided we needed to follow the whole story of the Dutton family. Since ordering the First Four Seasons dvd's we have watched each episode at least twice and we are starting on our third go round. We are very much looking forward to Season Five. It is a fascinating series, although I would caution against allowing young people to watch it as there is some very explicit vulgar language and graphic violence. Kevin Costner and the entire cast are excellent. I would highly recommend this series. Just don't make me go Beth Dutton on you or have Rip take you to the Train Station.",positive
252,Movies & TV,Yellowstone: The First Four Seasons [DVD],$52.50,5,"This show is excellent. I had not watched Yellowstone, but my sister-in-law recommended it She said there is a lot of cursing and some violence, a little nudity, and lots of drinking, but it is well worth ignoring that to savor the beauty of the setting, the story, and the top-notch cast who portray the inhabitants of the fascinating realm of the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch. She was not wrong. This is the best show I have ever seen, no exaggeration. My previous best of, holy grail of TV greatness are Madmen and the Sopranos. But I have to say Yellowstone is superior.
Such tragedy and sacrifice and so many damaged people make this as real as it gets. I cry at least once during each episode, especially scenes like the corral dance and the porch scenes with Beth and Rip. It may not have been planned from the onset, but their relationship is the heart of the story. I sure hope we get an eventual happy ending with the ranch preserved and the two of them running it.
I started watching a bit when Paramount had a Father's Day marathon. Needless to say I did not get much done that weekend. I missed some of the story though, and am boycotting anything NBC, so I ordered these discs. God forbid when the show actually ends, but I am sure I will buy the complete series set as well. I hope it comes with an inflatable Rip Wheeler so ""I will never have to live another day without him""!

As to the disc set itself. It is fine. There is nothing fancy here, no booklet listing the episodes with a brief synopsis or cast pictures, etc. I have not watched all of the special features yet, but I do not remember seeing any bloopers or out takes, so there are no real extras. I would still highly recommend this set. If you do not already have the individual seasons, just buy this.",positive
