0,Appliances,Silonn Ice Maker,$95.39 - $140.62,5,"I just got mine yesterday earlier afternoon I let it sit like it says in the manual. For 24hrs. I then ran a cleaning cycle through it. I noticed that if you only fill it up to just before where it starts to dip on about a half inch below the fill line your Ice won't come out wet when you move the basket of ice to a bag for freezing it in the freezer. Also for those having trouble with the sensors in it if you take a Qtip an just put 1 end in Alcohol an gently wipe the sensors with it an then use the other end to dry them off. That will fix the problem. I use only jugs of Filtered Drinking water in mine you can get it at Wal-mart for a $1.08 a gallon. Mine has been making clear Ice since I started it an I plan on leaveing it on all the time. Only time will tell how long this machine will last hopefully a long time cause I have a small fridge an no room for Ice trays nor bags of Ice as for my drinks it keeps them nice an cold I use soda pop right out of the box an it gets cold thanks to the ice this machine makes real fast. So am really happy an will recommend this machine to any one who needs Ice but has no room for it like me.
Update: I have read all the Reviews regarding this machine an see many people complaning about the Ice not lasting very long in the basket an also about it coming out wet. If you have yours in the kitchen where a lot of heat is generated from the stove an other appliances then the heat is what is making the Ice melt real fast. My Ice maker is on the dinning room table away from the kitchen an the Ice doesn't melt very fast an I am making small Ice not big so the basket is filling up faster than I can use it but it is staying cold an unless I wait several hours it is not melting away my machine made a full basket in only 40 mins. an then stopped because the basket was full I took a nap an still woke up to it still saying it was full also the Ice doesn't melt very fast in my on the go tumbler I still have a 3/4 full of Ice after drinking all of my pop so if you want the Ice to last longer I suggest you move it out of the kitchen an put it somewhere that is away from any heat an you will be suprised at how long the Ice lasts.
Update: I have had this Ice Maker going nonstop for almost a week now an it is working great. I have found out that for people who are using it an then turning it off that everytime you turn it off an then on again that you are sending a surge through the system which shortens the life of the Ice Maker if you want it to last a long time that you need to let it run 24/7. I also have discovered that if you like fountain drinks like you buy at places like Mc. Donalds an convience stores it is best to use the small setting also the large setting is good for putting in coolers that you take when you go on picnics an camping to keep food an fish if you like going fishing to keep them fresh. Both small an large melt at the same rate I know this cause I have tried both in drinks. The Ice Maker keeps the Ice good over night I have mine running 24/7 an every morning wake up to 3/4 of the basket full of Ice. I believe it is because of where I have mine sitting away from any heat source. As soon as I can I am going to buy another one for the future an would highly recommend this Black Ice Maker to everyone just remember to leave it running 24/7 an it will last a long time. The Ice has been melting so slow that I have had to add water 3 times in just 1 week so those that have said that the ice melts to fast must have their Ice Maker next to a heat source cause the Ice does not melt fast enough to add to the water source to make more when it is not near a heat source. So the conclusion is if you want a lot of Ice an you want it to last place your Ice Maker in the dinning room or in the bathroom or some other room away from any sunlight or other source of heat. Also the Ice Maker keeps the Ice frozen just like as if it came from a fridge Freezer. An it is just as hard as if you took it out of one. I know cause I did a test to find out I love this little Ice Maker alot an I know if you follow my suggestions you will too.
Update: Well I have had it running nonstop 24/7 now for over a month an it is still working this is the best $108 I have ever spent. I have had no problems what so ever with it I just keep it full of water an it keeps making Ice for me I love this Ice Maker an have been telling my friends to get one cause it will save you alot of money on buying Ice from the stores.
Update well my Ice Maker is still going strong an is making this summer alot more enjoyable I just let it run all the time an scoop out Ice when I need it. Cause I only occasionally move the ice in the basket to make room for more in it by breaking up what little bit has started melting so it only runs when I do that so it is not being over worked which is why I think some are not lasting very long is cause they are being made to produce a full basket all the time instead of just a little an then getting a break bye letting some of the ice melt a little. I love my Ice maker an I will buy another 1 to put back for when this one finally quits.",positive
1,Appliances,Silonn Ice Maker,$95.39 - $140.62,5,"The first step was to give the machine a good initial cleaning, as instructed in the manual. The cleaning cycle completed after just a few minutes. Then, I added (bottled) water, replaced the basket, and pressed the “select” button for S(mall) or L(arge) “cubes”. (It would be more accurate to make the choices Small and Smaller, but L and S sounds better.) Once I selected L, the ice-making cycle began.
After a few minutes the first batch of ice got dumped into the tray, and another cycle began. That continues until the tray is full of ice or the machine runs out of water. In either case, the machine pauses until the problem is corrected. The best approach is to make sure neither of those things interrupts the process.
The machine itself is quiet enough, but I can easily hear the newborn ice “cubes” falling into the basket, even when I’m in another room watching tv. So, I just notice when I hear that sound, which tells me everything is working well. But every 45 minutes or so, I check on the machine, empty the tray, and check the water level. I don’t use the scoop at all. It’s easier to just lift out the tray and empty the ice into a 1-gallon plastic food storage bag. Each time I do that, I also drop the bag on the counter to break up the ice “cubes”, which tend to stick together into one giant ball of ice. Breaking up the “cubes” often prevents them from getting too welded together. (They aren’t really cubes at all; more like miniature test tubes.)
You can see through the translucent lid well enough. But, even better, you can lift the lid any time without interrupting the ice-making. You can also lift the basket out at any time, but you wouldn’t want to do that just as ice tubes are being emptied into it. (They would simply fall into the water and get recycled into new ice tubes. No damage, just wasted time.) So, it’s a good idea to wait until just after newborn ice tubes have tumbled into the basket, then empty the tray and add water if needed.
You would be very disappointed if you got the machine started, then left for work, then returned 8 hours later expecting a nice supply of ice tubes. It doesn’t take that long for the basket to get full, stop the ice-making, and start melting the ice tubes in the tray. You certainly don’t have to stay with the machine all the time, but you do need to give it your attention every 45 minutes or so. (Maybe an hour.)",positive
2,Appliances,Silonn Ice Maker,$95.39 - $140.62,5,"First thing, it's awesome. The ice tastes good, and the speed is nice, but there is an issue with the marketing. Ultimately, I'm returning it.

----Capacity----
The machine makes a total of one bowl of ice. Not a giant bowl of ice, no. The capacity is a cereal-sized bowl of ice. It will not make more than a cereal-sized bowl of ice until you empty it. So, unless there is only 1 person using the machine or you and whomever you're with will never use the ice at the same time, then you should be ok.

Some more perspective: I can fill two glasses full of ice and then the ice runs out.

---Melting Point---
Like all ice machine makers of this style, the ice does melt somewhat quickly but it's okay enough that it will not bother me. Also, it's soft enough to chew and enjoy, so that might contribute to the ice disappearing from my cup quite often.

---Energy/Run time---
Although I would expect the ice to melt all the time in the summer, it doesn't really. Since it's bunched with other ice, it sorta acts like an insulator. Albeit not the best insulator but the ice isn't melting as quickly as I imagined. Therefore, after it's full, I probably hear it make ice every 3-4 hours. Yesterday I was up all night and only heard it make ice twice during the very late hours.

---Size---
The height is about the length of my keyboard without the number pad. My number pad is detached.

---Overall---
If you meet the criteria I mentioned in the capacity header, don't second guess yourself and just buy it. This is seriously a good product. The ratings speak for themselves.

---Alternatives---
If you absolutely need a larger capacity machine, finding a good deal is risky. The GE opal is the next lineup that matches the quality and reputation of this machine. It's very pricey.",positive
3,Appliances,Silonn Ice Maker,$95.39 - $140.62,4,"UPDATE: 08/14/2022: My beloved icemaker is now emitting an oily yellow chemical into the water retaining basin. As you can imagine, I won't be using this icemaker again! Naturally, it happens when I'm just past my Amazon return window so I've contacted the manufacturer, Silonn for assistance with getting a replacement. I will update my review according to their response. I do hope it was just a defective item and they will send me a new one. I miss it already! I'm taking one star off for now but if they replace it promptly and the new one works I'll add back the star!

I've been looking at these for a while now since my new fridge didn't have an ice maker and I thought I could just use ice trays. TBH the ice trays just weren't for me. I work 3 jobs and I just don't have a lot of time to mess around with ice trays. I understand if you think that's stupid and if ice trays work for you, more power to you but they just didn't work for me. So, anyway, I've been looking at these countertop ice makers but they are so pricey and I just couldn't bring myself to hit ""place order"" on any of them. But I was going to have guests over for dinner and I wanted to have ice so I finally bought this one after researching about 50 of them. I LOVE it. I use it every single day and so does my daughter. I love having easy, quick access to ice without having to mess with ice trays. This machine is easy to refill, easy to clean and easy to operate. I've only used the small ice cubes and they are plenty large enough for me. It makes ice fast. It is a bit noisy but my kitchen is one of those kinda long ones so I just put it on the counter farthest from the living area and I really only hear it when I'm in the kitchen cooking and making noise anyway. If your kitchen is right near your living or sleeping areas it might be a problem for you but it's fine for me. I love it so much that I'm really kicking myself for not buying it sooner. If you are teetering on the edge of deciding to buy one and you see this review, buy it! It is worth every penny.",positive
4,Appliances,Silonn Ice Maker,$95.39 - $140.62,5,"We've had this ice maker for a few months and we're so happy with it. Here's the breakdown.

Pros:
-Fast: each cycle only takes a few minutes so you can have ice very quickly once you turn it on
-Reliable: it's worked perfectly for months and we use it often
-Easy to clean: the self-cleaning feature is great, and a removable plug in the bottom of the chamber makes it easy to drain any old water or cleaning liquid.
-Great ice texture: not too hard, can easily be crunched if desired

Cons:
-Sound, potentially: it's not noisy, but it's not silent either. You can hear it running, and the ice clatters a bit when a cycle is over, but it's not obtrusive in our opinion. But if you're noise sensitive, it might be too much for you.
-Wet ice: there's no refrigeration for the ice once it's made, so as it accumulates and fills the basket, it begins to sweat and slightly melt. This is solved by regularly emptying the basket while the ice maker is on, but it also means the ice likes to stick together once you put it in the freezer, because it was wet. If you use a bag for storage, dropping it against the counter breaks up the cubes easily, so we don't find this problematic, but other users have mentioned it as a downside, and just confirming that it's true--yes, the ice sticks together easily because it's wet when you put it away.

Overall we're very happy with our choice of ice maker and love the teal color we chose. It coordinates with our kitchen and doesn't take too much counterspace. We were previously making ice in trays and therefore used ice sparingly, but now we use it much more freely because we have ice in bulk at our fingertips. Excellent aid for staying hydrated and having ice available for other needs as well.",positive
5,Appliances,Silonn Ice Maker,$95.39 - $140.62,4,"For the value this is a great unit. I had never had before so there were a few things I didn’t realise that is not a reflection on this unit just these type of ice makers.
1) The capacity is not huge. To make a lot of ice you have to often empty the storage basket. I would say it fills about every hour roughly. So for lots of ice you need to transfer to a storage container in the freezer.
2) It doesn’t keep the ice frozen over a period of time. If left in the basket the ice melts and than is refrozen again through the process.
3) Due to the way the ice is made there is a hollow part to the ice. Therefore the ice does melt relatively quickly when added to liquid.
4) If you do want a lot of ice you need to empty the basket and refill the water frequently. This is not a set and forget overnight option for lots of ice. To make the 20 odd pounds of ice the adds all says these machines make a day you would need to recheck almost every hour, empty the basket and refill.
5) It is not super quiet. I wouldn't say it’s loud but definitely you hear it dropping ice if in a room nearby at night.
6) Because of the hollow centre of the ice I wouldn’t use this ice to fill a cooler for example if going out for a day trip. I would still purchase a bag of solid ice.
Overall still a great machine and I use it often (I turn it off and on allot to suit my ice demands) but just be aware of its limitations as a bulk ice maker.",positive
6,Appliances,Silonn Ice Maker,$95.39 - $140.62,5,"I took a chance on this ice machine because of the reviews. I am beyond happy with this purchase. Easy setup and had ice within 30 mins! This currently fits our needs. However, if you are looking for a machine that makes alot of ice at once then pick a larger capacity machine. This would work perfectly for dorm room or for those of us who don't use alot of ice. Again, it's quick to make ice but this machine would not be ideal if you were planning on using it for parties. It's compact and fits nicely on the countertop. It does make some sounds when dropping the ice into the bucket but it's minimal sounding (nothing loud and obnoxious). Our refrigerator ice machine doesn't work, and prior to that we went through alot of filters, which can be expensive. This ice machine has a cleaning push button. It makes large and small ice cubes.",positive
7,Appliances,Silonn Ice Maker,$95.39 - $140.62,4,"This makes bullet shaped ice cubes amazingly fast ... about 9 cubes every 6-10 minutes or so. The holding compartment is not refrigerated so the cubes will eventually melt. The melt water is collected and recycled into the next batch of ice in a continuous process. The process is stopped when the ice bucket reaches a maximum level.
This works extremely well, but the ice container is very small and will fill only about a 16oz glass full. While the claim of ""26# per day"" is probably accurate, you have to be there to empty the tray every time it gets full (and maybe every 30 minutes or so throughout the night!).
As such, don't expect to be able to fill your big ice cooler unless you're prepared to catch and store the ice as its being made.
When the ice bucket is full, the machine cycles on and off only rarely so the small amount of fan/compressor noise is tolerable.
Be patient when you receive it as it must sit unplugged for 24 hours after shipping.",positive
8,Appliances,Silonn Ice Maker,$95.39 - $140.62,5,"The color is awesome, first off. It makes ice quickly and efficiently. And yes, I am sure it can make 26 pounds of ice in 24 hours but remember that you have to empty the tray the ice lands in approximately once per hour. If you don't, it will stop making ice. Also, the ice will start melting if it is in the tray too long. So you need to keep your eye on it to make sure it doesn't stop making ice because the tray is too full or your ice melts. This is not a defect. It seems all countertop ice machines are this way.

In my experience, I can fill a gallon freezer bag (ziplock) in about 4-5 hours. Plan to empty the bin at least once per hour and put the ice straight into your drinks or freezer. I thought this machine would replace my need for buying large bags of ice for parties, but it would take days to achieve that, unless you stay up all day and night tending to the machine. So this machine, realistically, is for light, daily use. Plan on really stocking up on your ice or keep buying bags at the grocery store for large events.

Overall, this is a great machine, takes up little counter space, and makes great little ice cubes with minimal effort. I definitely recommend it. Thanks!",positive
9,Appliances,Silonn Ice Maker,$95.39 - $140.62,5,"*** IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS, SEE #3 BELOW ***

This is a great ice maker, but here are a few things to consider.

1. It is not an icebox, so any ice it makes will start melting after it is dispensed -- and because it's not cubed ice, I think it probably melts a little faster. The ice is stored in a little basket above the water tank, so it just recycles the melted water into new ice. The ice get a little wet and slushy the longer it sits, but fortunately this machine makes fresh ice quickly.
2. The ice accumulates in such a way that it usually triggers the ""ice basket is full"" sensor even though the basket isn't really full. So usually in the morning I'll open the lid and ""pull"" the stacked ice away from the sensor and into the basket so it will resume making ice immediately.
3. Cleaning the machine isn't difficult, but it's a little time-consuming. Here's how I do it. (A) Drain the water tank via the plug under the water tank. (B) Replace the plug and add 2 cups of vinegar and 2 cups of water to the water tank. (C) Start the cleaning cycle by pressing the ON/OFF/CLEAN button for 5 seconds -- the S / L lights will alternate blinking when the cleaning cycle is running. (D) Wait -- I haven't timed it but it seems like 20 or 30 minutes. (E) After the cleaning cycle has stopped, drain the water tank and refill with fresh water. (F) Run the cleaning cycle again so you don't end up with vinegar-tasting ice. (G) Drain once more before resuming making ice.

Again, none of these issues are deal-breakers. It makes ice quickly. We drink a lot of ice coffee in our house, so this machine is perfect. Just keep in mind it's not an icebox and needs occasional cleaning depending on your water quality.",positive

I love the shape, and ""crunchiness"" of the ice. Exactly what I wanted. What I wish I had known (although I love it anyway) is that it's not really a ""freezer."" Once the ice is made, if you don't use up the tray, the ice melts, and recycles to make another batch. (Which makes sense. I just thought that it would keep the ice bucket full, and then keep it frozen till I was ready to use it. Instead, if you don't use the ice that it makes immediately, it melts, and cycles again, over and over till you turn it off.) What I've been doing is turning it on when I get home from work, and use the ice during the evening, then turn it off. The noise doesn't bother me at all. It's also a nice sturdy machine. I would like the price point to be a teeny lower (or, would like a machine capable of making more ice at one time.)",positive

He's looked into it but can't see anything broken or how to fix, so we've ordered a new one. Should it have lasted more than 14 months? Yeah, probably.
But there's a decent coupon savings right now, so when you average that cost over another 12 months would we pay about $7 a month to have ice again? Yeah. But hopefully this next one lasts longer!",positive

It also melts super fast in a drink… faster than other ice cubes I’ve experienced. I dump a scoop into a room temp beverage and it’s gone within minutes.

It's also pretty quiet. I have had a few small issues with it. The light that indicates it needs water never really worked. It will keep running even when it is almost out of water and just produces ice chips when this happens. I have to refill it everyday to make sure this doesn't happen.

Worked great until it started smelling like burnt plastic!
We bought this for our travel trailer. So it does not gets used routinely, maybe 8-10 times over the past year. We have only used store bought purified water in it, no tap water. Drain the water and clean it out after we're finished.
Still makes ice but started smelling a burnt plastic smell this last time we used it. So of course unplugged it, drained it, and found the problem. The fan is not turning. So now I'm stuck with a $110 paper weight. Don't want to risk using it and having a fire.

My daughter got one for Mother's day and it's still working great. I've only had mine for a little less than a month but so far so good.

Pros:
- Not as noisy as I thought it would be. Very reasonable.
- Makes a full load in 4 to 5 hours (starts making quickly - maybe 15 minutes or so)
- Doesn't require a water hook-up (but has a hose to do so if needed). I use distilled water but water from filtered source (refrigerator) works find too.
- Ice can stay in unit for a while (not sure how long) but a small load will begin to melt.
- No other problems

Cons:
- Not really any major ones.
- Comes with a small plastic scoop. We bought a slightly larger metal scoop for the refrig.
- Some folks mentioned leaking. None here but the initial startup process will dump a little water at first which can get in the bottom of the ice basket. No biggie though.
- Ice was a tad smaller than I thought it would be but not so much of a problem.
- Unit is a little larger than I thought but easily fits beneath our cabinets.

Transferring the ice to our refrigerator leaves a slightly wet ice load. This freezes quickly so we open the refrigerator after 5 or ten minutes and shuffle the ice a bit to help keep it loose. Works fine.

This ice maker delivers! It is churning out so many delicious chewable nuggets! I waited on this for a while until the price came down, it is SO worth it! I haven’t tried the cleaning feature yet, but it seems easy. The instruction manual was short and sweet.

It was packaged really well - the inner box had a lift-off top and bottom, and it was well-wrapped in plastic and padded with styrofoam. There was a second outer manufacturer box as well, and then the third box was the Amazon outer shipping box. Arrived in perfect condition, except it was marked with an arrow to keep it upright, and Amazon packed it on its side.

A few notes if you’re still on the fence:
- It’s bigger than the stated dimensions, it’s 17 L x 17H x 10 W, so make sure you have enough counter space. It also has a fan on each side and the back and they suggest 6 inches clearance for those, so plan accordingly.I was going to put it against a wall on one side, but I didn’t for that reason.
- make sure you let it sit for two hours before you try it out. It’s to let the refrigerant settle. (Amazon packed it on its side…) I cheated and turned it on after only 90 minutes because I couldn’t wait, and it was much slower making ice the first day. Day 2 was much faster, which I attribute to my jumping the gun on day 1…
- it’s heavy. Really heavy. I had trouble getting it from my porch to inside the house because the outer box is HUGE. Be careful lifting it.
- it makes some noise. About what I would expect from a quiet dishwasher. My husband said “it’s an appliance with a motor, of course it makes noise.” The gentle sound of the nuggets dropping is music to my ears, though!
- it’s not a freezer. The ice will eventually melt and the water will be transformed into ice nuggets again. You’ll need to use it up or bag it for your freezer.

We have run about 3 gallons of water through it. However, there are a few things to note.
1) It is NOT a freezer. Once it makes the ice, the manual says to remove it to a freezer. Otherwise it just melts. It does insulate fairly well, though. I would put it on par with an average cooler.
2) It is HEAVY
3) The manual recommends draining and refilling any leftover water daily. This seems counterintuitive if it can be attached to a water line.
4) The ""cleaning"" mode doesn't seem to do a whole lot. The ad makes it look like it swirls, etc., but it just basically runs water through the system for a few minutes.
5) It shuts off too quickly saying the ice bin is full when it really isn't. The ice gets stacked up on the ramp to easily and blocks the sensors. I can move a small amount of ice from the ramp into the bin and it will start again. Also, once the auto-shutoff is activated, it will allow about half of what is in it melt before it starts making ice automatically again unless you open and close the lid. This may be by design since they want you to remove all the ice to a freezer.
6) I thought there was a light in it but there is not. That's an aesthetic thing to me and probably wouldn't bother most people.

I love this ice maker and the ice nuggets it makes. Making batches of ice does take some getting used to, simply for needing to remember to retrieve the ice before it melts and goes through the cycle again, but it's not really worth complaining about. When the water runs out to where no more ice can be made, you'll still have quite a bit of water left in the bottom of the machine. It took me longer than I'd like to admit that I realized you can empty that out using the tubing in the back of the unit into a pitcher (or sink, if close) vs manually sopping it up with paper towels.

After using it now for a full day here are my observations:

1. The ice maker is slightly larger and much heavier than I expected. When sitting on a kitchen counter it will have about 2"" of clearance from the bottom of the cabinet. My point is that this is not something that you just stick out of the way in the corner somewhere.

2. It is easy to use. I filled the hopper with about 3/4 of a gallon of distilled water and pressed the power button. The only other button is the cleaning button, so it really is idiot-proof.

3. It is somewhat slow to start making ice, it took about 20 minutes for the first pellets to start dropping and after an hour I had enough to fill a 8oz cup. It speeds up considerably after that and was making enough ice every hour to fill a 16oz cup. It took about 7 hours for the ""add water"" light to come on.

4. It makes some noise. It is about the same amount that my ultra quiet garbage disposal makes. The sound is similar to an air fryer by not nearly as loud. The noise it makes is easily tolerable considering how much joy the ice brings to everyone in my family.

Honestly, I ordered this one because it was the lowest priced one that I saw on Amazon. I figured if it didn't work as expected I could return it and spend the extra money for the GE Opal. I have only been using it for 1 day but it worked flawlessly so far. Time will tell if I made the right decision.

EDIT:
I have now been using this everyday all day long for almost 2-months now and it had functioned flawlessly so far. It SEEMS to have sped up considerably, though I do not know why or how other than I started filling it using the chilled water pitcher from the ""beverage center"" in my Samsung fridge. My wife and I both WFH and eat the ice all day long and it has no problem keeping up with our ice addiction.

The noise is tolerable and I do not really notice anymore until it shuts off. The noise it makes is very similar to the ""white noise"" machines that are in the exam rooms of my doctor's office.

My only ""complaint"" is that once it shuts itself due to a full ice bin it will not automatically start up again once the ice melts. I leave it on overnight and in the morning the ice bin is only half full. It will not start making more ice until I open the lid. This is the very definition of a ""first world problem"" but I just wanted to let people know that just because you leave it on 24-hours a day does not mean you will always have a full bin of ice.",positive

I understand why, but if you are expecting to just have it keep all the ice cold and ready, it doesn't work great at that. The ice continuously (slowly) melts and then it will make new ice. I've found that the best approach is when it gets full you just empty it into a large freezer bag and put it into the freezer for storage.

Has a large reservoir for water to keep making ice for a long time, and a handy drain at the bottom of the machine when you want it dry to store it. Simple to use. Pretty happy and felt it was a great deal.",positive

I then researched again and found this one. I can only tell you MY experience and hope that this helps you. I received it in a timely manner. I waited the time stated plus a little bit longer for it to sit before I used it. The machine is light enough to easily put on the countertop and move back and forth if need be, but I just leave mine there because it is small enough. I added water, turned it on, pushed the button for small ice (recommended on a review I read) and within 5 minutes I had ice! The noise is minimal and if I go in the other room I don't even hear it...maybe when the ice is being dropped. I did take off one point since it's not noiseless. As stated in other reviews, the ice maker ISN'T A FREEZER so you will need to put the ice in the freezer yourself or it will melt. The ice is firm but soft...not squishy. This machine is PERFECT for what I need and I can make a freezer bucket of ice in less than 30 minutes. It's super easy and convenient and I feel worth the price. I've had it over a month now with no issues and would recommend this product. I haven't used the clean button yet, but will do so soon and let you know if there are any issues. One other thing...the ice cubes do bunch together in the freezer, but I just give a little tap on the counter or with the shovel and it breaks apart easily. I hope this helps.",positive
72,Appliances,"Silonn Countertop Ice Cube Ice Makers, Self-Cleaning Ice Maker with Ice Scoop and Basket, Compact Ice Machine for Home Office Bar Party",$97.99 - $112.74,4,"My ice maker in my fridge broke about a year ago and I got tired of buying bags of ice that freeze and clump together in my ice bin.

This ice maker was on sale so I bought it. It’s super easy to use and the instructions are clear. Make sure to place the unit upright and in its permanent location for 24hrs before using so the freon settles.

The only reason give it 4 stars and not 5 is because you do have to dedicate at least 2 hrs to making a full round of ice since it makes 9 cubes every 9 minutes and the ice will melt if you don’t dump the tray in a timely manor (though I did forget once for about 40min and the ice was still good)!

I believe all of the ice makers take just as long to make ice so it’s not an issue with this specific one.

What I love most is the shape of the ice it makes. The cubes DONT clump or freeze together in my ice bin in the freezer! The cubes are way better than what my fridge made and what I buy at the corner stores.

I can make about half a bin of ice in just a few hours. So if you plan on making ice while your doing other chores it works out great. The maker doesn’t make a lot of noise either. I’ve had it now for a few months and it’s working great and has been an excellent purchase.",positive

I have to say it is very quiet, but I’ve had it running for quite some time now and I’ve got about seven or eight ice cubes, and I have it on the large setting and they are definitely not large! I even looked up YouTube videos to make sure I did it right and I followed step-by-step between the YouTube tutorials and the manual, But it keeps saying that it gets full when there’s only a couple of ice cubes. And they are melting while waiting for the next batch to come through, which isn’t even coming through. I’m really disappointed, especially since I really needed it this weekend.

After running several rounds, it actually started making ice. It’sbeen on for about 24 hours now, and I have about 2 lbs of ice. I’m happy about that, but I don’t see how it makes 27 lbs in 24 hours. I guess we’ll see.
So as far as my rating, I changed it to four dollars until I can see that it actually makes the amount that it says. It’s definitely very quiet. So I went from unhappy too happy.",positive

This would be great in your personal 'bar' for IMMEDIATE usage but is not really going to work as a IceMaker you can use for even a 12 hour period.
First it is not insulated (as it states in the instructions) and will NOT hold the ice (frozen) for ANY length of time.
Second, the Ice it creates has a lot of AIR which makes it freeze fast, but the physical quantity of 'frozen water' is not that much. This makes ANY style of this type of ice melt fast.
Third, when the water runs out, the unit shuts down. Meaning the bin of Ice will melt faster.
Let's say you were to leave it running 'unattended' expecting to have a bin full of ice a couple hours later: What would actually happen is it would make the first ""ice"" pretty quick and it starts to melt some. Ice would continue to be made and melt slightly until it ran out of water. At that point the Freezer shuts down,it warms up and the ice in the bin melts faster & faster. This thawed water will fall into the WATER RESERVOIR until it all melted and you would find it with no Ice, full of water and saying it needs water -OR- might restart and refreeze the thawed water, over & over again.
Also, the ice is really only good straight up; i.e. crushing or chipping would be marginal due to the air content.
LAST, I bought it to use in a true (commercial) ice shaver for a quickie snow cone without using every cube in the freezer and not having to wait or keep my freezer full of extra Ice Cubes. The ""ICE"" this unit creates will NOT work with a ""Shaver"" due to the AIR CONTENT.",positive

The ice tastes great when using purified water.

Cons- it takes a little longer than I had expected to make the ice…but this is no big deal to me as I don’t let my supply in my freezer drop below two large gallon size baggies.

Price is good for what it is
Quiet except for when it drops ice
Bullet is is not super hard, so if you are an ice cruncher like me, you'll like the ice it makes
Bullet ice has more surface area, so it cools drinks faster
Makes ice fairly fast

Cons:
stacks ice at the back of the basket where the sensor eye is, so you only get a half basket of ice before it stops. I push ice forward when I see it not running to get the basket full.

Does have a bit of a taste in the ice
Basket is small. Only holds enough for a couple of 12oz. glass fulls
Ice melts fairly quickly, which makes the machine run a lot.

77,Appliances,"Silonn Countertop Ice Cube Ice Makers, Self-Cleaning Ice Maker with Ice Scoop and Basket, Compact Ice Machine for Home Office Bar Party",$97.99 - $112.74,5,"So the fridge ice maker died and a repair visit was approximately 1/3 the cost of replacement. So I bought a countertop ice maker. This beast makes copious amounts of ice quickly and easily satisfies the needs of a family of four in the summer time, with a teen who fills every glass to the brim with ice. What keeps this device from perfection are two things. First, it's loud when it's making ice. Second, it needs attention from time to time throughout the day. The ice basket fills quickly and needs to be emptied into the freezer to keep making ice. Second, it's somewhat tedious refilling the water supply. It more or less takes a pitcher full of water with each reload. We have a filter-tap, so it takes a few minutes to draw a pitcher to fill this machine.

It arrived in perfect condition. Set up was easy. We used distilled water. The ice was CLEAR. It becomes a little cloudy when put in the freezer, but becomes clear again when liquid is poured around the ice cubes. The first ice came out in about seven minutes. Since the water recirculates and gets colder and colder, subsequent ice came out even faster and faster. The bin does not hold a lot of ice. And, it is only insulated. It is not refrigerated. So, I transferred the ice to a plastic box and put it in the freezer right away. I found out that if I didn't transfer the ice out of the maker until the bin was filled, the ice was a little wet and when I put it in the freezer, all the cubes stuck together. When I transferred the ice to the freezer pretty soon after it was made, I did not have any problem with the ice sticking together in large clumps. I found the sound level of the machine to be quite low. I expected it to be much louder. Over all, I would say this this ice maker is worth every penny.

80,Appliances,GE Profile Opal | Countertop Nugget Ice Maker | Portable Ice Machine Complete with Bluetooth Connectivity | Smart Home Kitchen Essentials | Stainless Steel Finish,$479.00 - $544.63,5,"My family is in love with this GE Profile Opal | Countertop Nugget Ice Maker.

We have a franchise fast food place called Sonic, which has always been famous for its soft, chewable, ice. They literally sell bags of their ice and we bought ice there for years. I was horrified when my nearby Sonic closed. So when my daughter called me to tell me that she had purchased this GE Opal and that it makes ""Sonic ice"", I knew I had to have one. Mt daughter was so tickled, she sent me an Amazon gift card as an early birthday gift to cover part of the price so I ordered.

It comes in a very protective shipping box with custom molded foam inside. Mine fortunately arrived in perfect condition but others have not been so lucky so I strongly suggest opening and inspecting it immediately so you can return if necessary.

Also note that if you live in a city with hard water, as I do, you need to order a filter to install before first use. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07518FM17/ It snaps into the bottom of the water well in the ice maker. You have to really push to get it in place but there is a definite snap when it's in place. You need to run the cleaning cycle before first use but it's easy to do. It is outlined well in the user's guide. Also, you need to wash out the side, water tank before first use. Then you are ready to make ice.

This ice maker is pretty big but it fit fine under my upper cabinets. The side tank attaches magnetically on either side of the ice maker so it's pretty flexible. It's quite attractive with crystal clear plastic and a brushed, stainless steel skin. It's also pretty heavy at 47lbs so you may need help to pick it up and put it in place.

You need to understand how these work. The unit is not refrigerated. It does not keep the ice frozen. Instead, it makes the ice, which falls into a clear, plastic, ice drawer. When the drawer gets full, you transfer the ice to a bag or bin and place it in your freezer. That is, if you aren't using it the minute it gets made. ;-) If you leave ice in the bin, it will slowly melt and the water goes back into the water well beneath the ice drawer and will be reused to make more ice.

It is also not plumbed and there is no option for a direct plumbed line. Instead, you fill the water tank and the side water tank manually so it has water to make ice. The side water tank holds enough water to make about 3 drawers full of ice. The machine can make up to 24 lbs of ice per day and the drawer holds about 3 lbs of ice. It's plenty for my big family and I do make and bag ice so I don't have to run the ice maker all the time. (These are the bags I buy and use: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00INV51ZM/)

It is very easy to use once you set it up. The user guide provides good, clear instructions for this. It's mostly making sure you have the correct water line attached to the side water tank. Once it's set up and clean, you set the switch in the back to ice and start making ice. There is an illuminated, round, touch sensitive, button on front. The lights surrounding the button tell you the status of the ice maker. It tells you when to empty the ice drawer, when to add water, and when it's making ice. There is also Bluetooth connectivity and an app for your phone which allows you to see the status of the ice maker and control it remotely. However, the permissions were too invasive, IMO, so I did not install the app.

Others have mentioned that their machine is too noisy but I don't find that at all. It's louder when the fan comes on initially but for the most part, it's just a quiet hum and the sound of ice falling into the drawer periodically.

Best of all, it makes that perfect ice we all love. It makes soft, chewable, small, nuggets. We are completely delighted with the quality of the ice. It also makes ice pretty fast. It's summer in Texas and we use a lot of ice and this machine keeps us in all the ice we can use. Do note that when you place the ice in the freezer for future use, it's not quite as soft as when it comes straight out of the ice maker and you do have to bang the bag of ice on the counter to break it up after it's been in the freezer. But it's still awesome.

Maintenance is weekly descaling with vinegar or a product GE makes for that purpose. I am using vinegar and it works fine. You also need to clean it with bleach to prevent mold on a regular basis but neither is a huge chore and again, the process is covered well in the user manual.

I am very pleased with this ice maker. It looks great on the counter. It makes perfect ice. The drawer is easy to pull out and empty or just pull out and scoop what you need. It's expensive, though. If you aren't a household that uses a lot of ice or enjoys chewing this special, soft, ice, I'm not sure it would be worth it. You can buy much less expensive, counter top, ice makers.",positive
81,Appliances,GE Profile Opal | Countertop Nugget Ice Maker | Portable Ice Machine Complete with Bluetooth Connectivity | Smart Home Kitchen Essentials | Stainless Steel Finish,$479.00 - $544.63,4,"Pros - the ice is amazing, the side water reservoir is needed and works great, it produces a good amount of ice daily, the machine looks nice and is well built, and the ice bucket with scoop is great

Cons - the noise the machine makes is very loud and annoying, the directions say to clean it every week or two and the process is involved and takes quite a bit of time, the machine is large and requires 3"" clearance all around it, adding the much needed water holder makes the space it takes up even more, the reservoir in the machine is too small to not have the water tank, the machine is very heavy and bulky, the price is quite high for a counter top ice maker, the ice melts in the container pretty quickly because it isn't insulated.

Initial setup requires an initial cleaning. It takes flushing the system with bleach water and then flushing the system with clean water 3 times. It is quite the process because the drain line isn't very long and the machine is bulky. The bad thing is that you are supposed to clean it every week or two. It is a major pain because I don't have space near the sink so I've moved it every time because a bucket doesn't work well either. The first time making ice it made a little and then melted it all multiple time. I'm not sure if something happened the first time, but I unplugged it over night. The next day I plugged it in and it worked.

The noise level is quite annoying for a product this expensive. It constantly runs a pump while making ice. It is very loud.

The ice is absolutley great though. Everyone loves the flavor and size. I use it every day and thoroughly enjoy the ice.",positive
82,Appliances,GE Profile Opal | Countertop Nugget Ice Maker | Portable Ice Machine Complete with Bluetooth Connectivity | Smart Home Kitchen Essentials | Stainless Steel Finish,$479.00 - $544.63,3,"This ice maker is a great value. It makes small ""nugget"" ice in reasonably large quantities. We had the optional side tank with ours and that is a very worthwhile addition. The TL;DR summary though is, this great product has a VERY short lifespan and even shorter warranty. If you buy it, get a good extended warranty and plan on having to replace it regularly
For a number of reasons we always filled our unit with distilled water. That prevented any scaling or odd tastes. Our unit worked flawlessly for about 18 months. We did all the recommended regular maintenance. Then it began to occasionally make a fan noise for a few seconds at a time and I expected the inexpensive condenser fan (which looks like a computer fan) was beginning to have bearing wear. That was not too concerning because the fan was visible through the back slots and looked like it would be simple to replace when needed.
Unfortunately at about 19 months it started an odd clicking occasionally. That continued and increased in volume and until it was grinding all the time. At this point it was clearly having gearbox problems and sounded like an old car grinding gears. After doing all the troubleshooting recommended by the manual, we began a search for other online info or service manuals, parts, etc. Nothing was available. Then we contacted Opal customer service. After going through a bit of their scripted questions, we got to discuss the unit and options. They could hear the unit grinding away in the background. Here are the options we were given:
1. The unit only has a one year warranty so nothing will be covered. We can prepay $250 (half-ish the cost of a new unit) and ship it to them. It weighs 47 lbs (22 kg) without any packing. The idea of packing and shipping damage free requires a lot of forethought. Even with this option if the cost of repair plus labor is greater than the $250 we would need to pay that too. If it was deemed irreparable we would get $125 of our $250 back.
2. Neither Opal or GE provide any repair or replacement parts, so getting it repaired another way is not officially possible. Since our unit has the strikingly familiar sound of broken plastic gears, my guess is that it will be a total loss without the ability to get new gears or a gearbox.
3. If we don't opt for the ship/repair gamble, we should just trash/recycle the unit and buy a new one.
I'm giving it 3 stars because it was great while it lasted and was a decent value. I am knocking off two stars for it being short lived, non-serviceable, landfill.
Since it is now junk, I plan to tear it down and do an autopsy. If a new part can be 3d printed or such, we may do that. Otherwise I think we will buy another one of these with the best, longest warranty I can find and even then plan on replacing it in a couple of years.

It made great ice, and plenty of it. I had so much trouble with it, I didnt even much care when it finally died. I had cleaned it according to instructions frequently, but it continually quit. I finally contacted the Opal manufacturer. They said it was still under warranty. I paid them a $300 deposit, and they sent me another one, with instructions to return my old one for a refund. That went well. I put new one in service a few months ago, and decided to use ONLY distilled water, as I think I had calcium build up on old unit. The new one has worked flawlessly all this time. I believe the difference is because I use distilled water. I highly recommend this for all users. I have a great water supply, but the Opal is very finicky.

I have opted to use only filtered drinking water in ours which my husband can’t stand but I want this thing to run as long as possible and we have pretty hard water. The noise is about the only thing that I can comment negatively on, it is loud but it’s an appliance so it’s not surprising and certainly something I will continue to look over because it’s worth it. You definitely want to make sure you use the drip tray, I tried to have it installed somewhere the drip tray didn’t fit and ended up having to move it because it does drip water every time you open it to get ice which again is annoying but not THAT annoying. I love that it shuts off on its own when it’s full and I definitely recommend getting the side tank so it will hold more water and help with having to refill it less often.

85,Appliances,GE Profile Opal | Countertop Nugget Ice Maker | Portable Ice Machine Complete with Bluetooth Connectivity | Smart Home Kitchen Essentials | Stainless Steel Finish,$479.00 - $544.63,4,"The ice it makes is excellent, and it makes plenty of it. It may fall short for a large gathering, but for 3-4 people it keeps up no problems.

It makes quite a bit of noise, and, as a counter top unit, that noise is projected all around the room, unlike a full-size refrigerator or a below-counter ice maker. Depending on the point in the cycle it goes from a noticeable, but not terrible amount of noise, to a loud whir and gurgle combination, to ridiculously loud screaming and grinding sound. When you get to the screaming phase, it needs water. It won't tell you it needs water for another 15 minutes, but it does, and it will quieten down once fed.

It also needs to expel a lot of hot air out one side, the hot air was expected, of course, it is a tiny freezer, but it's one-sided-ness was not. While facing the unit, the right-side rear is the air vent and you do not want to block this. I had to relocate things a bit once I discovered that.

I've had it going for 6 months now w/o issue, I use only RO filtered water in it, so no clogging or cleaning has been required. I have it on a schedule to run from about 8a to 10pm, and there's usually plenty of ice left if you need an 11pm drink. If power is lost to the unit for long enough, it will forget the schedule. WiFi would be better than BT, or at least BLE, the BT range is about 15', so it's only good for setting the schedules. WiFi ( and homeKit and/or an API ) would be a worthwhile upgrade, but hardly necessary.

I did not get the external tank, will probably try to plumb it to the filtered water tap now that it's worked through at least some of the warranty -- as that will void the warranty. If you have more than a couple of people using it, the external tank is probably worthwhile, though expensive for what it is...",positive

I bought some empty ice bags and fill them up and store them in the freezer for days where we go to the lake or if we are going to be at the ballpark all day. I think the unit is a little pricey. Would be nice if the price was more affordable. Also, where we live we have hard water so I have to clean the unit every couple weeks. Cleaning is pretty simple.

87,Appliances,GE Profile Opal | Countertop Nugget Ice Maker | Portable Ice Machine Complete with Bluetooth Connectivity | Smart Home Kitchen Essentials | Stainless Steel Finish,$479.00 - $544.63,4,"Purchased this for my wife for Christmas when it was on sale for Black Friday. Received the machine on Dec. 5th but wasn't able to set it up until the 25th. Suffice to say my reading of the reviews of the machine (despite its 4.5 stars) I am still wary of the life of the machine but have double the manufacturer's warranty so was willing to take the gamble despite its high price.

I fully read the manual (not just the quickstart guide) and followed all the instructions and flushed the machine prior to putting it into use.
2 weeks in we have used it daily for about 8-12 hours per day only using Distilled Water. About 4 of the supplied scoop fills a large Stainless steel Yeti type tumbler and 2 scoops for a standard 16oz glass. It takes about 5 hours for the compartment to completely fill the bin with ice from empty, and the reservoir holds about 1/2gal of water to the top fill line.

Things to Note:
1) Reviews with complaints mentioned loud noises....we havent had any and the machine runs quietly. The noise level rises once the reservoir is nearing empty.
2) The manual says the indicator light has a raindrop effect when making ice but it is VERY VERY subtle....almost barely noticeable. Until I really looked at it, I thought the light was just a solid white.
3) DOWNLOAD the OPAL App to unlock the scheduling features for the machine to turn off / on automatically daily and to turn the machine on/off remotely. You are also able to lower the brightness of the indicator light to a Nightlight setting.
4) With our daily usage of about 8-12 hours per day, we have needed ~ 4 Gallons of Distilled Water / week = $ 3.52/week
5) The Bin will stop making ice (Solid white light) when it is FULL.....but that means REALLY FULL with Ice filling the window
6) I've experienced when remotely turning the ice making on/off via bluetooth, that sometimes the machine gets 'stuck' and continues making ice even though it says it is stopped. It doesn't respond to any button pushes or bluetooth commands so you have to manually unplug the machine for 20sec and then plug it back in.
7) Install the machine as instucted with 3""+ of space on the sides and the back. As it is an ice maker it exhausts heat. It sucks in air from the left side and expels the heat out the right side. Plenty of clearance allows the machine to work its best.

So...so far so good. The ice is great and between the my wife and I the amount of ice it provides is perfect per day. We haven't run a cleaning cycle yet as we are using only distilled water and will probably do that every 2 weeks vs the recommended 1x per week. I will update my review as the year progresses and hope that the build of the machine has improved versus earlier in its lifespan.

Update : 12 Weeks Later
Everything is working great so far.......We start it usually mid-morning and it runs about 12 hours / day.
It does stop making ice when it registers the basket as full so it isn't running the entire time. We are still averaging about 4 gallons of distilled water per week (~ $2.96 as we get it for .74/gallon).

Performed only our 2nd cleaning as the use of Distilled Water allows for cleaning not as often (experienced owners said 3 months so that's what ive set it for) and we have had no variances in taste or production or quality in the ice. Also using distilled you don't have to worry about buildups or deposits or flushing with vinegar.

We still use a diluted bleach solution just in case for disinfecting but as nothing but distilled has only been used in the machine we aren't too worried about bacteria or growths of any sort.

Will post another update in 3 months.",positive

After the first day, my unit started making those noises and I was very concerned. I realized that the water reservoir had run dry (I had not yet installed the water tank). It starte making the noises again and I suspected that it was due to the heat that the unit puts out. I had this on my counter with a cabinet over top and right next to the fridge. I moved it out to the edge of the counter, made sure there was nothing on either side, and started it back up and did not have a problem after that. I have since installed the water tank and put the unit on a counter with nothing over the top and nothing on either side and it has been running perfectly. It is not silent by any means, it has compressor noise, motors, and ice dropping into the bin; however, the aweful noises others have had seem to be avoidable with a little care.",positive

100,Appliances,"FRIGIDAIRE EFIC189-Silver Compact Ice Maker, 26 lb per Day, Silver (Packaging May Vary)",$124.50,5,"We are always running out of ice and this has solved the problem. I wish I would have bought this a long time ago.

This ice maker is excellent and will delivery the 26 lbs. of ice per day. What a lot of people don't understand about countertop ice makers is that when the ice is made it is about 27 degrees and the ice maker is not a storage freezer. Think of it like the ice that was just made will sit in the ice maker which is like keeping ice in a cooler. It won't get colder it will just slowly melt and then gets turned back into ice again.

Keep in mind when you pull ice out of your kitchen freezer that has been in there for several hours it is around 0 degrees vs. the 27 degrees right out of the countertop ice maker. So, ice from your freezer is going to last a lot longer in a drink than ice out of this countertop ice maker. So, that may not be ideal for some if you are having a drink outside on a hot day and not using an insulated cup. For best results take the ice out of the countertop ice maker and put it in a gallon ziplock bag and place it in the freezer for a little while so it will get down to the 0 degrees. That is not necessary though. The ice that comes right out of the machine is plenty cold enough for drinking beverages indoors. If you want to use the ice outdoors just place the ice in an insulated cup.

Pros:
Very quality built machine.
Very easy to use.
It uses lights to notify you of the status rather than annoying beeps.
It really does make 26 lbs. of ice in an hour.
First ice in about 8 minutes.
Full basket of ice in about an hour.
Pauses itself when ice basket is full and will resume ice production automatically as soon as some ice is removed.
Light comes on when water needs to be added (keep in mind you still have a full basket of ice when this triggers).
Melts very slowly and if you leave it on over night it only comes on once or twice to replace the ice that melted.
Quite operation.
It doesn't take up a lot of countertop space so we are able to leave it out and it matches our stainless steel fridge.
It comes with a nice ice scoop which is great for parties.
This ice maker keeps dropping ice every 8 minutes.
The cord is very long so it doesn't have to be right up against the outlet.

Cons:
The only con I have about the machine is trying to drain the water remaining when you are done using it. There is a drain plug underneath it that is a little tricky to use because you can't see underneath the machine and you can't just turn the machine upside down to drain it per their instructions. That will harm the machine.

What I found to be a great solution is instead of using the drain plug I use a microfiber towel to soak up all the water left in the machine. That only takes a quick second and you don't have to move the ice maker over the sink to drain it. I then leave the lid open to make sure it dries out. So it really isn't a con if you use the microfiber towel. It is so easy this way which means I never mind using the machine even to make a small amount of ice.",positive
101,Appliances,"FRIGIDAIRE EFIC189-Silver Compact Ice Maker, 26 lb per Day, Silver (Packaging May Vary)",$124.50,4,"While I have a newer fridge with the fancy built in ice machine, I also have a husband that doesn’t usually finish the projects promised (such as adding the water hookup). I myself am not at all verses in any area of plumbing, so me attempting would undoubtedly lead to the need for fixes, which like projects, never seem to get finished. That being said, this little gadget has come in pretty handy!

While I could just have gotten ice trays for a fraction of the price, (A) I’m inpatient and don’t want to wait the eternity for those to freeze and (B) don’t always/ever want the huge ice cubes in my drinks. I know, there are smaller ones, but been there, tried them, still took too long when I finally remembered to refill the trays. Anyways, on the the important pro/con list:

Pro:
- 2 sizes, both same shape, just slightly different in size
- small enough to keep on the counter without being in the way.
- first batch comes out pretty quickly, and follow-up batches don’t take too long either.
- plug under the fill area, so you can empty it once done without having to turn whole machine upside down (or leave it in there to get gross)
- kids love watching the little arm push the ice into the bucket once frozen

Neutrals:
- water reservoir doesn’t hold much, so you need to refill frequently if you are constantly making ice
- ice basket is also smaller so needs to be emptied frequently as ice is produced
-machine doesn’t get super cold, so ice can sweat, which will lead to it sticking together a bit of you move to freezer after

Cons:
-cleaning looks like it could be an issue, unless you have really tiny hands to get in all the tight spots

Considering the size and cost of it, I would definitely recommend.",positive
102,Appliances,"FRIGIDAIRE EFIC189-Silver Compact Ice Maker, 26 lb per Day, Silver (Packaging May Vary)",$124.50,4,"I've owned this for a week now. here's my take on it. If you can swing by once an hour to empty the hopper into a container in your freezer, it's great. That said, if you don't have time to sit and babysit this bad boy, the ice in the hopper will melt and you have to start back over and wait awhile to get ice. I'm in construction in Texas.. its freaking hot here like anywhere else in the summer. I use a ton of ice in my water jug and the cooler. every night when I get home I have to set a timer for 1 hour and just swing by and empty the hopper and fill the water reservoir, until I go to bed in order to have enough ice for the next day. On my day(s) off I'll try and spend as much time filling up bags of ice. I bought myself a box of 8lb bag ice bags. In a week, I'm up to three 8lb bags, of reserve ice. I'm not sure how anyone claims this can do 26lbs in 24hrs. Realistically... 9 cubes, every 7 minutes... the hopper holds 9 rounds... 81 cubes. It takes an hour to do that. You can math it from there.... Final take... for $130 and not having to wait on conventional ice trays it's worth the money, IF you have the patience. 😊 it's not loud while it's running, and it's pretty easy to use. just have to babysit it.",positive

I kept buying bags of ice and putting them in the deep freezer but it got really expensive at $4.50 a bag every few days. We work out in the heat so have to have a cooler of ice and drinks with us every day. I purchased this and it will make a gallon bag of ice in a few hours. Really every 13 minutes it makes a glass full. The only thing I don’t like is that you have to keep an eye on it as when the tray gets full, it shuts off so if you need to make loads of ice, you have to babysit it all day. other than that, it is a lifesaver for when your refrigerator and freezer tear down or if you have lots of company on holidays, you can always use this to have extra ice.",positive

Our refrigerator is great at a lot of things...but making ice in quantity is not one of them. Every evening, it seemed that we'd run out of ice after an hour or two. In comes this machine and...the problem with lack of ice has been solved!

I turn it on about an hour before we need ice, and within that hour, there's about enough ice to fill a quart size bottle. In order to make more ice, you either have to let the old ice melt (the lid is not sealed, so the old ice will melt over time) or add more water. I'm still not sure where the 26 pounds of ice measurement was made...maybe if you took out the ice each time it's made and keep the water level up, but regardless, it makes enough where we don't lack for ice.",positive

It makes 2 different sizes and the cubes have a small hole in the center (you'll see why once it's made). The hole actually helps the ice from not being too hard and busting your teeth. It's really simple and refills quickly. The only thing I was surprised about was that it doesn't keep the ice cold, it's not refrigerated. It collects the ice made in a small basket that sits over the water supply. If not used it will melt and drain right back into the supply water.

It is not like making ice in your freezer. The unit only cools when it is making ice. The cubes drop into an ice bucket and at that point it's not much different from a cooler. Gradually the ice melts and the water is returned to the reservoir. Eventually the machine will refill the ice bucket when the cubes at the bottom have melted down enough that there is room for more ice to go in at the top. Also, the ice that comes out of your freezer will probably be around 0 degrees Fahrenheit.

The side water tank (if you get the model with the tank) only needs to be refilled every day or so. You can connect the ice maker to the internet (possible security issue) with the GE app and turn it on when you leave work so you have ice when you get home. The ice hopper allows the water from the melting ice to drain back into the reservoir so it can be used to make ice again.

If you’re looking for ice that’s gonna be perfectly clear coming out of the machine this is not the maker for you.

With those two statements out of the way this ice machine works amazingly. The cleaning can get tedious if you don’t use distilled water. If you have a whole house soft water set up that may work well, but soft water and a deionizer still has the system needing to be cleaned more often than I would like. Distilled water seems to have no buildup whatsoever in the system and we’ve yet to see it need a cleaning even though I’ve run the cleaning just in case.

We called for service, and they said they'd come in 5 days. Only trouble is: We had hundreds of dollars of food, including grass-fed beef, in the fridge.

It's not especially fast (9 cubes the shape and size of the tip joint of my thumb every 8 minutes, as claimed). And it has no refrigeration, so if it's hot in the room, the cubes will eventually start to melt back into the water reservoir to make new cubes. But it did its thing, chugging along reliably and keeping us supplied with cooler ice all day.

I hope our fridge never breaks again but it's good to know I have this little marvel ready if it does. And it's also great for get-togethers. You can make a bunch of ice ahead of time and put it in the freezer. My freezer has an icemaker but sometimes it's just not enough.

I also love this ice because I use a fancy water filter for my drinking water, so when I pour it into the ice maker, I know it's pure. When you get ice from the store, you never know how pure it is or how clean their facilities are. With this ice, I *know* it's clean and pure.",positive

141,Appliances,"Frigidaire Portable Compact Maker, Black Stainless Steel Ice Making Machine",$108.00 - $265.80,4,"This little appliance puts off a lot of heat. Running it for an hour raised the room's temp by about 4 degrees.

How It Works
For efficiency, it needs to make a few batches of ice and fill the basket. Water flows over metal fingers until the ice forms. Then it shifts and the cubes drop before a little pusher gate nudges it into basket. There's a slight ""clunk"" sound when the ice drops and again when it hits the basket.

It takes forever if you scoop the ice as it releases bc the reservoir gets warm when you open the lid. The first batch or two of ice sits in the basket melting and dripping back into the water reservoir. The water cools and more cold air accumulates in the unit as it runs. It takes a while to get going.

The ice is kind of soft and will melt as it sits in the basket. I let it make a basket full and the transfer the ice into a container in the freezer.

Ice Output
It took about 15 minutes to freeze the first batch and then worked a little better as the water became cooler. The small ice was just too melty and not worth making. The larger pieces were okay, but they also melted easily since there is a partial tunnel in each piece of ice. It cools drinks fine, but I had to use more ice to compensate.

Value
For the price, it's pretty okay. Mine arrived with a tiny dent in the surface. There's a small rubber stopper on the bottom of the machine. It's kind of awkward to empty any excess water and the stopper feels finnicky. Upgrading to a better machine would be 3 or 4 times the price.",positive

Update: have had it a month. Been working well. Still makes ice but the power button is flashing green continuously when I power off. No ice is stuck in it. Any ideas why? I have unplugged it to see if it would reset but still flashes green. Still makes ice and works good though.",positive
150,Appliances,Euhomy Ice Maker Portable Ice Makers,$139.99 - $149.99,5,"Works for us. Our frig doesn't have ice maker. Big bags of store bought ice or a bunch of trays takes up too much freezer space.
This takes up quite a bit of counter space as it has to have about 8 inches around it to work properly.
Can make up ice to stock up, then store off counter. We may move it to laundry room.
Took 1 star off for noise. It's fine except when the cubes are released into the bin. They clatter. We turn it off at night.
Took 1 star off for easy to use. Since this ice maker doesn't keep the ice cold, you have to either use it or let melt and machine remakes the ice. Or put ice in bags to store in freezer. So, it makes about 10 cubes every 6-8 minutes. If you don't pull the cubes to bag and freeze until the bin is full, the first cubes can be a bit melted. I leave it on to make ice when when I can multi task in the kitchen, stopping every 6 min to gather the cubes, bag them. Once a gallon size bag is full, the machine is off & tucked away.
For a party, it's great to make ice up ahead to start, and let it crank away for your guests.
Not sure why Flavor is a rating point. The ice tastes as good as the water put in it. We use filtered.
You Can Not put other liquids in it without potentially ruining the machine.",positive
151,Appliances,Euhomy Ice Maker Portable Ice Makers,$139.99 - $149.99,4,"I bought this ice machine 2 years ago. I find myself back on Amazon today weighing pros and cons to replace it as I have broken the basket loading mechanism while trying to clean the dang thing.

Pros:
Standard rate of making ice
Relatively quiet
Relatively small amount of counter space

Cons:
CLEANING! - I didn't even know this was supposed to be self cleaning - there are no instructions or buttons for this, and the Euhomy youtube video on cleaning says that you need to clean by hand. (PS. they advise to clean every 3-7 days)
It is clunky and awkward to clean - as you would expect any ice machine to be. However, the moving basket that scoops the water that forms the ice is impossible to access, and thus impossible to clean. I thought I had been cleaning it ok but recently caught a glimpse of how filthy it was and (after gagging with how gross it was and wondering how dangerous the bacteria I have been ingesting was), ended up breaking the whole machine trying to access it. There may be a way to dissemble the whole machine with tools and do it more delicately, but I wish this area had a hinged door to access the basket.

I however am back looking at possibly repurchasing this same unit as it seems that this is a common problem with these types of ice machines, and liked the machine otherwise. Maybe I can be more gentle and creative with cleaning the new one?",positive
152,Appliances,Euhomy Ice Maker Portable Ice Makers,$139.99 - $149.99,5,"I was miserable last summer visiting my daughter in NYC because her tiny refrigerator’s freezer couldn’t fit regular ice trays, and we couldn’t keep up with the amount and speed of ice we needed, so this year, I bought her the EUHOMY ice maker after reading tons of reviews and then choosing based on those reviews and price (I didn’t want to spend a ton of $ if it wouldn’t last). It's the perfect countertop size. We’ve been using it for a week now, and we love it! Ice in just minutes! And I have the routine down now for storing ice, too! I bought gallon-size Ziploc sliding-close freezer bags, and when the ice basket is full, I empty the basket into a Ziploc bag and put it in the freezer flat (a 1-gallon sliding-close Ziploc freezer bag can hold two full baskets of ice). Then, when we need it, we can take out a bag, drop it flat on the tile floor to separate the bullets of ice, then stand it on its bottom end and slide zip it open to take out what we need, then pop it back in the freezer until the next time we need ice! Tip on Ziploc freezer bag type: slide-ziploc bags work great, the pull-apart Ziploc bags tear. This ice maker makes perfect, fabulous tasting ice! It's important to remember the ice maker is not a freezer, so you'll need to use the ice as it's made, freeze it for future use, or use it to fill up an ice chest. No worries if the ice melts in the basket while making ice because it will just be recycled to make more ice. Great for having friends over when ice is constantly needed! The noise level is no big deal, it sounds about as loud as my refrigerator ice maker at home. We use water filtered with a Pur faucet mount water filter, and the whole process is easy breezy! Love this little machine and I hope it lasts for years and years!",positive

For the price point we figured if it worked half as well as others said we would be happy. set-up was easy, and maintaining is just as easy. It is an ice maker, not a freezer. Ice will melt after awhile if you just leave it in the machine without it on. Since we needed so much ice we started emptying the ice into a cooler for later use. We basically ran this thing almost 20 hours a day for a month. it worked PERFECT! Surgery was beginning of April 2022, it is now mid July and we still use it every day for drinks and cocktails. We start it in the morning and let it run all day so we have ice water, and then cold drinks in the evening. Even for parties it seemed to make enough ice.

Took the tray out and still had 2/3 rds of water in it. I was surprised to see that. Figured it would use all the water but didn't. Very good on consumption.

157,Appliances,Euhomy Ice Maker Portable Ice Makers,$139.99 - $149.99,4,"Because the cubes are damp when made, you will find they clump together once placed in the freezer for later use. We need to chop them apart when first removed from our freezer. After the first separation, they tend to stay separated. The cubes are smaller than refrigerator/freezer ice makers and until first freezer storage, are also delicate.

160,Appliances,Gevi Household Countertop Nugget Ice Maker GIMN-1102,$459.98 - $499.99,5,"Better than the GE opal icemaker that only lasted two years.

Now for folders closure, only received this on Thursday of this week. Do not have a lot of experience with this icemaker other than to say, it arrived on time, big dent in the left side, but otherwise in good condition and working.

This was easy to unboxed no assembly required, and after sitting for two hours was able to turn it on and make ice in about 20 minutes. Fall basket in about three hours.

Ice is pretty much identical to the GE opal, except maybe this is a little bit harder, but makes a swell cocktail.

Since I’ve only had it for a couple of days, cannot rave too much about it with such a little amount of experience, but it does seem to make ice faster than the GE. You can tell that the ice bin is insulated, and it does keep the ice frozen overnight a lot better than the GE. The access door actually has a double pane of plastic for insulation which helps a lot.

Even though this comes with a connecting line probably about 6 feet, I probably am still going to do it manually because it’s so easy to take the ben out and fill it with water.

A word of caution, if you have purchased the GE Opal, I would certainly recommend going to the website and purchasing the five-year extended warranty I think it’s $99. I did this not trusting this new machine, and I’m glad I did because the GE operated for about a year and a half before it died. That’s a lot of dollars for a year and a half of ice. warranty was through Allstate, took me five days, from my report to receiving a check in the mail, could not be more pleased.",positive
161,Appliances,Gevi Household Countertop Nugget Ice Maker GIMN-1102,$459.98 - $499.99,5,"I have only had this a few days but love it so far! I opted for this machine instead of the Opal Because that one had some questionable reviews as far as customer service was concerned. This was a bit cheaper too. It is super easy to use and clean. I don’t love the white and would prefer if it were black or stainless to match my other appliances, but that was not available. It makes ice regularly and the ice is the kind of ice that kind of compresses with a good bite to it when you bite into it. I do wish it held more water but it is easy enough to fill. To fill, you just pull the ice basket out and add water to the fill line. Easy peasy! It does make noise but it is pretty quiet and I seldom notice, kind of a very low hum. My favorite thing to use with the ice is iced coffee. I fill my cup with ice, add my coffee , creamer and cinnamon and nutmeg and stir. It is instantly cold and delicious. Also, when I make fresh iced tea, I start by adding sugar to my pitcher, then some water and slosh it around to dissolve. Then, I add tons of the ice and pour my hot tea over the ice, top with water and it is so good! If you aren’t doing your sweet tea this way, try it, it does make a difference in how sweet it tastes and the flavor. Having a farm, we work outside a lot and I can see where we will get so much use out of this ice maker. Also, once you’ve taken some of the ice out, if you push the ice to the front of the machine it will make even more because the sensors think there is less ice than when it is all in the basket evenly.

162,Appliances,Gevi Household Countertop Nugget Ice Maker GIMN-1102,$459.98 - $499.99,4,"We have been using our ice machine about 3 weeks. So far we love it. I did purchase the Amazon appliance warranty with it just in case because some reviews made me nervous. I researched the nugget machines a lot before I decided to try this one.
My negative is this-we researched how to split the water line from the fridge to the machine and add the filter. We were ready to hook it up that way when it came in. However, the machine was about an inch too tall to fit on my counter because it hit my top cabinets and kept the door from opening. I didn’t measure so probably my fault. I’m not sure if our cabinets are standard or what but I do suggest measuring the space you have in mind first. We had to move it to the bar and are filling it manually. The noise is a little more noticeable but it’s out in the open. It isn’t unbearable but you definitely know when it’s running.
My positive-it is easy to use. My 6 year old fills it and can help herself to ice whenever. The ice is great and we are loving the machine overall. We’re hoping it holds up to daily use because we are definitely hooked on the good ice now!",positive
163,Appliances,Gevi Household Countertop Nugget Ice Maker GIMN-1102,$459.98 - $499.99,5,"If you travel around to find that perfect ice at local gas stations or restaurants this ice maker is for you! Hands down the best I’ve ever had! Great tasting and is excellent by itself (soft crunch) or lasts in favorite summer drinks. I don’t regret this purchase as I no longer have to leave the house to hunt down a perfect cup of ice. We use distilled water but it has the option to hook up to water line. It’s very easy to use and matches our kitchen. The noise level is not horrible but that would be the only thing I would have to say negative. Again, it’s not horrible but I was surprised at the sound the first time in operation. Kind of like a dishwasher running. The ice dispense is very quiet. Again, perfect solution for the perfect cup of ice right from home! Very reasonably priced in comparison to others I reviewed. I’d buy this brand again!",positive
164,Appliances,Gevi Household Countertop Nugget Ice Maker GIMN-1102,$459.98 - $499.99,4,"While I did have some issues with my first one of these (pump was not working correctly, so it kept shutting off after making only a tiny bit of ice), and the Amazon return process was a bit of a hassle, the replacement I ordered has been installed and working for several days now, and I'm really pleased with the output of ice. We go through ice pretty quickly in our house (~2 bags of Sonic ice a week), and this machine is not only keeping up with demand, but also making enough ice that we have been able to dump a couple of trays' worth into a container in the freezer as a backup. Since I had issues with my first one, I got to mess around with the cleaning cycle and draining process quite a bit, as well removing and replacing the reservoir filter. Overall, I'm pleased with how easy to use this machine is, and barring any additional issues with the new one, it seems like it should be fairly low-maintenance over the long term.

I managed to buy my replacement ice maker on Prime Day, and ended up saving another ~$40, so I guess that helped offset the inconvenience of having to repack the malfunctioning one and go through the return process. Honestly though, I'd have been happier if the first one had just worked properly. If not for the issues with the first one, I'd have given it five stars.",positive
165,Appliances,Gevi Household Countertop Nugget Ice Maker GIMN-1102,$459.98 - $499.99,4,"We've had this unit for almost 3 weeks. Besides the positive reviews the reason I went with the model is because you could run a water line directly into the back of the ice maker. I just tapped into my water line going to my refrigerator and put a cut-off valve right behind it.

The unit is a little noisy when making ice....but not too bad. It makes ice quickly and is just like Sonic ice!

The only problem I've had is when I leave the cut-off valve open and the unit goes to refill automatically it never stops and fills up all the way to the top and melts all the ice inside. I've contacted the manufacturer and they are replacing it for me so we will see if the next unit works as it should.

Besides the water line issue we've been more than happy with this ice maker.",positive
166,Appliances,Gevi Household Countertop Nugget Ice Maker GIMN-1102,$459.98 - $499.99,5,"The GEVI ice maker makes delicious soft crunchy ice. Comparing it to Chic-Fil-a Ice, I’d wager the GEVI ice is as good or better. My only real complaint about the unit is the size. It is unnecessarily tall. In-fact, It is about 1/2” too tall to fit under my upper cabinets while set on my counter top. I wish they had a shorter version.

We use filtered+ RO water in the unit and the ice always tastes delicious and there is no visible debris or residue added to the water from the ice.

Once we determine a suitable final location for the GEVI unit I plan to plum it with a water line and drain. Will plan to update this review accordingly",positive
167,Appliances,Gevi Household Countertop Nugget Ice Maker GIMN-1102,$459.98 - $499.99,4,"I am not sure how ""clean"" the cleaning cycle gets it since there is only a trickle of water coming through the output when it runs, bit so far I have made a lot of ice and it has been keeping up with our usage no problem. We used to buy bags of Chic-Fil-A ice and would go through about 3 a week. This has no issues pumping out the ice.

I did buy a water filter for it, but I am not real sure I am going to hook it up since we can just pour the filtered fridge water into it.

1 con on this is that it doesn't allow you to turn it off. There is only a mode where the ice making is paused, but the power button only switches between pause and go, never power off. So i need to unplug it in times where it isn't going to be used. The only other issues is that after cleaning to drain out the cleaning fluid you have to basically remove it from where it is so you can unhook the drain hoses from the back and drain it into the sink.",positive
168,Appliances,Gevi Household Countertop Nugget Ice Maker GIMN-1102,$459.98 - $499.99,5,"We love ice, it's been a nuisance living in an apartment with a fridge that has no ice maker and a small freezer.

The unit arrived and had a major dent in the box which caused some concern but they pack these so well that there was no damage to the unit.

It truly is important to let the unit rest for at least 2 hours in an upright position given the Compressor and its fluid. After waiting through the grueling period we followed the setup instructions and filled it with our Clearly Filtered water (10/10 as well). The unit has a mild humm while working and the initial run took a while to get moving. We had our first splattered soft ice cylinder in about 20 minutes, however the unit begins working much faster once moving.

It has great features like the auto standby when the basket is full and the insulated basket keeps the ice stable for hours. It then recirculates any melted water to create new ice.

It's efficient, makes the best ice around, quiet, and great quality. I'd highly recommend it if you're tired of ice trays or picking up bags from the market.",positive
169,Appliances,Gevi Household Countertop Nugget Ice Maker GIMN-1102,$459.98 - $499.99,5,"So I've had this nugget ice maker for about 2 months now. I love it. The chewable ice nuggets are perfect and are very comparable to what you get at Sonic. I don't currently have it connected to a water line, so I do have to fill it up at least once or twice a day depending on how much ice me and my family consume, but it cranks it out pretty fast. I do plan on figuring out how to connect it to a water line at some point so that I won't need to worry about filling up the reservoir anymore.

The only downside so far is that after a month of making ice, the machine's motor or whatever has become very loud. It has gone from a low humming sound while making ice to a very loud buzzing sound. I'm not sure if that means something is wrong with the unit or what, but I plan to reach out to customer service about it.

Overall if you like to chew ice and love the sonic-style nugget ice, this ice maker does a fantastic job and is a big less expensive than the Opal.",positive

176,Appliances,"COMFEE’ Washing Machine LED Portable Washing Machine and Dryer Washer Lavadora Portátil Compact Laundry, 6 Models, Energy Saving",$219.99 - $379.00,5,"That's what I call it bt, my Ninja Beast. I love it!! I was very skeptical buying a compact mini washer like this. I spent months in searching, reading reviews and specs. I didn't know anyone who had one like this. My neighbor has one that has the dual tub and I didn't understand the concept of those and felt as if those were more work in the long run. I needed a washer, I was tired of having to go to the laundry mats with the virus. I was tired of tip toeing around my other neighbors laundry room late at night (she said I was always welcome to use, not a problem, but I didn't want to inconvenience the other neighbors in case they weren't keen on the idea, a respect thing). But it would eat my quarters and late at night just felt uncomfortable at times, not to mention sleepy. So I eventually gave in to the idea and after months of my research, even months of sitting on this exact model, I caved.

Delivery was on time and prompt. The delivery guys had to bring it up stairs, I felt bad, but I also knew that this wasn't too heavy, roughly 50lbs, 2 men, they got this. They even offered to bring it through my door for me but my balcony was the perfect place for it to be to unbox unwrap and dispose of it all right away. I struggled at first with the maneuverability, but I got a hang of it and although it still isn't that easy to move, it is easy enough (about to buy a portable washer dolly with legs, problem easily solved). The exterior of the machine was a surprise to me. I didn't expect it to be so sleek and sexy like lol. Good job Comfee on the colors and design of the exterior.

Next up was the installation and im not joking here when I say a 2 year old could install it (Although, their strength isn't up to par with making sure those hoses are secured tight lol). I was so gidee to use this that I didn't even hesitate. Read the manual ✔ ran rapid load to clean out and check to see if it works ✔now for the real test, my fiances work clothes. So this is where some will have a problem. The tub is small, yes. But that is to be expected with a mini compact anything, right? I have played around with the combination of his work clothes. He's 6'2 and does sheet rock for a living so you can imagine he's not a tiny guy and his clothes aren't so clean at the end of the day. While I find myself having to do less amount of his clothes, including work pants, I don't mind because I am in the comfort of my own home and right now I have time. So I have found that doing his jeans and socks are a better combination vs mixing all if it because of the balance. Which is another amazing thumbs up to Comfee. If it goes crazy, and which it will if you do not load properly and not over load it, it shuts right off and beeps to warn you ""hey, I need adjusting over here"". Just adjust and press start. However, and this is why it's crucial to load correct capacity and properly because it starts over at the rinse cycle (which living in california is considered wasteful). But I pay attention, and if I hear it start to go off center during the restabilizing process (spin slowly, speed up, slow down, spin faster longer, speed up, slow down. It does this a few times to help stabilize the load in the tub on its own) I will simply press pause and adjust the clothes and press start and I do not have to worry about the water wasting. I have been able to clean queen sized bedding. A quilt, fitted sheets, top sheet and 4 pillow cases without issues. I just would recommend letting the water fill a bit first before putting the blanket in as it will help to bring the bulk of the quilt down, which helped me to not have to stabilize again. I can't wash the bigger fluffier blankets and items but that's okay. It cleans everything just fine and does it quietly. Sometimes I have to check to see if its spinning that's how quiet it is. I can hear my ac unit, which is outside obviously, more from the furthest room in the house vs the washer. Clothes come out pretty dry, damp of course, but not sloppy damp or soaked still. I hang dry, always have, as it preserves the fabrics as well conserves energy. I know, im a total Californian. All in all I love it!!!

This washer is definitely energy efficient. I wanted to see a few bills first before I determined that it was or wasn't energy efficient for me and my living quarters etc etc. I consider myself a decent energy conserver as I was brought up to be mindful of my use as a child as well as, Hey California! So I don't do laundry during peak hours, especially during summer. I use cold water, and I try to pay attention to the weather report and outside temp. If it's going to be a 100 or higher that means my ac is getting full priority that day and is not a laundry day. Honestly, this machine has hardly affected my bill. So keep in mind that being energy efficient doesn't mean you don't have to be mindful of all the other things that use power. It means that with the proper knowledge and steps, it can, will, and is energy efficient.

Would I recommend??? Absolutely!!! 100 times over I'd recommend. It's a ninja, and a beast in one™️. It's Comfee",positive
177,Appliances,"COMFEE’ Washing Machine LED Portable Washing Machine and Dryer Washer Lavadora Portátil Compact Laundry, 6 Models, Energy Saving",$219.99 - $379.00,4,"I waited to write a review until I’ve had this machine for a couple months.
Pro’s:
-Definitely worth buying If you are in an apartment. Size is great and it’s quieter than you think. Easy to move around and set up.
-Washes a decent amount of clothes for one person. Can wash two bath towels and two hand towels and a wash cloth or two pairs of jeans and two polo shirts a couple pairs of underwear. I would not put in more than that.
-It’s spin cycle works particularly well and the clothes come out drier than I’d expected.
-Wash cycles work well too. Clothes do come out clean. And you only have to use a small bit of detergent, which is great.

Overall I am not dissatisfied with this product. However a couple things bug me.

1. After a month of use, I’d say about 5-6 washes a week a strange clanking noise started happening during the wash cycle. For the life of me I can not figure out what it is. It still works fine but every few minutes there is clank that sounds like two pieces of plastic being rubbed together, it does not happen every wash either. It’s been doing this for a month yet the machine has not broken down, which I was expecting. So it’s some kind of glitch I can not figure out.
2. The express wash cycle is a little too express. I’d like 5 more minutes during the washing bit.
3. Not all the water will be expelled from the machine. So if you’re not going to use it for a week of so it will smell a little musty. Not too bad but you definitely should not leave it for more than two weeks. I went on vacation and put the machine at counter level to get the remaining water out before I left. It doesn’t leave a lot there but enough that you wouldn’t want to leave it for an extended period of time without emptying it the way I did. Maybe I’m too worried about this bit, but 🤷‍♂️.
4. The handles to grab the machine in order to move it are at an awkward angle and the wheels only help if you tip the machine at a deep angle. None of this bothers me as I’m strong enough to pick it up, but If you’re not it will make if difficult to move.

Again, not dissatisfied and definitely a whole lot better than sitting in a laundromat when it’s 96 degrees out. If I was to buy this again I would buy the next size larger though. Good luck!🍀",positive

Not a lot of time, not a lot of money. Was hesitant to purchase considering the price, but after realizing how many packs of underwear and socks I've bought last minute because I didn't have time to go to the laundromat, I think this will be cheaper in the long run.

I can fit 2 pairs of scrubs and 2 sweatshirts in one load comfortably. I wouldn't recommend using this for heavily soiled things or bulky things like comforters, quilts, winter coats and such. I will probably continue to use the laundromat for my towels, blankets, and cleaning rags because I like to wash them really hot. But I'm sure I could get a couple sheets in there or a bath towel in a pinch.

Claims to be really cheap- only costing $3 per year in energy if you do 6 loads a week and your water is heated by an electric water heater. I can't comment on that as my utilities are included in my rent, but if I get an angry call from my landlord I'll update this, haha!

TL;DR Not a replacement for a proper washing machine, but, if you have the cash up front, it's perfect for students or anyone who works long, weird hours and has no money for a laundry service.",positive

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to use it. My intention was to use it in the bathroom, but I had no way to adapt it to the faucet in my bathroom, or in my kitchen. Something to keep in mind if you're going to use it in your bathroom, or kitchen: Make sure you have a way to adapt the hose to a faucet or washer hookup. It also needs to be filled through the water inlet (a shower head or bucket can't be used) and the water pressure has to be at a certain rate or it will not sense that there's water in it and it won't agitate.

After meticulously reading washer reviews for 6 months, of all the many options, I chose this one. It is perfect for me. Works great, not too loud, and super easy to use.

You could skip a dryer and air dry your clothes as they do come out pretty dry.. but I got both a dryer and washer and have no regrets as they have worked great washing drying 3-5 times a week so far for 30 days. If your considering it just buy it you won’t regret it.",positive

New washers are so expensive and I've been looking at spin dryers for a while for my tie dye business so I was already somewhat familiar with them in concept.

I bought this machine more as an interim washer until I could buy a new ""regular"" washer. But let me tell you, this not so little machine cleans my clothes better than my old washer! I have a young child and we live on a farm so we're pretty rough on clothes. Stains are a part of life, but not so much anymore! I'm truly amazed at the power of this machine. It's crazy quiet. The buzzer is the loudest part of the machine. The machine is so quiet that when the buzzer goes off it can be a bit of a startle.

I thought having had a large capacity washer for so long it would be hard to ""downsize"" but this is a large capacity in its own right. It's very deep and since it cleans by friction it doesn't have a central agitator and can handle a full size blanket or light queen size throw with no problems.

I haven't been able to remove my old washer, I just hooked this up to the kitchen sink and the quick connect makes it super easy. Just turn on the faucet, hook the drain hose over the lip of the sink and you're ready to go. But you can easily install it to existing hook ups.

I really am surprised at how well this cleans. Don't stuff it full. Just loosely set your clothes in so it has the space to do its job. Even though you will have to do more loads than you would with a large capacity, it uses way less detergent, less water, less energy, cleans better, and spins the clothes nearly dry. Dryer time is cut in half and even line drying, my clothes are soft and fresh and dry quickly. I'm amazed. I love this machine and hope it lasts a while!",positive

I'm over 60 and I'm disabled the box is heavy but I carried it halfway in and then I just set it down on the ground and then I put it on my wheelchair and I pushed it in because though I'm disabled I still can walk just not long ways. So I pushed it up my ramp got in the house rested a while and then opened the Amazon box. Where in I found another box from the maker where that box was on its side even though it was clearly marked up so it was never in the upright position as the manufacturer needs because Amazon just disregarded that fact and so did UPS will UPS didn't know because they only paid attention to what Amazon said but yet they didn't even pay attention to the upmarks when they delivered it to me. So I got it and I read the instructions and it said to let it sit for an hour or more before you use it to let the coolant settle due to shipment and everything which I did. And though I could smell coolant I I washed it and everything and I was surprised. The ice cubes don't taste like coolant and the first batch even if you said it at large the first batch is going to be small. But all the other batches are really nice and you know they're small cubes sure but they last a long time and they're really cold.

I can't speak to lasting as I've had it two days, but in that time, I've filled 3 1 gallon zip lock bags of ice and noise is far from an issue. The most noise it makes is the ice on the plastic as it's dumped into the holding tray. Those claims may have been on defective machines, but mine is not one of those - so far (two days).

As to the softness of the ice. Well, it makes it pretty fast, so the ice I'm sure is barely frozen - EXPECTED! I put the ice in zip lock bags and toss them into the freezer, breaking them up each time I fill them, as they are soft and when frozen ""hard"" they stick together. Dropping the bag on the floor takes care of this ( i have a similar problem with purchased ice) after transporting it from the store to my home.

Easy for her to deactivate the code, open the device, close it and reactivate and scramble the code to keep it secure between uses. Only been about 24 hours since we’ve had the product and so far the one in the kitchen has already broken. Like others have said, it’ll lock you out for no apparent reason. Not sure if my kids somehow found a way to reset the code or something when I wasn’t looking, but after many successful uses, the code I set stopped working and I could no longer access my kitchen refrigerator. I ended up having to cut the device off and take the one from the garage into the kitchen. No worries since my kids are never really out there much anyway and never out there unattended, but the peace of mind of having both refrigerators secure and good feeling of thinking you made a quality purchase are now in question. Still only been about 24 hours so time will tell how long the other one lasts. Hoping at least until my son grows out of this phase.

239,Appliances,Whynter,$181.81 - $686.00,3,"We bought this 1.1 cubic foot, 79-watt freezer to use with a solar power system off-grid by freezing foods (mainly meat) during the day and keeping it frozen without power each night to save on stored power. I tested it for this and found that two pints of water on the bottom floor of this freezer froze and reached 0.3 degrees F after 12 hours, but a pint of water on the wire shelf above only reached 20 degrees after 24 hours. Then with the freezer off for 12 hours, only an ice cube-sized amount of ice was left in the container on the shelf, and the freezer floor ice was about 20% melted. This failed our needs, so I designed a box to nest inside using sheets of ½” foil-backed polyurethane insulation: minimum of two sheets for each wall, four at top and three at back against the compressor compartment. The box is 6.5”x9.5”x13” long, 4”x6.5”x11” inside, holds 6 lbs, and slides in and out with the drip pan. Food freezes coldest (0 to 6 degrees F) with the insulated top off and the box upside down on the drip pan in contact with the actively cooled floor. At night without power, the best orientation of the box is upright with the top on. In this configuration, food inside the box does not thaw overnight. The box cuts about 70 amp-hours of 12v battery drain to our 115v inverter every night, and meat doesn’t spoil between weekly shopping trips.

In normal continuous operation, only the floor area below shelf level of our freezer is suitable for long term food storage. The upper portion is OK for short term frozen goods (fine for ice or soft ice cream), since no contents there go below 19 degrees F with the freezer always on. Another concern with the freezer’s apparent lack of insulation would be power outages longer than a few hours, based on the melting we observed after 12 hours off (ambient home temp was 76 degrees). Otherwise, it seems to be a good little freezer: it’s very quiet, uses little power and doesn’t take up much room.",fair

246,Appliances,Portable Laundry Washing Machine,$257.12 - $685.00,5,"Years ago I found out about portable washers but at the time I had a roommate that disagreed on getting one because of our limited space but fast forward and I have my own place now and I purchased this and am so happy with this purchase! I have never in my life had the privilege of having a washer and/or dryer in my home. At first I was a bit distraught as the included attachment didn't fit on my bathroom faucet (its a weird faucet) I was able to purchase an adapter kit (which still didn't work with my bathroom faucet) but I found out that the right combo of 3 of the adapters put together fits on my shower hose just right and I've been able to do laundry that way, takes a few minutes to set up and I have it drain out into the shower tub which I think is better than the sink cause my tub has a hair/lint catcher already. But I'm fascinated by how this machine cleans my clothes so well. I have had it for a bit over a month now and recently purchased the Panda dryer and although I can't put all my clothes into one load it still saves me the hassle of lugging my stuff to the laundromat and spending $15-$30 every week. I have been able to wash all my clothes, jackets, throw blankets, bed sheets, large towels, small towels, even a thin comforter and even my bath mats! I use less soap and since its just me I no longer have to add laundry sanitizer which I did previously because of the shared machines at the laundromat, so there's more savings there! I also was able to purchase the dolly even though I leave the washer in my bathroom next to the tub (because its a rather large bathroom), its nice to be able to move it around when I need to mop underneath or to move it closer to the shower hose and outlet when in use. I keep up with the maintenance of the machine cause I want it to last for a long time so after every use I wipe it down make sure inside of the lid edge is all clean, I unscrew the little filter in the back and drain it and make sure its clean and I clean the inside of the drum lint filter as well as it gets FULL of lint and cat fur. Something else I found really helpful was because the machine is on the dolly it makes it way taller than my sink and tub so I had noticed at first that when I had the drainage tube set up over the tub and draining into the tub it would drain while also filling up and I thought that I got a doozy BUT in order for the drum to fill up you just have to make sure the drainage tube it set where its either higher than the machine or at the same level and not way down below the drum. Once I set it up in the tub that it was higher all was good and the drum was able to fill up properly.
I did a lot of research before purchasing the machine like water usage, and that it barely uses any electricity and I watched a ton of YouTube video reviews of the same machine to see how they set it up and worked with it and made me more confident in the purchase since it was a bit of a bigger purchase for me. I did the same with the panda dryer and I've been happy with both. If it means not being at a dirty, loud and gross laundromat and I can do laundry in my home no matter how long it takes, I am happy.
I would 100% recommend this machine, it arrived within 2 days, set up was easy, doesn't take much water and uses a minimal amount of electricity and does like a normal washing machine would do just smaller.",positive
247,Appliances,Portable Laundry Washing Machine,$257.12 - $685.00,5,"I bought this for a cabin that doesnt have laundry room and laundry hookups. This works as well as all the other positive reviews claim. It is easily rolled on the two wheels that are built in. However I purchased a light weight set of locking casters and now have four (4) wheels that make moving much easier. You will need locking casters if you do this. The machine will move if you put it on wheels that don't lock.

I have had success with washing just about everything. Large plush bath towels - three (3) at a time. XXL t-shirts six (6) or eight (8) at a time. 34 inch inseam blue jeans - two pairs at a time. The manufacturter discourages using hot water. I have used nothing but cold water and have been satisfied. I am only washing adult clothes and the dirtiest of them are shirts and shorts I wear doing yard work. No problem for this or other clothes. If you have dirty kids clothes they may need to be washed in smaller batches. Cannot say for certain, I just recall those times and dealing with dirty uniforms and muddy soccer socks.

The machine is relatively quiet when in washing cycles. It does get a little louder when in spin cycles. This isn't much worse than a cheap dish washer.

I'm pleased with the washer and the companion Black and Decker dryer. They solve my problem and are a welcome convenience over hauling laundry to and fro.",positive
248,Appliances,Portable Laundry Washing Machine,$257.12 - $685.00,4,"Overall I give this 4 stars. It cleans beautifully and I love the control I have over washing clothes. I had to leave mid wash and was able to pause the clothes before they were rinsed then do a rinse cycle once I got back. However, there are a few things to note that may not be quite clear in the instructions :

1. the bottom cover was a bit tricky, however be sure to line up the hole on the panel with the screw hole on the machine. That's how I figured out which way was correct.
2. DO NOT open the lid with the machine running. It will give you an E2 code. If this happens, close the lid and press the start/pause button. That usually fixes it
3. if you are washing pillows, it may have a hard time reading water levels. I have washed 4 decorative pillows so far and the larger ones took a bit longer due to this issue
4. If you are connecting this to a faucet, MONITOR THE WATER HOSE. It doesn't have a way to turn off the water coming from a faucet. I turn the faucet on and off manually when it is filling up. Leaving the faucet on and unattended WILL CAUSE WATER TO SPRAY EVERYWHERE!
5. the hose attachment and adapter provided are rather large so you may need an adapter. I bought one for $10 from ACE Hardware.
6. this cleans well but it is not a full sized washer. There is no agitator in the middle and it does not aggressively wash clothes. Be sure to use quality soap and do not overload the washer. Make sure the clothes are completely submerged under the water level by a few inches.

I took off one star because I feel the instructions were a bit lacking. I was able to figure it all out but I understand how it may be confusing for others. Overall I am soooo happy to have this little machine. Hopefully it has some longevity. It has been very quiet to the point I forgot it was on. Also, it does an excellent job of spinning the clothe dry. I do not have an in home dryer but it spins them so well that they dry in a few hours any way while hanging up.",positive
249,Appliances,Portable Laundry Washing Machine,$257.12 - $685.00,5,"For the last year and a half I've had one of the small portable washer that have the tub on the left and a small spin bin on the right. While it was great for small loads, it was not good for doing larger items like blankets or a bed comforter. I was looking for 3 cu. ft. portable washers for a long time and most of them have the same layout (controls).

SIZE CAPACITY: When I saw the Black+Decker 26.5 lb washer, I wasn't sure how that translated into cubic feet so I went to the B+D website and it is listed as a 3.0 cu ft washer for the BPWM30W model.

SOUND LEVEL: I've done large, medium, and small loads. The washer is definitely quieter when doing a small load and the shaking while spinning is not significant. When doing medium or large loads, the noise level is louder when spinning, but nothing that exceeds what I would hear with a regular sized washing machine.

HOSES & QUICK CONNECT: The machine comes with 4 foot rubber hoses so while waiting for this to be delivered, I purchased some stainless steel hoses with an elbow. My thinking was that the stainless steel hose would be better to withstand the pressure of the water while it was in ""off"" mode (the faucet stays turned on, but the water is automatically stopped from going into the machine when it's done filling). DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE I MADE.

While the stainless steel hoses are fine, the end with the threads doesn't work properly with the quick connect that comes the washer. The quick connect part to which you tighten the hose is not round, it's hexagon shaped. So there was a noticeable leak where the stainless steel hose and quick connect met. That leak then travel along the hose down onto my floor.

Since I changed to using the washer at my kitchen sink, I also used the original 4ft. hoses that came with the machine and it works perfectly with the odd hexagon shaped end of the quick connect -- absolutely not leaks.

MOBILITY: I've read many reviews for 2.0 and 3.0 cu. ft portable washers, and something they have in comment is that the wheel that come on them are ridiculous small. Not only that, you have to tip the machine in order to use the two wheel.

Rather than dealing with that silliness, I bought a washer dolly with 4 locking wheel and set the machine on top of that. The feet of the washer feet perfectly on the corners of the roller without having to expand the size of the dolly. An advantage of placing the washer on a dolly is the ground clearance. When it comes tie to clean the drain pump on the bottom of the back, there is enough room to place a bowl to catch the water. If the you leave the machine directly on the floor, then the water that comes out of the drain pump will be leak onto the floor unless you place a towel there.

OVERALL: I'm very happy with this washer it's capacity. It may be portable, but it can handle washing a queen-sized blanket and/or comforter (NOT feathered though -- I only take those to the dry cleaner).",positive
250,Appliances,Portable Laundry Washing Machine,$257.12 - $685.00,4,"I’ve already done 3 washes, and it works really well. It also spins dry (the same as a regular sized washer). You def have to do a lot of research. If you’ve done your research then you will have no issues. I def recommend watching some youtube videos if you are unsure of the installation. (1) Be sure you check that your gaskets are all there when connecting to the water. You should use sealant tape if still experiencing leaks, but I haven’t experienced any from the hose. 2) You may want to buy another hose to connect to the water and a sink adapter. I’m seeing that long term use with the provided hose might be problematic for some people (just the one connecting to the water). I just bought a separate hose. (3) Keep double-checking for leaks to be sure everything is functioning properly, especially while it is running. (4) I’m not finding many people on youtube or other sources talk about the experience of moving the washer to another location in your home after you’re done using it. I think most people have it in a permanent spot, but I know lots of people may be using it in the bathroom and will have to move it to another location when finished. This involves disconnecting the hose and everything. To be sure there are no leaks, I strongly recommend buying a tray that fits under to catch any water and be sure to carefully empty both hoses that work with the washer. I didn’t experience any leaks until I tried to move the washers location forgetting there’s highly likely some water left inside. It was leaking from the bottom after removing the hose due to me tilting the machine from moving it, so I def should’ve emptied it properly. With it being heavy, you could get a small dolly to help with moving, but I highly recommend getting a tray for the bottom of it. Overall, it was a good purchase. I def wish it came with its own tray",positive

I need a washer like this, so I shopped Amazon for 2 months until I settled on this one.
1st. It's branded Black and Decker. I know Black and Decker didn't manufacture it, but I believed that Black and Decker wouldn't just slap their name on a toy.
2nd. I waited until I could save a few dollars.

I love this machine. It works fast and gets clothing clean. I can move it to a corner when I don't need it.

253,Appliances,Portable Laundry Washing Machine,$257.12 - $685.00,5,"I researched a lot before buying this washer last year. I think I watched every YouTube video and read every review out there for this and a dozen other washers before finally selecting this one. It has been 1 full year, and this probably remains the number one most important and non-regretful purchase I’ve ever made, in my whole life!

It’s held up extremely well for a year of almost weekly use, I have no technical problems to report. I find it quieter than my dishwasher, and it really does get my clothes fully clean (and very dry, where they only need to hang for a couple of hours to finish drying). I wash all my clothes, towels, and even Queen-sized sheets and blankets. If I’m doing bedding I have to do several loads (like one sheet and a pillowcase at a time), but it’s still so much easier and less time consuming than trying to use my shared building laundry. Plus, no more quarters, no more stinky shared machines, no more people stealing my machines! I also find I use less detergent overall since this machine is so efficient, even if I’m doing more overall loads.

I also find my clothes are holding up much nicer, because I’m hang-drying everything and washing in cold water. I like that it has the gentle cycle for especially delicate things.

Some user tips:
I personally would recommend liquid detergent over pods. Pods are portioned for full loads, so it’s a little wasteful to pay for a full load of detergent when it’s really only half a load at a time. With liquid detergent you can choose exactly how much to use at a time, and know that you don’t need as much as if you were running a big full machine.

It is a little cumbersome to move—it only has two wheels on one side, so you have to tip it far in one direction to roll. In the beginning I rolled it back and forth to the sink every time between washes, but now I just leave it permanently next to the sink since I use it almost every week. If I need to move it over a couple feet I just lift it to move—I have a really bad back, but I’m able to lift it a couple inches to move a short distance no problem.

I also recommend always double-checking that the tubes are fully secure on both the faucet and where they connect to the washer! I’ve made the mistake of not fully securing them and then flooding my floor… mostly my error. I do have to tape down the drainage tube to the sink (see picture) or it can fall off. When it’s done washing, I remove the drainage tube and pump out remaining water into a bowl on the floor so it doesn’t get musty. A little bit of work, but takes no more than 1 minute.

Again, just tips for using, not at all deterrants to buying! I truly recommend this product so much, to anyone in any living situation. My neighbors even ask to come over all the time and use my machine instead of the building machines—it really is amazing AND worth it!",positive

I have no regrets buying this (partnered with B&D compact dryer). It came with hot & cold water lines, easy for me to connect myself. I use HE laundry pods, since HE detergent is required. I thought I might not like doing small loads but surprise, I no longer wait for enough clothes for an extra large load. This means less dirty clothes waiting for laundry day. I may never use a full size again! The big bonus is super clean laundry AND the items I hang to dry air dry so fast. That is how excellent the spin cycle is! This is my unsolicited glowing report. TIP: buying this B&D compact set was more economical than an all in one washer/dryer. 👍👍",positive

We have 6 people in the household and we all like ice water to drink all day. I’m making right about 10 -15 lbs of ice each day to refill our ice bin in the freezer since we go through it so fast.

MY TIPS:

I recommend before dumping a full basket of ice into your freezer that you tap the “ice machine dispensing bucket” on a clean towel just to get the excess water off the cubes “before” dumping ice cubes into your refrigerator’s freezer bin our the ice cubes tend to stick together. I use a wooden spoon to break up the ice in the freezer bin, each time, I dump the machine’s bucket into my freezer. It will just help to prevent the cubes from sticking together. These cubes do have just enough moisture in them to make them stick together after dumping them into “a more frozen” ice bin. So that’s the main drawback but easily solved by briefly breaking the cubes apart with a wooden spoon each dumping. After that routine, the cubes are ready to serve and scoop up more loosely.

We have a really good water purification system so the cubes from this machine are crystal clear with no tap water taste so taste will be based on the water you’re pouring into this machine. The machine does not determine the taste, it’s all about the water you’re using bottom line.

The noise level, is a low hum, and there is warm air that the machine blows into the room it’s in. If you don’t want it, to add warm air into the room, put the machine outside on a shaded patio.

Lastly, drain and dry the inside of the ice maker when done and leave the top door open the so it can, completely dry out, or…mildew can develop…if you are trapping any moisture in it while not in use.

Following these usage needs tips will help you to I love this machine! 20-25 lbs in 24 hours is accurate estimate. I make ice and store it in advance of a gathering.",positive

No, it does not keep the ice cool, but we turn it on and anytime someone comes into the kitchen, they dump the bucket into a large ziploc gallon bag and put it in the freezer. So at all times we have about 3 gallon bags of ice ready to go. You just slam it on the counter a few times and empty into freezer bucket and bam. Ice for several days. Rinse and repeat.

306,Appliances,Clear 2 Ice Makers,$19.95 - $86.95,5,"These took me a little while to figure out the right method, but once I did they’ve worked great. I read a few reviews that said if you leave it in the freezer too long the ice balls will be cloudy, however that hasn’t been my experience. I left these in my freezer while on vacation for 3 weeks, when I came home and pulled out the molds they ice balls will still crystal clear.

The only knock I have on these is that it takes a long time to make the ice balls. The manufacturer says 24-36 hours, my experience is that it’s closer to 36 or even 48 hours. Now I do have a huge freezer chest in my garage where I put these, so that might be part of the issue.

Is also wish the ice balls were just a little bigger, but all and all these things are freaking awesome.",positive
307,Appliances,Clear 2 Ice Makers,$19.95 - $86.95,5,"The invention of the automatic ice maker is a godsend in my book. Though it gets boring when you have the same old ice maker machine ice for when you want an ice-cold drink in a nice glass.

And then, in steps the Berlinzo Clear Ice Ball Maker Mold, and you have fancy-dancy ice balls for your fancy drinks.

While it is not automatic, you have to fill this mold and its holder with water, then place it in the freezer for up to 24 hours, indeed it works. My first Ice Ball was terrific, now my second one was not so great, but that was my fault, as I did not dump the ice that formed in the base of the holder out and start fresh with all water. Not sure why, but I see in other comments on the page that it needs to breathe.

It was an easy process, to clean the mold and holder when I took it out of the box, filled the holder with water, inserted the mold into the holder, and placed it in my freezer. Just make sure you have room in your freezer for the holder, it is a tad bulky. The next day I took it out, opened it up and there was a perfect ice ball. I have read some comments that the ice did not come out clear, for me it did, using only Washington DC City tap water. I wonder if I use fancy bottled water if the ice will be even better.
The only downside I see is it makes one ice ball at a time, and it takes 24 hours. Fine if you want to drink alone or are thinking far enough ahead that you take several days to make several ice balls for drinks with friends. Though I see on their site they have a two-ice ball mold set up as well. For now, I will continue to make one ice ball a day and put the ice ball in my freezer ice storage bucket. I took several out that I made day after day, and they were all just fine.

I am pleased with the ease of use, the quality of materials, and the finished product that the mold makes. I like its well-designed packaging, and the shipping on Amazon was quick and no hassle. This is a great housewarming gift, or general gift, for a friend who likes to make nice drinks. You don’t have to drink alcohol to have a nice-looking drink with ice in it, it will be great for an Arnold Palmer-style drink. I think kids will get a kick out of these ice balls in their drinks too, it will make them feel so grown up. I am looking forward to making a bunch of ice balls and having them stacked up in a glass ice container for a future event.

I think you will enjoy this product as much as I have, and am going to this fancy-dancy drink season!",positive
308,Appliances,Clear 2 Ice Makers,$19.95 - $86.95,4,"GOOD NEWS: This ice cube maker does exactly what it says it will do: makes beautiful, crystal clear ice balls for your cocktails… or whatever beverage you want to ‘dress up’!

It’s very easy and non-complicated to use following the simple steps. I have made three or four batches of ice balls at this point and they’re awesome! I have been extremely impressed at how cold they keep my drink and how slow they melt even when I am poolside in 105° heat. Highly recommend! They take my drink to a new level…. I feel so sophisticated, lol!

BAD NEWS: if you live alone, there is no hope you will be able to remove the silicone molds after you have frozen the ice balls in the freezer. Literally: NO chance. As I said, I’ve made several batches, and every time I’ve tried to pop the ice balls out, it takes both me and my husband to remove the silicone mold. Like, I’m holding the bottom and my husband is pulling the silicone handles with all his might using both hands (and he’s plenty strong lol!) So, if you live alone, hopefully you have a nice strong neighbor (not a 90 lb weakling) who can help you remove the mold or you’ll never get the ice balls out. Of course, you will now have to use up one of your 2 ice balls and some of your liquor to probably reward said neighbor…. so this could prove costly. It’s literally IMPOSSIBLE for one person to remove the ice balls. I have experimented with different things like running a little tapwater over the icemaker to try to loosen up the mold but nothing has worked so far.

Oh, how I've missed having a dishwasher! This one is absolutely perfect for me!

I measured carefully, compared 10 different machines, and chose this model mainly bc I can pour the water into the top.

It comes with a hose and adapters to connect to the faucet or to the water line under the sink, but I wanted options and alot of other models are just one or the other.

It comes with a water pitcher and funnel type thing. It beeps when youve out in enough water (about 4 pitchers). Works great 👍

I use liquid Cascade bc I read reviews that the pods didn't dissolve completely. Haven't had any problems with liquid and my dishes come clean!

Being able to see what's going on when the washer is running is important bc it's so small. I can see right away if a dish is blocking the water and can rearrange before the whole cycle runs.

I moved my utensil tray to the bottom, and I just lay all my silverware flat instead of hanging thru the slots. It gives me more room bc I put bowls and cups on top of them.

The water spray is stronger from the bottom sprayer, so everything still gets super clean.

It fits perfectly on the little piece of countertop next to my sink, and the drain hose is sectioned down into the drain on that side of the sink. It is easy to move the drain hose out of the way if needed, but I just leave it.

My first note is not about the product, but about delivery times. My package sat in the warehouse for three days after placing my order and arrived 2 days late.

However, it did arrive in great shape. The box was constructed from thick and sturdy cardboard, which was well sealed and strapped. The product was secure inside a nest of dense styrofoam.

Upon removing the washer from its box, I was immediately impressed with the build quality. Images I saw this thing online made it look like a toy. But in person, it’s plainly evident that this is a serious appliance.

Setup was a breeze. After removing a few bits of foam used to stabilize the rack during shipping, it was only a matter of attaching a hose and plugging it in

Measure your space carefully. I was initially going to purchase a more well-known brand, but it was just a tiny bit too big.

This unit was the perfect fit.

I'm not planning on plumbing this dishwasher, so I have to note that the supplied pitcher is much smaller than the reservoir tank, so it took 4 of them to fill the unit. Use the supplied plastic fill funnel - it lets you empty a whole pitcher at once, which is MUCH faster than carefully pouring water from the pitcher to the fill hole!

There is one design flaw for anyone placing this under a counter like me. The dishwasher will need to be pulled forward to access the fill-hole, but the unit’s rubber feet make that very difficult. I replaced them with a set of glides, making the task pretty effortless.

I found the unit to be deceptively spacious inside. I just happened to have a mess of dishes in my sink when this was delivered, unrinsed and at least a day old. The whole lot of them fit in the washer easily, with room to spare.

The dishwasher springs to life with the push of a button. I think the “Normal” cycle runs a bit long, at 2 hours and 10 minutes. There are quicker settings, so I’ll try those next time.

The clear door is a nice feature, and seeing it work made me more confident in the washer’s performance. This thing runs like a champ, just like a full-size dishwasher. Only smaller.

Once the cycle was complete the dishes were spotless.

It’s:

Works incredibly well for a table top dishwasher.

Out of the box - I didn’t read the instructions so a bit of a flood occurred, completely user error, 🤣 but if you do follow the instructions, it is a super simple set up. Basically attach the drain hose, turn on, fill with water until you hear a beep. Pick your cycle, add detergent and you’re off. I normally use this where there are only 2 people and it fits our normal amount of plates, bowls, and utensils just perfect. We have also used it just for our wine/drink glasses on a separate cycle and it did a phenomenal job.

We have it set up right under our cabinet - so we don’t have to move it to fill we just leave the funnel on the top all the time and it works great. There is a food trap that we have cleaned.

I have a small 100 year old house with a tiny kitchen that we just renovated with new cabinets, sink, oven, range hood and microwave... I hung the microwave on the wall in an under cabinet mount, so that allowed me to have the space for this... We looked at the possibility of a full sized or even an apartment sized dishwasher, but we just could not configured our cabinets to accommodate the space. This ended up being the best option, and the price was right. There is 2 adults and one child in our household, so this machine will fit our daily dishes at night with no problem.

I was concerned about it fitting under our cabinets, so i rolled the dice and got it to see if it would.. As you can see in the picture, it is just a fraction over 17 inches tall... Our cabinets are 18 1/4 from the counter top, so the machine has about 3/4 inch to spare. It is kind of awkward to slide in and out of the corner with the rubber feet on the bottom (especially with 5 liters of water in it), and an appliance slider would be just too tall, we bought an over sized gaming mouse pad and flipped it over underneath the machine. The smooth side of the mouse pad makes the dishwasher side effortlessly on our quartz counter tops, and the underside rubber part of the pad meets the rubber feet of the machine making sure it doesn't slip off the pad.

I ran the machine twice on the first night i got it, once empty to test for leaks and noise level, and then after that successful test, a full load of lightly rinsed dishes. It met my expectations 100%. No leaks, no louder than a full sized machine, and the dishes came out spotless!

I will update this review in the future if there are any issue with leaking, the sprayers, the water pump, or anything else... But so far, i think this is an excellent machine that does exactly what its supposed to do!",positive

It generally gets most things clean in that time, I definitely wipe off and rinse anything before putting it in, trying to start with the best possible for the washer. However, at the end, there is still a bit of soapiness. The dishes require another rinse in the sink after the dishwasher completes the Rapid setting.
I would imagine the Normal 210 minute wash does not have this problem, but I can't afford nearly two gallons of gas to wash dishes.

Our refrigerator ice maker broke and it was going to cost a fortune to fix, so this was a suitable answer!
The only negative I can see is that it doesn't actually have a freezer function to keep the ice frozen once the bin is full...BUT I don't really think that's super important because if some of the ice melts, the water goes back into the reservoir and more ice is made.
We need a lot of ice for coolers (living in a beach community) so we just try to empty it into bags whenever the bin is full...and save the bags of ice in the freezer. (It even came with bags!...see photo) Works great for our needs!",positive

This is model EFRF694 and I tried numerous times to register it on Frigidaire’s website, but they don’t recognize the model when trying to enter it. So, put the burden on the extended warranty company should a problem arise.

Delivery seemed OK, but upon unboxing it, the top rear black vented bracket was damaged. Assessing the damage and that the purpose of the plastic bracket is to keep from placing the freezer to close to the back wall, I decided not to return it IF the freezer operated as expected.

Before plugging it it, I let it sit upright for a few hours so in case it had been on its side prior to receiving it, the refrigerant would return to its correct orientation.

Level in its intended space, I plugged it in with a freezer thermometer inside and checked the temp after 25 minutes... 10 degrees. After 1 hour, 0 degrees. Later I loaded the freezer with meats & other frozen items (nice inside space - much easier to organize than a chest type freezer where it’s hard to see/find). After around 9-10 hours, the inside temperature is minus 5 degrees.

Aside from the rear damage I mentioned, I have now noticed a very small ding in the front door. Both the rear damage and front door ding obviously occurred during shipping... One very obvious and the other not do much. The shipping box is cardboard and certainly not thick enough. There was styrofoam protection on each corner, but thin and obviously designed to steady the freezer in shipment as were top & bottom styrofoam pieces. Not good enough to protect the freezer during normal handling and certainly not good enough if shipping gets a little rough.

So 2 Things To Remember:
1 - Get the extended warranty - No apparent way to register it with Frigidaire***
2 - There may be some shipping damage & you’ll need to decide If you want to keep the freezer or return it. If it works well and you can live with the appearance, keep it as the replacement may be much worse.

***From what I can determine reading the included manual, I believe this freezer was manufactured in Canada",fair

I love this freezer. I did a lot of research before purchasing and I want to thank all those who posted about their experience with this particular freezer. Those reviews help me to decide to give this one a try and I am so glad I did. It really does hold a lot of food and helps me with not over loading my main Freezer. I needed that extra to hold my meats mostly so I did not have to stop purchasing foods I wanted to purchase because I did not have anymore freezer space and this purchase really helped me out with that issue. I listen to the suggestions and warnings about what to do and not do and it made my process so much easier when I started to question certain thinks like why is the side warm and how long to let it sit before putting my food in it and all of that helped me so much. I let my freezer sit for 1 1/2 day just to be sure and then I put some water in it to test it out for freezing and it was a beautiful thing! Love, love love it. If you are on the fence as I was, get off and purchase it as it is a real good deal from Amazon.

416,Appliances,Broan-NuTone Under-Cabinet Convertible Range Hood,$62.31 - $276.20,5,"The one thing to get out of the way first: this is a direct replacement for the standard hood found nearly everywhere. With that being said, the caveat is that mine had the cabinet hole for the wires on the other side, so some minor drilling was needed. Meh.
All in all though, with the last one rattling and the light so yellowed it might have bested a single match, this is a cheap and pretty easy upgrade. We left the old screws, mostly because they are part of the cabinetry now, and one corner argued about fitting a bit but I made it understand. Had to splice a little extra wire because apparently the wiring has switched sides since 1961, but minimal understanding of electrical workings is all it took. Gotta learn when you live in a house that ineptitude built 60 years ago!
Fan is of course a bit noisy but nothing like the emphysema afflicted dragon I had before, and the light… lights up the range! It’s not space age, but I’m a simple kinda girl so it does me just fine.

430,Appliances,VIVOHOME Electric Portable Compact Countertop Automatic Ice Cube Maker Machine with Hand Scoop and Self Cleaning Function 26lbs/day,$149.99 - $169.99,4,"My wife is obsessed with what she calls ""poop ice"".

I thought this would work, but even the small ""bullets"" are about twice the size of her ""poop ice"".

Aside from that, it's a pretty neat device. It creates ice very quickly, drops it in the basket, and lets it slowly melt to be recycled again. So if it's full of water, this will just go forever (which may or may not be good). My wife hates it running nonstop, so we just use it when we have guests.

 I wanted to use the ice maker a few times before reviewing it, because a 5 star review with ""looks nice, haven't used it yet"" is pretty worthless. Received it mid-April 2022. Waited 2 days to let coolant settle as recommended, wiped out the inside. I chose this ice maker because you can invert a water bottle on top and not have to keep filling the reservoir. I used 1-gal bottle of distilled water. Like putting a bottle on the water cooler, it takes a knack to flip the bottle and set it on the nipple w/o spilling half the water. I used a step-stool so I was see what I was aiming for on top of the machine. The ice maker calls itself ""countertop"" model so it fits on the counter, but its the size of 4 toasters stacked 2 on 2, so its not going to live on my countertop.
So, plugged in, first gallon set on top, (the water reservoir holds a little less than 1-gallon so there's still water in the inverted bottle. It siphons nicely), pushed buttons per instructions and she started right up. Instructions are pretty clear, the ice maker is not overly loud (well, for my house anyway) after cooling itself a minute or 2, the screen shows the number of minutes to make ice. Each cycle of ice ""sheet"" took 5 minutes, but I didn't time the entire gallon of water, and I didn't weigh the total ice produced. I didn't want to babysit the process, so I just did other stuff until I heard the ice drop into the bin, then transferred it to zip-bags into freezer. The included ""scoop"" is useless and now resides in my cat's kibble. I did see a few comments about the ice melting in the bin. It MAKES ice. It's NOT a freezer. So, yes, you have to transfer the ice to your freezer within a few minutes. I didn't pay attention to ""start to finish"" time but noticed it sat idling for a few minutes before checking the reservoir was empty of water. I had 4 'full' gallon-size zip bags plus one ""sheet"" of ice. So, I used 2 gallons of water, in 2 days of ice making, that time.
A few weeks later, early May, I brought out the machine and made ice from another 2 gallons of distilled water. It worked like a champ again! It was quiet to run, I didn't babysit the process.
4 gallon bags of ice does not keep my family going for a month. Yes, we purchased ice between time. I'm stingy and kept my ice for me.
So... now it's end of June, I have my 2 gal of distilled water and nothing going on on my countertop for a few hours, might as well make ice! I set it up, it ran smoothly, I heard the first batch of ice drop into the bin, I put it in my bag then into freezer. Ice maker starts its new cycle, a minute or 3 later.... - OK, NOW WATCH MY VIDEO - standing next to the machine, the screeching startled me enough to drop my glass of ice water! I pushed the button to pause the machine! Eyebrows up in my hairline, I decided to ""look under the hood"", like a motorist on the side of the road with no clue what to look for. Still full of water. I pressed the button again and it started its cycle, me with my phone ready to catch sight of the screaming demon that has possessed my ice maker! Yup, it screamed, I paused it again.
Now... my dilemma - do I let it run? Sacrifice my machine to save a buck-50's worth of water?? (Like spending $40 more to save $5 shipping) So... I decided if it's still running it can't be too bad, if the motor is burning out - might as well see if I can get a little more ice out of it.
I had my fire extinguisher handy, moved the machine as far from the elec outlet as the cord allows, so I can unplug it, and I let it run.
When the machine is paused, it shows the temperature of the water (?) which was normally 75°F to 80°F. The temp showed 92°F! But I went ahead and let it screech. Normally the cycle time is 5-6 minutes for ice. It showed 18 minutes now. 12 minutes into the scream cycle the screaming stopped, the machine continued running and continued its countdown. It finished its cycle at normal motor decibel. Then it started the cycle again, a few minutes in, it starts screeching again. Pausing showed 88°F but I let it continue and again the noise stopped after about 10 mins. I unplugged it after the ice cycle completed. As I was yelling at the machine to ""SIT THERE AND THINK ABOUT YOUR BEHAVIOR!!"" my husband gave me the eye roll, moved the machine around, set a little fan blowing on the machine's exhaust intake screen, told me to stop torturing my toys, and think about my own behavior. Oh, and would I make him a sandwich, please?
I turned the machine back on later in the afternoon, it screeched only a few minutes during each cycle but made ice. This morning it's running quietly and finishing a gallon of water.
It was hot yesterday - 100° outside. It was warm inside - probably about 80° - we don't have a/c in our old farmhouse. I'll use it when the weather is cooler or until it dies a loud painful death when the weather is hot and I want ice!
So, as far as recommending this ice maker, it depends on what you can tolerate.
No extended warranty is offered, but it would be nice if it did.",fair
437,Appliances,"Silonn Countertop Ice Cube Ice Makers, Auto Self-Cleaning,",$116.00 - $199.99,5,"I moved to another state, and am renting a house. The fridge does NOT make ice- we now have a '94 White that runs like a top, but it's definitely NOT fancy. Because I knew this would probably be the case, when we decided to move, I bought the icemaker, because I love icewater, and don't love buying bags of stuff, or dedicating a big space for ice cube trays.
This machine was my solution. Absolutely NO regrets.

It is:
Easy to clean.
Easy to maintain.
Easy to use.
Really fast.
And FAR better quality than I expected, for the price.

Only downsides are, you do have to move that ice to the freezer yourself, and it does take up some countertop real estate...and you do have to add the water manually, either using the adapter for big bottles, or pouring it in. But these are pretty minor things, given the up-sides. And, the manual addition of water means that I can use filtered water from the pitcher that I had to buy, because, again, 1994 refrigerator. (I do miss that in-door water filter!)

Bottom line, I would absolutely buy this again. Hopefully, I won't have to, anytime soon! So far, this thing has knocked it outta the park all summer, keeping us supplied with ice even when the fridge broke down (landlord found a dude who still had some old R12 in his shop to FIX the thing, so the Refriga-Beast remains!

also, it will accommodate a gallon jug of water on top. It shuts off when full or out of water. I would recommend using filtered water - just a personal preference.

 I wanted to use the ice maker a few times before reviewing it, because a 5 star review with ""looks nice, haven't used it yet"" is pretty worthless. Received it mid-April 2022. Waited 2 days to let coolant settle as recommended, wiped out the inside. I chose this ice maker because you can invert a water bottle on top and not have to keep filling the reservoir. I used 1-gal bottle of distilled water. Like putting a bottle on the water cooler, it takes a knack to flip the bottle and set it on the nipple w/o spilling half the water. I used a step-stool so I was see what I was aiming for on top of the machine. The ice maker calls itself ""countertop"" model so it fits on the counter, but its the size of 4 toasters stacked 2 on 2, so its not going to live on my countertop.
So, plugged in, first gallon set on top, (the water reservoir holds a little less than 1-gallon so there's still water in the inverted bottle. It siphons nicely), pushed buttons per instructions and she started right up. Instructions are pretty clear, the ice maker is not overly loud (well, for my house anyway) after cooling itself a minute or 2, the screen shows the number of minutes to make ice. Each cycle of ice ""sheet"" took 5 minutes, but I didn't time the entire gallon of water, and I didn't weigh the total ice produced. I didn't want to babysit the process, so I just did other stuff until I heard the ice drop into the bin, then transferred it to zip-bags into freezer. The included ""scoop"" is useless and now resides in my cat's kibble. I did see a few comments about the ice melting in the bin. It MAKES ice. It's NOT a freezer. So, yes, you have to transfer the ice to your freezer within a few minutes. I didn't pay attention to ""start to finish"" time but noticed it sat idling for a few minutes before checking the reservoir was empty of water. I had 4 'full' gallon-size zip bags plus one ""sheet"" of ice. So, I used 2 gallons of water, in 2 days of ice making, that time.
A few weeks later, early May, I brought out the machine and made ice from another 2 gallons of distilled water. It worked like a champ again! It was quiet to run, I didn't babysit the process.
4 gallon bags of ice does not keep my family going for a month. Yes, we purchased ice between time. I'm stingy and kept my ice for me.
So... now it's end of June, I have my 2 gal of distilled water and nothing going on on my countertop for a few hours, might as well make ice! I set it up, it ran smoothly, I heard the first batch of ice drop into the bin, I put it in my bag then into freezer. Ice maker starts its new cycle, a minute or 3 later.... - OK, NOW WATCH MY VIDEO - standing next to the machine, the screeching startled me enough to drop my glass of ice water! I pushed the button to pause the machine! Eyebrows up in my hairline, I decided to ""look under the hood"", like a motorist on the side of the road with no clue what to look for. Still full of water. I pressed the button again and it started its cycle, me with my phone ready to catch sight of the screaming demon that has possessed my ice maker! Yup, it screamed, I paused it again.
Now... my dilemma - do I let it run? Sacrifice my machine to save a buck-50's worth of water?? (Like spending $40 more to save $5 shipping) So... I decided if it's still running it can't be too bad, if the motor is burning out - might as well see if I can get a little more ice out of it.
I had my fire extinguisher handy, moved the machine as far from the elec outlet as the cord allows, so I can unplug it, and I let it run.
When the machine is paused, it shows the temperature of the water (?) which was normally 75°F to 80°F. The temp showed 92°F! But I went ahead and let it screech. Normally the cycle time is 5-6 minutes for ice. It showed 18 minutes now. 12 minutes into the scream cycle the screaming stopped, the machine continued running and continued its countdown. It finished its cycle at normal motor decibel. Then it started the cycle again, a few minutes in, it starts screeching again. Pausing showed 88°F but I let it continue and again the noise stopped after about 10 mins. I unplugged it after the ice cycle completed. As I was yelling at the machine to ""SIT THERE AND THINK ABOUT YOUR BEHAVIOR!!"" my husband gave me the eye roll, moved the machine around, set a little fan blowing on the machine's exhaust intake screen, told me to stop torturing my toys, and think about my own behavior. Oh, and would I make him a sandwich, please?
I turned the machine back on later in the afternoon, it screeched only a few minutes during each cycle but made ice. This morning it's running quietly and finishing a gallon of water.
It was hot yesterday - 100° outside. It was warm inside - probably about 80° - we don't have a/c in our old farmhouse. I'll use it when the weather is cooler or until it dies a loud painful death when the weather is hot and I want ice!
So, as far as recommending this ice maker, it depends on what you can tolerate.

The fridge does NOT make ice- we now have a '94 White that runs like a top, but it's definitely NOT fancy. Because I knew this would probably be the case, when we decided to move, I bought the icemaker, because I love icewater, and don't love buying bags of stuff, or dedicating a big space for ice cube trays.
This machine was my solution. Absolutely NO regrets.

It is:
Easy to clean.
Easy to maintain.
Easy to use.
Really fast.
And FAR better quality than I expected, for the price.

Only downsides are, you do have to move that ice to the freezer yourself, and it does take up some countertop real estate...and you do have to add the water manually, either using the adapter for big bottles, or pouring it in. But these are pretty minor things, given the up-sides. And, the manual addition of water means that I can use filtered water from the pitcher that I had to buy, because, again, 1994 refrigerator. (I do miss that in-door water filter!)

Bottom line, I would absolutely buy this again. Hopefully, I won't have to, anytime soon! So far, this thing has knocked it outta the park all summer, keeping us supplied with ice even when the fridge broke down (landlord found a dude who still had some old R12 in his shop to FIX the thing, so the Refriga-Beast remains!

also, it will accommodate a gallon jug of water on top. It shuts off when full or out of water. I would recommend using filtered water - just a personal preference.

MY INITIAL EXPERIENCE:

First, be easy on this machine. It is not a typical residential washer. Just because you can stuff the wash tub and spin tub to capacity doesn’t mean that won’t break the machine. This takes some patience and some getting used to. If you overload it, it’s going to break. If the clothes don’t move and agitate freely in the wash tub, it’s overloaded. If the spin tub knocks, it’s off balance. Any washer does this when a load is off balance.

CHECK YOUR MACHINE before you use it just to be sure the wash tub and spin tub are clean inside. I believe my machine was either a return from another buyer, or else it had dampness inside the wash tub for some other reason. There was a LOT of mildew inside the wash tub around the top when I unboxed it. If I wasn't so big on inspecting things, I would not have seen it until probably much later, and I would have assumed it was from dampness after my own use.

I cleaned off the mildew using a disinfectant cleaner and a sponge, and it came off completely. I was OK with that, even though I remain a bit annoyed at having to clean up a mess before I could use what I had assumed that I bought new. I don't know for a fact that my machine was a return. All I know is that there was mildew inside. It could theoretically have come from being stored in a humid environment, I suppose.

WHAT TO EXPECT FROM ITS PERFORMANCE:

This is a LIGHT-duty washing machine, and it works perfectly fine for what it is. Although it says that it dries, what they really mean is that it spins. This is NOT a washer dryer combination machine, but I knew that when I bought it. It spins shockingly well. Clothes come out very much like they do with a full size machine. I'm super happy about that. Wringing out wet clothes sucks, and I don't have to do that. Because I am a fusser, I did lift the lid while it was spinning. I was happy to learn that the spin cycle shuts off if you lift the lid. If it's unbalanced, you can lift the lid and adjust the clothes.

This machine does spin, but not in the wash tub. When you drain the wash tub you will need gravity. The spin tub is separate -- the washing side of the machine where most of the water is does not spin.

If you put the machine inside a bathtub, you'll want to elevate it with something. That will keep water from running under the machine and risking electric shock or ruining the machine. I set mine on a platform beside the bathtub and dropped the drain hose over into the tub. It works fine that way.

If you have ordinary loads, this machine will handle them. If you wash a lot of jeans and sweatshirts, plan to spend a lot of time babysitting your laundry. You'll have to do them in multiple VERY small loads (one or two pieces per load) or else you'll burn up the motor and your clothes will not come clean because the machine won't be able to agitate them. Even if the amount of clothes will fit, the machine won't clean them if you add several heavy pieces. I'm looking at you, Levis and hoodies.

My first load was several small pieces. It washed totally fine. I washed several pairs of socks, several pairs of underwear, three basic T shirts, one short nightgown, and a couple of small hand towels together. The machine handled this load with ease.

On my second load, I washed two pairs of size 12 (American) women's Levis, and that is all. The machine did not like this load one little bit. It struggled HARD to agitate them. I added more water than I should have just to free up the clothes a bit and take some of the burden off of the motor, and I watched the machine like a hawk the whole time. I will wash jeans one-at-a-time from here on out. The spin cycle was fine spinning out one pair of jeans at a time.

This machine will not handle adult blankets and other similar heavy things. The wash cycle won't agitate them, and you'll burn up the motor trying. It should work fine for a basic set of full size sheets. I'll be finding out later today. :)

Spinning the clothes is interesting. If you wash what this machine considers a full load, which is much smaller than a full load in a big machine, you can wash them all together. But when you spin them, you'll need to spin a few pieces at a time. I broke up my first load into three groups. The spin tub is about half the size of the wash tub.

HOW TO USE IT:

The instruction booklet will give you the most basic of basic information, but it will not really tell you how to use the machine. You will want to watch some review videos (videos are priceless, trust me) and read reviews if you really want to know how to make it work in the real world. I would have made a video, but my bathroom is too small. I watched several videos before I used it the first time, so I had a basic understanding of the machine. This is definitely a participation-required kind of laundry experience. But that works for me because I've always been fussy about washing clothes anyway.

This machine is a twin tub. It has one tub for washing, and a separate tub for spinning. The instructions do not really explain exactly how to do this. I developed my own method.

First, I fill the wash tub using the fill hose (it worked for me), and add detergent. I only used about 1/4 of the amount of detergent that I'd use in a big machine. I fill the tub to the ""H"" level marked inside the tub and add my clothes. Close the lid, turn the ""Select Switch"" dial (the one that says Soft, Standard, and Drain). Soft is for a gentle wash. Then turn the ""Wash Timer"" dial for anywhere from a 1 to 15 minute wash. The instructions tell you to turn on the machine before you begin. There is no power switch. Trust me, I looked. Turning the Wash Timer dial starts the machine. Only turn the dial clockwise, and don't try to force the timer back or ahead once it has started.

The machine will NOT automatically drain when the cycle ends. The cycle will stop, then you'll need to manually turn the ""Select Switch"" to the Drain settling. Water will come pouring out of the drain hose. I have my machine sitting on a platform beside the bathtub so gravity helps the water drain out.

After those steps are done, move some of the clothes over into the spin tub. Put the little plastic cover over the clothes and press down on it a little. The cover is the loose plastic piece with perforations through it. Then close the machine lid. Switch the ""Spin Timer"" dial to however many minutes you like. I tend to go for the five minute spin.

After you've spun out all of the clothes in that load, move everything back over to the wash tub and repeat the steps for washing, except this time you're rinsing. This is where you can add fabric softener, if you like. Then repeat the steps for spinning like before.

ABOUT USING THE FILL HOSE:

I have seen many, many reviews showing that the fill hose won't fit any faucet. I must have lucked out. I unscrewed the aerator at the end of my bathroom sink faucet and removed it, and the end of the fill hose fit over it perfectly fine. No leaks whatsoever. My sink faucet is a high arc style and it's narrow. Your mileage will probably vary. I use one of the water inlets on the machine, because I don't really know what will happen if I use both. The instructions give you zero to go on with that. I just drop the end of the fill hose into the tub and turn on the sink faucet.

If the hose won't fit any of your faucets, you'll need a bucket to fill the machine, or, as I've seen some users do, you could use a shower sprayer or a kitchen sink sprayer.

The instructions say not to use the machine in any damp area, such as a bathroom or kitchen. Really? I would like someone to explain to me how to use a portable washing machine anywhere besides a bathroom or kitchen. I suppose if you have a washing machine hookup, you could use it there. But if you had that, you could probably buy a full size machine from a used appliance store for about the price of this portable one.

All in all, I am happy. The mildew inside my machine was gross, but it didn't ruin my whole day. I'm washing clothes like mad, and I don't have to load up laundry baskets and take them to my mom's house or to a laundromat. It's fussy and it's not a heavy duty machine. But that's OK. My clothes are clean, and that's the whole point.

TIPS:

The drain setting on the Select Switch is only for the wash tub. Any water in the spin tub will always drain automatically. There is no way to prevent the spin tub from draining, even when the wash side of the machine is washing.

When you're at the end of one wash load and spinning out your final rinse water, you can go ahead and start the next load in the wash tub. Just turn the wash dial to your setting so the wash tub will stop draining. The spin tub will still spin and drain while you're washing the next load.

I do not use the fill inlet on the wash side of the tub. I drop the hose into the tub to fill it.

If you can use the fill hose (if it fits your faucet), you can do something kind of cool that big washers do. Connect the loose end of the hose to the water inlet for the spin tub. Start your spin cycle. Then turn on the water for a few seconds at a time. That pours water into the spin tub to flush fresh water through the clothes as they spin. If you leave the water on for too long, it can spray out the top, so be careful about that. I tend to pulse it on and off for a few seconds at a time during the first minute or two of the spin.

If you are concerned about conserving water, you can use this machine like the old twin tubs were designed to be used. REUSE YOUR WASH WATER! :) You'll need to have a laundry basket handy to do this, but it works great for loads that aren't super dirty. Here's how you do it. Wash your first load. When it's done, do not turn the dial to ""Drain."" Leave it where it is. Pick up some of the clothes from the wash tub and squeeze out some of the water into the wash tub. Just enough to keep from dragging tons of water across the machine. Put those clothes into the spin tub and spin them out. When those are done, put them into a laundry basket to get them out of your way. Put your next load into the same wash water as before and turn on the wash timer dial.

If you don't use fabric softener (I use softener for clothes. I do not use softener for towels, because it makes them less absorbent) and if you can use your fill hose, you can do this another way. Wash your load, move it to the spin tub, then connect the hose to the water inlet on the spin tub. Add water as it spins. That way, you can rinse out the wash water as the clothes spin. Once that spin cycle is done, those clothes are washed AND rinsed, so they're completely done. No need to move them back to the wash tub for a full-tub rinse cycle.

If you're lucky and can use the fill hose like I can, you'll want to be careful. It is not sturdy in ANY way. I can already tell that there will be a time before too long when the hose begins to crack at the ends. I'm already looking around for some replacement hose and connectors that I will be able to use when that happens.

FILL HOSE WORK-AROUND:

Not using a fill hose makes this machine a lot less convenient. If the hose will not work for you at all, but you do have a bathroom or kitchen faucet or shower head that's threaded (meaning you can screw on or unscrew to remove the faucet aerator or shower head), you can easily make a hose that will fit.

Unscrew either the faucet aerator (the little tip at the end of the faucet) or remove the shower head. Take the aerator or shower head with you to your local hardware store or big box home improvement store. Talk to someone in plumbing. Most shower heads are universal, but you might want to take it with you just in case. Tell them what you're trying to do. Tell them that you need a connector to fit that size and style of connection so you can connect a standard garden hose to it. If you already know some plumbing, you can do this yourself. If not, they will be able to help you. If you don't know plumbing and grab any connector that you see, you might not get the right size.

At home, you'll twist the connector that they gave you onto the faucet or the shower. Then you'll twist on the end of your garden hose to that connector. A cheap garden hose is probably best. They are smaller in diameter, and will fit the water inlet valves better. Cut off the other end of the hose to shorten the hose and to remove the metal or plastic connector at that end. If the hose is narrow enough, it might fit the water inlet valves on the machine. If not, it will still be a lot more convenient than using a bucket to fill the machine.",positive

That left my husband and me with two choices: Trek to the laundromat weekly, giving up time we'd rather use for fun activities, or find a way to wash our most frequently used clothes at home.

After reading LOTS of reviews, we decided to try this washing machine, and I'm SO glad we did!

The first thing to know is: You'll learn a LOT by reading others' reviews of this washer. I recommend filtering the reviews by looking for reviews featuring the word ""lint."" They tend to include the most information.

Then, here are my best tips and insights to get the most from this wonderful washer...

For us, it makes the most sense to use this washing machine in our bathroom. We've put ours on an old coffee table, so the washer is at a comfortable height and near the tub/shower combo, and we don't have to move it in & out of the tub, or anything like that.

However, the spin/dry cycle can be noisy sometimes, so we've put anti-vibration pads under the legs of the washer AND under the legs of the coffee table. (Recommended: MyLifeUNIT Shock Absorbing Washer Pads, Anti-Vibration Washer Mat Protector for Washing Machine Dryer Treadmill )

Also, I was not impressed with the hose intended to fill the washer through one of the water inlets. So, I inserted that hose into the larger hose (used to drain the water into a sink or - in our case - into the tub), and hot glued a ring around the outside of the hose where the two join. That added length makes draining the water super-easy.

(In nearly two months of steady use, I've only had to reinforce that connection once, and only in a tiny spot.)

In addition, we put a nylon sock - intended to hold a bar of soap in the shower - over the end of the drainage hose combo, so our tub's drain doesn't get clogged with lint. Initially, there was a LOT of lint coming off our socks and knit clothing.

For most loads, I fill the washing machine tub about half full. That seems to work best to get everyday dirt out of fabrics.

Then, I add water to the washer with our hand-held shower head, noting that the water shouldn't be super hot in this washing machine. (Note: There is a drain near the top of it, so the water won't accidentally overflow.)

I turn the washing machine on, and - as the clothes are moving back and forth - add laundry detergent. Use less than you expect to need. A little goes a very long way.

(Biggest surprise: Seeing how much dirt came out of our clothes during the first couple of washings. Apparently, the washing machine in our old apartment was NOT doing a very good job. I LOVE how clean our clothes are, now.)

Like another reviewer suggested, I sometimes wash the clothes for the longest time (15 minutes), let the clothes sit (in the same water) for about 20 minutes, and then run it - in the same water - through another wash cycle. If the clothes are extra-dirty, that extra wash cycle really helps.

Then, I remove the clothes, wringing them out, lightly, and place them in the spin dryer. (And, of course, drain the water from the washing tub.)

Tip: Fill the spin dryer halfway, at the most, and try to balance the weight of the items evenly. Jam the white plastic grid down firmly, and then turn the spin cycle on for just a few seconds.

- If the spin cycle makes terrible clunking noises, stop the spin cycle immediately. Readjust the clothes (or remove a couple of heavy items) and try again.

- If it makes just a few rocking noises, wait and see if it balances itself. If not, readjust the clothes and try again.

Once you're sure the load is well-balanced, dial the spin cycle to 1, 2, or 3. More than that doesn't seem to make much difference. Generally, I'm happy with 1 for this part of the process. (Note: Each dial can be reset to a longer time, but if you change your mind and want to dial it down to a shorter time... that doesn't seem to work. So, start with a cycle that's shorter than you think you may need.)

Then the clothes go back into the washer for a rinse cycle, followed by another spin-dry cycle before we hang the clothes on a drying rack. (For this spin cycle, I often dial it up to 3 minutes, to get the clothes as dry as possible.)

We've been using this washer three or four times a week, for about two months. I'll admit that this is time-consuming, and a little annoying to shuffle the clothes back and forth between the washing side of the machine and the spin dryer.

But compared with having to buy more clothes or spend hours more at a laundromat... I'm delighted to use this washer.

It's holding up well. Everything is still working like new. Our clothes seem to be cleaner than ever.

The only disappointment has been trying to wash heavy clothes like denim jeans, etc. Though the washing machine seems to get them clean, the spin dryer balks at a super-heavy load like that. And I don't have the patience to keep readjusting the load to keep the machine from rocking.

Other reviewers say they're washing jeans in this machine, but for me, it makes the most sense to save the heaviest clothes for a single trip to the laundromat every few weeks.

If you're looking for a small, affordable washing machine for your apartment or RV, this is the machine to get. I give it a full five stars for providing excellent value and convenience. And, as I said earlier, our clothes have never been cleaner.",positive

You just have to lower or use the drain hose and do not switch the Selection knob to drain. Keep it on standard. Move your water hose over to rinse side and set timer and allow spin basket to adjust. Do not continue if the basket is off balance. Stop machine immediately and adjust the clothes. Turn the timer off! This usually works after one adjustment. Example towels I did one at time and just pour the towel into spin basket Loosely and then place the spinner guard on top. Do not smash down and then turn on timer. Once water hose is hooked up and timer is on ans basket is balance and the spinner reaches high speed turn on water and let it rinse for about 30-45 second and turn water off and then repeat as needed. I did this twice and clothes came out fine.

Spinner doesn’t do well with constantly adding rinse water. Just short burst of water and then repeat. I do two burst of Water for the rinse in the spinner side. Then reset timer for full 5 min. Clothes come out close to dry. Will not dry clothes completely. Most clothes will dry on hanging rack or hanging within 1 hour or so.

Rinse and spin works great to remove detergent. Wished it came with longer drain hose! Great for small living spaces. Not very loud at all. Washes clothes and gets them clean!

Machine will get hot if used for back to back loads. Recommend that you only use it for no more than 3 loads on the 15 min wash cycle. I’ve used it for 4 loads and seems to get really hot at the base where the motor is located.

I set my machine up on sturdy folding table and used non slip grip pad to help hold machine in place Set 5 gallon buck along side to drain water out and just empty bucket after draining the water from the washer and then replace empty bucket back for use on the spin side.

Washing small loads daily or every other day has saved me trips to the laundromat.

This machine is perfect for washing children’s clothes. I have a 2 year old who spills or get clothes soiled and it works great to set it up and wash his clothes before stains set in.

Tip 1. Don’t use a lot of liquid detergent as the machine makes great use of small amount of soap

Tip 2. If washing clothes that aren’t too soiled you can Simply pull the clothes out and move them to the spin side and rinse with water and keep the wash water and use for 2nd load to save on water and soap. Example wash lightly soiled clothes and then wash whites and add small amount of bleach just about and an ounce or so to wash water and add little bit more water and your good to go for the second load. Your saving water and soap

Overall very satisfied with this purchase for the money. I feel the machine could be made a little better but over all very satisfied.

With the rising cost of gas and travel to the laundromat. The machine should pay for itself in short amount of time.",positive

We washed everything including sheets and towels. The only trick is figuring out how much you can put in at one time without overloading the machine. The one thing that I say is a hassle is the spinner and that’s because you really have to balance the clothes perfectly so it doesn’t knock knock knock and sound like it’s gonna break. But other than that once you’ve got the clothes in there the way the machine likes it It’s a real gem.

We have a small apartment and this fits in our small bathroom just fine. We love the convenience. It takes maybe 20 minutes to do the whole wash and spin cycle. Then we just hang up the clothes right in the shower and put a fan on and within just a little bit of time our clothes are smelling fresh air clean and dry. A lot goes to the spin cycle because it really does a great job getting all the water out.

When we first got this in the box we were really excited it was put together so no assembly needed we just plugged it in and started washing clothes right away. We didn’t have to read any instructions it was pretty straightforward.

We tried a few different ways to wash the clothes with the different cycles they have. Like on our clothes that we don’t want to be roughed up too much we use the soft cycle. It’s also got set a 15 minute timer to wash the clothes which we do a load with the minimum detergent because we realized if used to much the clothes get really stiff. And sometimes if that happens where we put too much detergent will just wash it the first time drain all the water out and then put water back in and do another cycle and then drain it so that it gets more soap out. We also decided to start using softener and that helped With the stiffness we incurred a lot too.

We also would make the suggestion that when you get this machine you put it on some thing, we used milk crates. Just two of them and I guess that’s pretty much how you can visualize how big the machine actually will be. Honestly it doesn’t fit on the whole two milk crates but about 1 1/2. We have it up on the milk crates because we had to run the hose differently because it didn’t fit on our faucet. So since we don’t attach it to the sink or the faucet we fill up a bucket and it usually takes three buckets to put in the washer for a big load.

Usually we can wash like six shirts and two pairs of pants and all of our undergarments in one load. It takes about five loads though to spin them because you want to put it in exactly balanced otherwise you have to keep shutting it off and re-organizing the load so putting in like maybe two shirts and a pair of pants or all your undergarments at one time or just maybe a few T-shirts at one time and one pair of jeans sometimes I’ve done that put just one pair of pants in so that it doesn’t knock or unbalance and it gets done in the five minutes just right. It’s easy for my fiancé to use to we both can do our little lot loads every day if we want to.

We don’t pay for water so I can’t tell you what the water bill would be as far as an increase but it doesn’t take much more than a shower would if even more water than one does at all.

It literally was the best investment it’s better than going down to the laundry mat paying for an Uber to get there paying $10 for a load of laundry and wash and dry pretty much we saved all that we would’ve spent on this washing machine in the past three months alone it has paid for itself for sure. My suggestion is if you got a small place and it’s just you and another person this is great.

I wouldn’t use it for more than two people though just because that’s a lot of standing around waiting for it to wash and dry and hang when you could just go to the laundromat and get it done if it’s that many people with that many clothes. If you stay up on it it doesn’t get out of hand.

I really can only wash two towels at a time but I can only dry one by itself and our towels are the large kind of towels. Meaning they’re pretty much bigger than the standard towel.

When it comes to noise this is Machine is super quiet. The only time is loud and I mean super loud like it’s going to blow up is when you put the clothes once again in the wrong way on the spin sideAnd you’ll know immediately if it’s unbalanced trust me. It’s a simple fix but it is loud.
It’s not too big and it’s not too small… it’s just right.",positive

Pro: affordable, compact, decent load size
Cons: more time consuming than traditional washer, awkward hosing connections, may require some handyman skills

This is not a full sized washing machine. It will not perform the same. It does not offer the same level of convenience. That's ok, I'm not comparing this to a full size washing; In my head I'm comparing it to doing all my laundry at a laundromat.

I'm a single person who found myself renting a house without a washer and dryer for the first time in my life. Knowing I would move again in a year and not wanting to deal with the hassel of a full sized washer and dryer (also being incredibly cheap) a portable washing machine seemed like a good enough idea.

For price comparison I see used washing machines (that the seller states work) listed on facebook marketplace for around $100-200. National average for a laundromat is $6 a load so roughly $36 a month for me (maybe less if I stop sorting my laundry). Renting a washing machine from rent a center is like $60ish/month. So from a price standpoint, at $150 this device is priced very fair.

Now onto the machine itself. The directions are ok, but it is a learning curve. Part of that learning curve is I just had no idea how much goes on inside a washing machine normally. Essentially you are doing a bunch of steps that would normally be automated manually. You don't just get to set it and forget it. You manually fill the machine with water (which has the added benefit of giving you a lot of control over water volume and temperature). You then have to manually progress your clothes through all the stages of being washed. The user manual recommends the following steps for washing clothes: wash; spin; rinse; spin. I personally have just been doing wash, rinse, spin and found my clothes get clean without detergent residue ( I then hang dry my clothes in case you're curious). I also put mine on a box because I use it in the bathroom and the drain hose works better if it is flat or elevated to the thing youre draining into (a very a-duh thing but there was some wishful thinking on my part at one point).

As far as capacity inside the washing portion I can fit a full sized fitted sheet, full sized flat sheet, and two pillow cases no problem. It is and will always be annoying that the spin half is smaller than the washing half. But I realize the alternative is building a bigger machine which would be counter to my goal of having a small portable machine.

There are a couple other things I wish were different. I also wish the hoses were longer. I realize that this machine was designed for small spaces and so I actually don't consider a design flaw that the hoses are on the shorter end but it is inconvenient for me none the less. The sink hose also does not attach well to my faucet. I can get it on but I have to stand there and hold it. This really sucks because based on how my bathroom is set up and how the hoses and outlet come out I can't really see into the machine as it is filling. But it is honestly a plastic hose and I am confident I can find a remedy at a hardware store.

Another thing, when I first opened the box it would turn on but not wash. Following the user guide one of the trouble shooting tips is to tighten some bolts inside the machine. Its a little confusing because there are no pictures in the user manual to better explain this, but on the back of the machine there is a panel. If you unscrew the three bolts at the bottom you can then remove the panel. You can now see inside your machine and should see (on your left) the device for rinsing and (on your right) the device washing (it will have a belt). There were some bolts that helped connect these devices to their respective bins above. The bolts didn't feel loose, but I loosened them and tightened them and suddenly everything worked so I have no other explanation. Unplug the machine before you do this unless you liked getting shocked (this is not speaking from experience just a rudimentary understanding of electricity). I did message the company while I was still trying to fix this issue and they responded within 24hrs which is always a nice touch, though I had fixed it by then.

All in all this device accomplishes what I want it do, which is wash my clothes in an affordable way that does involve me becoming responsible for a heavy piece of machinery. If you're washing clothes for a family of five this is probably not for you as it would make washing a near full time job (I assume, again I am very much single). But if you wanted to do a few loads a week for your family in your RV, yeah this can do this. If you're a single, cheapskate millennial like me this may also work for you.",positive

I've never used a portable washer before, but my roommates had one that was huge and clunky and it took up a ton of space in our bathroom. I wanted one that does a wash cycle and spin cycle in the same tub. Well, for the size and price I was looking for, that wasn't possible. But this one is a great alternative- it's not too big or heavy, it is a little bulky for a small bathroom but hey it's a clothes washer. What I really like is that it runs well, is mostly quiet, holds more clothes than expected, and seems to actually clean my clothes. I've only used it once so I'll update if anything goes terribly wrong. UPDATE: My only suggestion is not to put too much soap because if the tub gets sudsy, it takes forever to rinse out and the clothes are a pain to rinse all the soap out. But that's more user error than the machine's fault.

I took 1 star off because the water inlet hose doesn't work at all (once the pressure builds up in the hose it just pops of the faucet and water gets everywhere) and because, if the spin tub isn't loaded evenly, it thumps around everywhere and makes a loud sound that feels like the house is falling down. Luckily, I don't have any downstairs neighbors. The spin tub is a bit of a learning curve but I'm starting to get the hang of it and don't see it being a huge issue for me. Plus, it gets the clothes super dry which makes air drying a lot easier.

But overall, I really like this washer and it seems like a perfect little appliance to keep in an apartment so I don't have to pay for laundry or take it to a laundromat. (My landlord charges $1.50 for both a wash and dry, which is ridiculous.) I'm not sure how it will handle winter clothes but for now it looks like it'll do the job I need it to.",positive
462,Appliances,"SUPER DEAL Compact Mini Twin Tub Washing Machine, Portable Laundry Washer w/Wash and Spin Cycle Combo, Built-in Gravity Drain, 13lbs Capacity for Camping, Apartments, Dorms, College Rooms, RV’s and more",$154.99,4,"Like many, I bought this because I live in an apartment with no washer or dryer. Overall, I like it for what it is. However, potential buyers need to keep in mind that they aren't purchasing a fancy washer/dryer- this really can't take the place of a proper set up. For perspective, I use this to wash items that cant wait for me to get to the laundromat and baby clothes.

Here are some things to keep in mind with this item, and honestly others like it (as I don't think it's a brand/quality issue so much as a limitation of this product in general type scenario):

1. To drain the water after rinsing, the hose uses gravity. This means the drain needs at the base or below the washing machine to work. Don't attempt to pick this machine up while full of water. To deal with this, I put this machine in my bathtub while in use.

2. These aren't sturdy items. It is best to have it on the ground rather than on some sort of cart to drain into a sink, if you're thinking of trying that. They also become unbalanced quite easily.

3. The user cannot do a large load or put heavy items in the washer. I can probably fit 1 pair of denim pants in the rinse portion, but they will not fit in the spin cycle, at least not without the washer trying rocket itself off to space. Best to skip the spin cycle for heavier garments all together and just hang dry.

4. The spin cycle gets off balance easily. Make sure to evenly lay out clothes in the drum to get the best results. Also, you will need multiple spin cycles to get through all the clothes in the rinse cycle, as it is much smaller.

5. Be prepared to use a LOT of water. You will need to use multiple rinses to get all the soap out. This take some trial and error to get the right balance. Also, side note, much easier to fill the rinse basin using the shower head than the provided tube.

6. Lint! Invest in a lint roller. Or several. Once your clothes are dry they will need a good rub down with one of these.",positive

If you're thinking of buying a portable washer/dryer, do yourself a favor and just BUY THIS NOW. I recently moved across the country from a condo with my own automatic washer/dryer to a small apartment in AZ, with on-site laundry, but no in-unit laundry hookup. Our laundry room had no air conditioning for around 2 months, due to a missing part and supply chain delays. Out of desperation for a solution to not have to deal with excessive heat in the laundry room, or the ever increasing machine fees, I decided to purchase this washer. I DON'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T BUY THIS SOONER. This little machine works SO well. I've only had it for around a week, but I've already washed 5 loads of laundry.

This machine can hold a surprising amount of clothes in the main wash tub, despite the size. The spinner portion is much smaller, and can only hold a few items at a time. I set mine up in the kitchen, on top of a milk crate, as I don't have an outlet in my bathroom. (I plan on purchasing an extension cord so I'm able to just drain water right into the tub.) I drain the water into a bucket for the time being. The gravity drain has given me no issues using this method. I cannot stress how quiet this machine is. My super quiet tower fan (also from Amazon) is louder than this machine. As another reviewer noted, the spinner portion requires the load in both the main wash tub and the spinner tub to be even, for the spinner to function properly. It's a bit of trial and error, but you get the hang of it. The spinner gets the clothes almost completely dry. Since I live in a hot, dry climate, I hang my clothes on my balcony for about an hour to finish drying.

Long story short, I love this washer. It stores easily in a closet, is quiet, and is SO much better than walking to the laundry room. It's easy to stay on top of laundry these days. Dare I say, I actually have fun using this little machine. Yes, it's a bit more work than an automatic machine, but man, this has been an absolute game changer.",positive
464,Appliances,"SUPER DEAL Compact Mini Twin Tub Washing Machine, Portable Laundry Washer w/Wash and Spin Cycle Combo, Built-in Gravity Drain, 13lbs Capacity for Camping, Apartments, Dorms, College Rooms, RV’s and more",$154.99,3," While I am not going to come right out and say this is a perfect solution to living spaces without laundry machines, I will start by saying I would recommend this machine to an individual looking for a way to do regular laundry in a small apartment. If you live alone, and do not have a lot of laundry to clean this machine will certainly be a convenient way to stay at home and clean towels, clothes, and other small-medium items. I have used this machine for several weeks now and I am definitely happy with my purchase. While it is nice, there are things to keep in mind if you are deciding to purchase this machine. For starters, be very careful how much detergent and fabric softener you use. I have found that less is more in this case, and tend to put in a really small amount of both detergent and fabric softener (not at the same time). To get an idea of how I use this machine; I will do 30 mins for the first wash, with detergent. I use warm water. I will then do a rinse cycle with cold water, and fabric softener. Again a very small amount of fabric softener. I have noticed that if you see soap forming on the top of the water it means you may have put in too much detergent/ fabric softener. In my experience, this will lead to a situation where it will be very hard to get all the soap out of the things you are cleaning in a sane amount of cycles, especially if they are towels. If you are allergic to detergents and or softeners this will cause a problem. I am not terribly allergic, but with the first few washes irritated my sinuses. So use as little as you can, they still come out smelling clean and smelling good with just a small amount. I will sometimes do a second rinse cycle if the water is still coming out soapy or dirty. Then I will put the clothes on a hanging rack to dry. This brings me to another consideration. The drying process. Towels will be stiff and scratchy if you let them air dry on a rack. I however, have been able to get soft towels and clothes by putting a space heater underneath the rack pointing upwards. This hot air mimics a dryer, and has given me soft towels again. Otherwise, expect stiff towels. Even if you use a very small amount of detergent, towels come out stiff if you air dry. I recommend rotating towels around every 30 mins to get a better result w/ the space heater. Clothes seemed to come out soft no matter what, but it is something to consider, because who doesn't like soft towels and clothes? This machine requires a water inlet, so if you don't have a way to use the included hose, the best way to fill the machine is with a shower head. This is easier with a head attachment with a hose. I find this to be a fine work-a-round. If you pay for the water at your place, you may not like the amount of water it requires. This may become more of an expense than it is worth. I recommend getting the machine on a metal table, I put the machine on a foldable metal table in the shower, and this also helps with not having to bend over, or worrying about water getting into the electronics of the washer. The whole reason I got this machine was to stay home, instead of leaving home to do laundry. I am a college student, and want to have this here so I can better focus on studying during the week. Now I really wish the machine had a longer timer, and maybe there's a hack to extend it, but overall if you find a groove this can save you time and only takes a max of two hours (not including the drying process). It just takes a little more tending to then I would like. The last thing that I will mention is that this machine is tough on the things you wash. Other customers have noted that it can stretch out clothes. This is true, this machine is tough on fabrics. I have noticed maybe one or two pieces of clothes that became damaged, but I don't see it as a reason to stop using it. Eventually I will be living in a home with a washer and dryer. Remember that this is a temporary fix, and as far as temporary fixes go, I am really impressed. I would also buy a lint trap for the drain hose, and a lint catcher that goes in with the clothes. This all helps with getting hair, and other fibers out of the clothes. I am noticing a build-up however, on clothes of fibers. So that's another downside. Still overall, this machine is pretty great for specific situations. If this description sounds anything like the situation you are in, then I totally recommend. I hope this helps, and I wish you all the luck in your clothing cleaning journeys! Lol.",fair

466,Appliances,"Frigidaire EFIC452 40 Lbs per day Extra Large Clear Maker, Makes Square Ice",$166.82 - $179.00,5,"I searched for a counter-top ice machine when my refrigerator ice maker failed and I really didn’t like the ice it made anyways – half moon, cloudy, sediment filled soft ice. The choice became chewable nuggets, more half moons or cubes. Since I use ice primarily for iced tea, lemonade and cocktails, I wanted clear cubes. Hence, this was my choice and I picked Frigidaire for the brand.
My choice was also influenced by the ratings. However, I read all the negative reviews as well.
Unboxing: Mine arrived undamaged with no signs of prior delivery, unpacking or use. It was new. Unpacking was easy. It’s good looking.
Manual: Poorly written, confusing, and only makes sense after playing with the machine.
Plastic ice scoop: Awkward to use when retrieving ice and can’t break up the sheets of cubes. I replaced it with stainless steel ice tongs.
Set-up: I waited the recommend hour of upright standing before I plugged it in. I filled the top tank with bottled drinking water – not distilled. I positioned it on my counter with plenty of breathing space behind it. It does put out warm air in the back when making ice.
Sound level: Surprisingly very quiet. Also, the machine only runs when it is in the producing cycle.
Ice product: It makes clear sheets of 24 ice cubes, each cube 7/8” square. The dimension of each cube remains constant, but you can change how full each cube is with a setting from -6 to +6. The +6 fills the cube completely but is a very solid sheet. The -6 you can poke your finger in the exposed, indented side (the only side that is not touching a cooling element). I chose +4 and like the result.
Ice making is fast, about 15 minutes a sheet on +4.
When the cycle completes, the sheets fall out of the freezing element into the bin (called harvesting) and generally remain intact, i.e., the cubes do not separate. The sheet of cubes, however, is easily broken with a small ice pick, knife handle or your ice tongs.
The ice is clear and cold and does not rapidly melt. It looks great in your drinks. It lasts.
Some people apparently just run the machine to make sheets of ice which they put in bags and put in their freezer and break up in the bag when they are going to be used. My intent is to keep the machine on and for it to constantly supply ice on demand. But I have also stored some sheets in my freezer in pint ziplocks.
Issues: Sometimes the ice sheet does not fall all the way down if the bin is full or will trigger the “full bin” mechanism (stop making ice) even if the bin is not full. The mechanism is a lever the ice sheet is supposed to depress when it falls if the bin is full. This is easily rectified by just rearranging the ice in the bin. However, you do have to check the machine occasionally for this. I had one occurrence when the frozen sheet did not completely separate from the freezing element yet triggered the full bin lever. The machine stopped making ice and the ice in the bin melted overnight, leaving water in the bottom of the ice bin. Solution: move the partially melted sheet to the bin and the ice making resumes, quickly using all the water in the bin for fresh ice.
Icons: There are 2 icons, one telling you the ice bin is full and that ice making has stopped and the other telling you to add water. The add water icon only goes on when there is no water in the back reservoir where you add water nor in the bottom tank. Melted ice water is recycled from the bottom tank to make new ice.
Timer: There is a timer function, but I have no idea why anyone would use it.
Ambient temperature: The displayed temperature is warmest when making ice and coldest when not. It has nothing to do with room temperature. Not sure what it is for.
Useful life: I don’t see any indication of the machine being short-lived. But I bought the $20 four year warranty just in case.
Bottom line: It makes cold, clear, cubed ice. The small inconveniences of having to break up the ice sheets or monitor the machine are worth it. Next best alternative: bagged Crystal ice from the grocery store.",positive
467,Appliances,"Frigidaire EFIC452 40 Lbs per day Extra Large Clear Maker, Makes Square Ice",$166.82 - $179.00,5,"PROS

Frigidaire's EFIC452 XL Maker is the perfect way to make large quantities of ice quickly and easily. Its 2.3 liter reservoir can produce up to 40 lbs. of clear squared ice cubes per day, making it ideal for parties or other events where you need a lot of ice. The high-efficiency design means that it can make 24 perfectly squared ice cubes in less than 15 minutes and stores up to 2.4 lbs. at a time. The first batch of ice will take longer because the ice maker refrigerant needs time to cool the water, but after that it will be much faster. The electric ice maker is also designed to be quiet and runs on just 120 watts, making it both energy efficient and unobtrusive. The user-friendly electronic controls make it easy to use, and the modern design with its large through-window lets you watch your ice being made at all times.

CONS

While 2.4 pounds of ice in one hour may seem like a lot, it can easily be depleted if there is a large demand for ice. The room's ambient temperature is important for the ice maker because it helps regulate how quickly it can produce ice. If the room is too hot, the ice maker will work slower. A consistent ambient temperature in the room will help ensure that the ice maker produces as much ice as possible in a timely manner. As we learned the hard way, running the icemaker on the countertop over a dishwasher is a bad idea because it will heat up the ambient temperature, making it difficult for the ice maker to produce ice. The dishwasher produces a lot of heat, making it more difficult for the icemaker to cool down and produce ice. Even though it can produce up to 40 lbs. of ice cubes per day, the EFIC452-SSRED XL Maker's reservoir only holds 2. 3 liters, so it fills up quickly. This means that you'll have to constantly monitor the ice maker to ensure that there is always a fresh batch of ice cubes being made. If the reservoir is full and there is no more room for ice, the machine will stop producing ice until space becomes available.

What we find works for us is we start making ice a few days before a big party and fill up ziplock bags of ice. That way, we have plenty of ice on hand and don't have to worry about running out. Plus, it's really easy to just grab a bag of ice from the freezer when you need it. Overall, we think the Frigidaire EFIC452-SSRED XL Maker is a great ice maker for those who need a lot of ice, but just make sure to plan ahead.",positive

I have two kids in travel sports so we use a lot of ice. I’ve only had it for about a day now and this is my first ice maker to ever purchase so I can’t compare to others. So far…
Pros: easy to set up and use, makes ice pretty fast, I preferred cubes/blocks of ice to freeze in ice bags to use for coolers and these seem to be perfect for that, makes a good bit of ice with one full tank of water, ice stays in the container without melting too fast. Left ice in there overnight and it’s basically all still there into the next day.
Cons: ice comes out in sheets and but they break apart pretty easy using the ice scoop, If I was using this mainly for drinks I don’t think I would like it too much due to the ice in sheets, but like I said I’m using it to make ice to freeze for coolers and so far it seems like it’s going to be good for that. I filled a 10 lb bag of ice in one day. Could have been quicker if you really checked
It and emptied it as soon as it filled up.

Overall: so far I think it’s worth the money for my particular use. I went with this one because of the brand name I am familiar with and had pretty good reviews. I’ll update later if I have any issues as I begin to bag the ice.",positive

Since I figured it would be nice to use this to make ice in a home bar after she was done with it, I bought this unit.

This unit works by dribbling water over a vertical metal grid that looks like an ice cube tray. The metal is cooled and the water freezes as it pours over the grid. The longer you let the water flow, the more completely the ice cube forms within the grid. You can adjust the thickness of the ice within the grid by a setting on the touchscreen. I set mine to maximum to get solid, clear cubes. When the freezing is done, the water stops flowing and the ice cubes are pushed as a ""block of cubes"" into a bin.

The Good:
- If you use filtered water, the ice is indeed clear and doesn't have those annoying hollow ""holes"" in the ice that I associate with cheap ice makers
- The product looks great. I really like the red and black coloring, and it looks good, not cheap.
- It will make 40 lbs of ice in a day if you are diligent about emptying the ice cube bin frequently.
- The ice maker makes about the same amount of noise as a dorm fridge. There is certainly a fairly loud clunk each time a sheet of ice falls into the tray, but the overall ice-,making process was less loud than I expected.

The Bad:
- The ice cube bin holds maybe 4 or 5 ""sheets"" of ice before it fills up and the machine stops. Since the bin is not cooled, the ice starts to immediately melt unless it is taken out and placed in a freezer or cooler.
- That means about every hour or so, you must go into the machine and remove the ice and put it somewhere cold if you want to max out on the ice production. It would have been much nicer if the holding bin kept the ice cold.

The ugly
- If you fill the unit with water and let it run overnight, you will wake up to 4 or 5 sheets of mostly melted ice in the tray.
- The ice machine works well, but is a bit difficult to drain completely during cleaning. I worry that you could easily leave some water behind which might lead to mold.

Overall Grade: I give this a B+ overall, I used the heck out of this thing for almost two months. I bought some ice machine descaler and cleaner, and cleaned it once during my ice-making marathon. Cleaning and descaling was a breeze. I would have given this a perfect A+ if the ice holding tray area could keep the ice from melting.",positive

After my fridge ice maker broke I thought I was going to be a slave to buying ice since otherwise my fridge was perfect. Enter this beautiful find and I have been using the heck out of it for almost 3 months now. It runs almost all day several times a week and it is a champ. Couldn’t be more pleased with the quality of this product. It is so quiet we have been known to forget it’s on. Highly recommend if you are a big ice family like mine,positive
471,Appliances,"Frigidaire EFIC452 40 Lbs per day Extra Large Clear Maker, Makes Square Ice",$166.82 - $179.00,4,This is a nice little ice maker. People have said it is noisy but I don't find it that bad. It's very handy for parties and for when my wife uses up all the ice in the fridge to make her smoothies. The only downside is that it makes these large racks of ice cubes that can be a pain to break up. The scoop that comes with machine sucks so buy a metal one.,positive
472,Appliances,"Frigidaire EFIC452 40 Lbs per day Extra Large Clear Maker, Makes Square Ice",$166.82 - $179.00,4,"I have now had this for 7 months and found a more than a few pros and cons.

I'll get the company, and not the machine, related stuff out of the way right now. First unit I was sent leaked water from some spot and at first I wasn't sure if this was condensation or what. I returned the first unit because whether or not that was a defect I wasn't going to use a machine that leaked all over the counter no matter what. Second machine arrived and NO leaking at all. So the first unit was in fact defective. However, second unit was obviously a USED machine! I kept the second machine (maybe a poor choice) because it at least did not leak, and the 'used' factor was only noticeable really due to the water spots and a bit of grime in the reservoir. Nothing major, just a good cleaning before any real use, was required.

Let's start with the pros:
Clear ice (keep that machine clean though)
Sheets of ice that last (melting is slow)
Adjustable time to make thicker sheets (cubes)
I run this a few hours every day. 7 months, every, single, day.

Cons:
Most noticeable is the cleaning factor. I have smallish hands for a guy and I still can't reach areas well enough to give this thing a deep clean.

That's really it for cons I suppose. There are some things I can nit pick if anyone cares. Read on if that's the case.

Included scoop is useless. This thing makes 'sheets' of ice that laugh in the face of this minuscule scoop thingy. (not a big deal, but if this kind of thing is important to you, maybe just buy one of those bullet ice machines)
Other people seem to know how much ice this can make with X amount of water. I, however do not. So I would love an option to select X amount of sheets (this thing makes sheets of ice remember) to be made.
Description says it runs on 120watts. Really? I didn't test this with a Kill-o-Watt yet, but I did try and use it with two different portable battery packs that could not handle the initial load. So this thing must spike well over 300watts (seriously, 120watts ??) and only consumes the stated 120 when it's in the 'hey, about to dump this sheet of ice out' stage, or they simply meant it runs on 120v. I'll need to test this for off grid use.

Overall this is a great machine. I'm listening to it in the 'I'm about to dump this sheet of ice out' stage right now as I type. I did encounter a defective initial machine, then the 'here, have a used one' after that, but I am still happy with my purchase. I don't remember the exact reason I chose this over the 'bullet' style machines, but I think it was based on output(?). However, I think I would have been happy either way. Those bullet machines put out individual cubes, which would make the included scoop in this machine actually useful! This machine puts out 'sheets' of ice that you can break up if storing in your freezer or whatever. Personally, I use them in my tumblers. One sheet fits well when broken in half. Solid sheets seem to last longer when used in a cooler for other stuff. I think this all comes down to personal preference but honestly you could simply go with which ever unit was cheaper and be just as happy.

Hope this helps someone reach a decision. Once I get my solar set up in place and see how this machine fits in I'll update my review.",positive

I have a small fridge and only had two ice trays. I used all the ice in one drink and then would have to wait several hours before I could get more ice cubes. Also, they seem to melt extremely fast. So I bought this based off the review that said these ice cubes stay frozen longer and to my shock, they really do. I filled my thermoflask like I usually do with ice and water. Usually the ice melts in an hour. Today, I filled it at 9 am and its now 8pm, and the ice is still full. I don't think any of it melted. I'm horrible at science, so I can't for the life of me, understand how these ice cubes are fresher and last longer than the ice cubes I make in the freezer. I didn't want to spend thus much for an ice machine, but it's one of the few that doesn't form the bullet ice cubes, but it comes out as a square. I love it and I'm glad I didn't go the cheap route and get a cheaper machine. I definitely recommend this!",positive

We have to bag some of it to pop in the freezer and store it. One downs is that it’s a bit noisy but I read that on other reviews and tried it anyway. overall I’d still buy it. It makes ice very fast so even if you don’t need it all the time you could turn it on an hour before needing extra ice and you’d be fine.,positive
