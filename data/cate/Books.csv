0,Books,It Ends with Us: A Novel (1),$10.26,4,"So much hype over this book! I've read dozens and dozens of KU Romances across every genre - billionaire, mafia, same sex, enemies to lovers, second chance, dark, light, everything in between. There is some really good content over there so I finally wanted to see how they compared to one of the best selling romance novels of all time. Selfishly I also wanted to see how Hoover's writing (this is my first of hers i've read) compared to Sylvia Day whose Bared series I loved Books 1-3.

Overall I give this a 4 stars. It didn't completely bowl me over but overall really good. One little admission is that I totally skipped the pages and pages and pages of ""journal entries"" aka back story for Lily and Atlas, and guess what? Still was able to figure out the story just fine :) It came across to me as filler and really slowed the plot down but I know some readers love those juicy details. I just wanted to get back to the main story line and honestly some of the entries were like 12 pages long. If you wanna do the same, I won't tell anybody and I promise you won't be lost.

Spoilers ahead.
This book honestly wasn't as dark as I thought it would be given all the talk of domestic violence. I thought it would be scene after scene, but there were only 3 incidents in the whole book, 2 of which were somewhat unintentional and/or partially happenstance, while the third was just nauseatingly purposeful. Some of the MC (Lily) reactions seemed a little fake or contrived, and especially I DID not like it when she informed Ryle WHILE HE HELD HIS NEWBORN BABY that she wanted a divorce. Surely she could have waited a day? I don't like when books make me dislike a protagonist and up until this very point at the end, I had really liked Lily.

Ryle and his thought processes were right on. Having experience with men with major emotional trauma this really hit home for me and seemed incredibly realistic. There are two types of abusers in my opinion - the ones who are truly mean and don't care that they are hurting others and the the ones with the demons they can't control. Him putting on Lily by saying ""help me"" as though its up to her to heal him was really on point (if very, very wrong - he is responsible for his own healing).

Anyway, overall pretty well done if a little too much filler in the middle of the book. The ending was pretty superb and that Epilogue! I have to admit I was rooting for Atlas the whole time, but I have a weak spot for rescuers. Unfortunately I didn't really get invested in any of the characters enough to want to spend the money or time on It Starts with Us, which starts where EWU leaves off. I think I'll move on to Ugly Love which I heard was steamier and is a little more along my preference lines.

TBH if you are looking for pure drama and emotional angst Sylvia Day's Book 1 of Bared series is going to leave you gasping, its way more fast paced. Unfortunately though the series drops off in quality after book 3, and one thing CoHo fans love is her consistency.

HTH!",positive
1,Books,It Ends with Us: A Novel (1),$10.26,5,"This book.... OHHH my gosh. This book was so heart-wrenching, yet so beautiful at the same time. Coming from someone who has experienced domestic violence in the past it really hits home. When I first bought this book I didn't know what to except, but it wasn't this. It was everything I could've hoped for and MORE. I loved the way she portrayed Lily. She was so courageous, bold, relatable and perfect in all the right ways. I cannot wait for book 2!!! Once I finished, I couldn't stop crying for a whole hour straight. I can't even remember turning pages because it had me hooked that good!! READ IT READ IT READ IT!

*SPOILERS*]

First off, some of these reviews piss me off, especially the ones that are geared toward the main character Lily.

""Why did Colleen have her stay with someone who was constantly abusing her and treating her as so""?
""I was so pissed she got right with Atlas right after the whole thing with Ryle happened, that would not happen in real life...""

First off, if you have ever experienced domestic violence in your life you would know how hard it is to leave the situation. Second, did you even read the book? Lily clearly states her confusion with either staying or leaving. It's not like she was staying with him because she liked the abuse?! Some of yawl's reviews seriously get to me. Imagine falling in love with someone who was absolutely perfect in your eyes and treated you in all the ways you'd ever imagine. You then get tied down... He starts to abuse you... Does things to you that you never thought this man who loved you SO much could possibly do?!? But it happens. It's not that easy to up in leave... If you TRULY knew what it is like to experience domestic abuse you would know that. So please stop getting mad at Lily for taking so long to leave! The whole thing about her getting with Atlas so fast after the whole dealio with Ryle ended, was PERFECT in my eyes. People are getting mad at how quickly she got back with him, but he was her safe place and FIRST true love (who matter-of-fact she never fell out of love with). I would've done the exact same dang thing!",positive
2,Books,It Ends with Us: A Novel (1),$10.26,5,"I have never been inspired to write a book review. This is my first. I read all the critical reviews, but the subject matter of this book hit a very sensitive nerve for me. First of all, for those who thought the book was too sensual or too emotional, I must venture a guess this subject matter is something they have never lived or even thought was possible.
Domestic abuse has many sides and many questions. If you have not been a victim, it might be easy to say,”Why didn’t you leave?” This book answers many questions and explores the victims and abusers viewpoints. The most prominent quotation in this book for me is, “There are no bad people, only people who do bad things.” I believe the circumstances of our childhoods shape us into the adults we become, even more than genetics. The traumas we have to survive and the way we are made to feel about ourselves stay with us.
I was a survivor of my parents abuse of each other. It was not just my father, but also my mother who fought violently with each other. I was able to go to university and leave the trauma physically, but not emotionally.
I married the first man who proposed so I didn’t have to go home.
I withstood his verbal and physical abuse for 28 years. He stopped hurting me before my bruises and choking so as not to send me to the hospital. I stayed with him for 28 years because he was a good father and my daughters loved him.
I loved him because when he was good, he was very good. Was I stupid? Was I afraid to go out on my own? Yes. My children came first. I would endure anything for their safety and happiness.
This amazing book addresses both sides of abuse, from each perspective. The heartbreak of having to decide your future with a man you love with all your heart, who loves you with everything he has in him, but who also has demons he is unable to control.
Please read this book. It will give you sight into this ongoing tragedy between men and women. Withhold your judgment until the end, if you have the wisdom to do so",positive
3,Books,It Ends with Us: A Novel (1),$10.26,4,"*Review originally posted on Goodreads*

'I wish cutting my feelings off for the person who hurt me was as easy as I used to think it would be. Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.'

It Ends With Us was beautifully complicated. It was hot and cold. Up and down. Good and bad. Beautiful and ugly... I'm still trying to figure out how I really feel about it all because I'm genuinely torn on how I want to perceive this storyline. I loved it but in all honesty, I really do think I hate it as well. Not the ""I-hate-you-Colleen-Hoover-stop-writing-books-and-find-a-different-career"" type of hate but rather ""I-hate-you-Colleen-Hoover-for-making-me-hate-everything-that-I-came-to-love"" kind of hate because it pretty much summarizes all my thoughts and feelings about It Ends With Us in one sentence.

My opinions were completely divided. One side of me, the hopeless romantic, was utterly unsatisfied and angry with the outcome of the story. The opposite side, the one that's all about women's empowerment, was cheering on #TeamLily like it was Independence Day.

Rather than trying to sugarcoat my thoughts, I'm just going to be completely honest. I was 100 percent team Ryle from the very first time we met him. Just like Lily, I fell in love with every word and every gesture that rolled off of his body. I. WAS. HOOKED. It also didn't help that I kept fantasizing Doctor Mike as Ryle Kincaid. *heart eyes emoji* I loved his ambition. His personality. His confidence. To be honest, I think I might've loved Ryle even more than Lily did but that's another story for another day. That more than likely explains why I took the second half of this book like a blow to the gut.

Once we got to the second half of the book, that's where it started going a bit downhill for me as a Ryle and Lily shipper. Every happy moment that ever happened between my ship came barreling down as it collided with pain and abuse. I was angry. I was thrashing. I was yelling at the pages in front of me, ""Why are you doing this Colleen?!"" But most importantly, I was just heartbroken to see such a beautiful couple become so toxic. Everything I loved about the first half of the book was slowly unraveling right before my very eyes as if it never really existed in the first place. I can't even remember how many times I wanted to put the book down because my hopeless romantic self just couldn't handle it anymore. But I just kept on reading because I was guiltily hoping that Ryle and Lily would still have their happy ending despite all that had happened. :/ Sadly, this was where I was torn the most.

I have the upmost respect for Lily. She is definitely one of my favorite female characters that Colleen has ever created because she did what a lot of us would've struggled to do in the end: walk away. Lily was such a strong character and I admire her so much for having the strength to stand up for herself. There were numerous times towards the end of the book where I knew I probably would've gave in and forgave Ryle for his actions but Lily was inflexible. She was in a tough position but she put her foot down and demanded better for herself. In the end, no matter if I ship Ryle/Lily or Atlas/Lily, I'm glad that Lily was able to find peace for her and Emmy.

As for Atlas, I liked him but I didn't love him. Definitely nowhere near my love for Ryle. I wasn't exactly rooting for Atlas but I wouldn't have minded if Lily chose him in the end. However, I still very much preferred Ryle regardless. I just felt that Atlas was the typical knight in shining armor. Typical good guy you run to. His background story was interesting but him as a character... not so much. He just felt so ordinary and predictable. I wanted to ship Atlas and Lily because let's face it, the signs were practically being shoved down our throats, and although the relationship between Ryle and Lily was developing, Atlas's presence was a like a thorn on your side you just couldn't shake off. But I just couldn't bring myself to ship them blindly like I did with Ryle and Lily.

Unfortunately, I was too far gone and too far in love with the idea of Ryle and Lily to make room for Atlas and because of that, I'm not sure if I'll ever be fully satisfied with that ending. I was happy that Lily was no longer a victim of domestic abuse. I'm glad that after all that happened between them, Lily and Ryle parted on good terms. I'll forever be heartbroken over the idea of what could've been. And I feel indifferent to Lily and Atlas. Sorry not sorry, Atlas. That basically sums up all my feelings in a nutshell.

To be honest, I was actually feeling a bit more bitter than I'm making it seem after that ending. But after reading the author's note, it really put things in perspective for me and made me look at the story with brand new eyes. I developed a new understanding and appreciation for the story behind the story.

I was dying for Ryle and Lily to have their happy ending. Until the very end, I was still rooting for them. It's such an ugly confession to make especially when the couple you're rooting for is toxic and abusive. And I think I feel this way because I never, and hopefully I never will, had to experience abuse. I don't know what it's like and what goes on in the minds of the abused. Colleen did such an excellent job at creating the perfectly imperfect man that was Ryle. Abuse in books has always been a trigger for me and if it were any other book I think I would've put this book down by the first incident of abuse. But Colleen just made you fall so deeply in love with a character that even you couldn't bring yourself to hate him even if you wanted to. YOU were the Lily of this story. But unfortunately, I don't think my Lily would've had the courage to leave. I really wish I could say that I would leave in an instant, but I think I would honestly be lying to myself. You can tell yourself that if you were in Lily's position you would leave in a blink of an eye, but things wouldn't be as easily said and done if you were the one who was actually experiencing it all. And in truth, I think this is exactly what Colleen wanted us to actually sit down and think about because victims who've experienced abuse wouldn't be rooting for Ryle and Lily. I wouldn't be rooting for Ryle and Lily. It just goes to show how much of a struggle it really is to walk away from someone you love and loves you back in all the wrong ways. I usually never read the author's notes after the book but I'm really glad I took the time to read Colleen's story. It really did make me see the situation from a different perspective.

I'd been having a bad CoHo streak for three books in a row (if you're curious, the books were — in order — Hopeless, November 9, and Too Late) and for a moment there I was beginning to think that I was doomed to never enjoy another book written by Colleen Hoover again. But PRAISE. It Ends With Us restored my faith completely in the CoHo hype. Not that I was ever planning NOT to read any more of Colleen's books! Colleen Hoover is 100 percent my favorite auto-buy author. I will always buy her books no matter if I end up loving them or not, and with good reason because Colleen is such an exceptional writer. It Ends With Us still wasn't able to top Ugly Love as my favorite CoHo book of all time but I really enjoyed this book more than I thought I would.",positive
4,Books,It Ends with Us: A Novel (1),$10.26,5,"so this was my first book that ive read in probably 4 years. i only listen to harry potter at night to fall asleep lol so this was the first real adult book ive really ever read. at first i didnt like it because the first chapter seemed to drag on forever. i felt like i wasnt getting any insight into the characters and the whole plot was just kinda boring until about 1/4 of the way into the book. and then i was hooked. i finished this book in 3 days. i cried so many times because of how beautiful it was, especially lily's love with atlas. but i also cried because of how horrible it was, the abuse with ryle but also with lily's parents. it was just such a beautiful, sad book. i know a lot of people didnt like the journal entries where lily was writing about atlas but i LOVED THEM. the plotline with atlas was my favorite part of the book i LOVE him. his and lily's relationship was so sweet. i cant wait to read more about them in it starts with us. overall a very good read that will have you smiling and then sobbing within minutes. RECOMMEND!!",positive
5,Books,It Ends with Us: A Novel (1),$10.26,5,"This book was something that I believe is the epitome of powerful woman doing what’s better for them and learning from others mistakes. Lily’s character was something I felt was someone I can relate to because I have seen how domestic violence can ruin a person and how hard it is to walk away from that person. It takes a lot of courage to do that, and the way this book’s plot developed was from a girl ready to accept the fate of the beaten house wife , but then she knew this isn’t what she was in Boston for . She wanted better than the future her mother already lived . In my heart of hearts , if you want a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat with the play on words but also can rip ur heart out and cry . then this is the book for you !!!!! plz read <3",positive
6,Books,It Ends with Us: A Novel (1),$10.26,5,"Wow. As a regular reviewer of books, I very rarely read the synopsis of a book before reading it. I was taken completely off-guard with this one. I am probably one of the few who have never read one of her books although I've been hearing the hype for a while. So I started this one with an open mind, like I do most books I read, not knowing what to expect and letting the story take me where I needed to go. I noticed the normal things right away. Her writing style is very good, and the pace of the story is spot-on. I became completely invested by the middle of the story. I was in love with the characters and pulling for the main character and her future. And then, bam, I'm facing the dilemma Lily faces. Because I feel the exact same way she does, and her shock and indecision is mine. I won't tell you any more. Maybe you don't read the synopsis ahead of time either. But I will tell you that this is a book well-worth reading. And reading the Author's Notes afterward, simply said, sent me straight over the edge with recognition. There's a sequel coming in October 2022. I'm there.",positive

Lately I haven’t been reading as much as I once did due to working, raising kiddos, and taking care of the daily household things and when I did find the time to read, I usually entertained the education/self help books. I saw a co-worker reading this a few weeks ago at work and she couldn’t say enough positive things about it. I was a Twilight enthusiast back in middle school and have fond memories of reading that series and escaping from my real-life problems. I decided that life is too serious to use what little leisurely time I had available for reading on just education/self help and the take a dive back to the genre that captivated me back then.

10,Books,Verity,$11.26,4,"Verity opens with author Lowen Ashleigh having a very bad morning. Her mother died the previous week after a year-long battle with colon cancer. Lowen had a difficult relationship with her mother -- ""a direct result of my own mother being terrified of me,"" she relates -- but still brought her to Lowen's apartment and cared for her during the last nine months of her life. Lowen is a sleepwalker and her mother kept her fairly secluded as a child, afraid of what Lowen might be capable of doing during one of many sleepwalking episodes. Now she has left her apartment in New York City for the first time in weeks, summoned to a meeting at her publisher's office by her literary agent, Corey, with whom she was previously in an intimate relationship. Just as Lowen is waiting for a crosswalk light to change, a man steps into the street and is struck by a truck. Lowen is understandably shaken, and the man's blood is splattered on her face and white shirt.

A handsome stranger escorts her into a coffee shop bathroom and literally gives her the shirt off his back. They chat briefly, and Loewn concludes that he ""wants to be invisible in this city. Just like me."" After all, she moved to New York to become part of the city's invisible millions of invisible residents. Her books have not sold well enough for her publisher to offer her another contract unless she agrees to promote them, something she has refused to do in the past. ""I'm so awkward I'm afraid once my readers meet me in person, they'll swear off my books forever,"" Lowen laments. ""That's why I stay home and write. I think the idea of me is better than the reality of me."" But another contract was her last hope. She took time off from her writing career believing that her mother would leave her some money. Now, having lived off the advance she received after signing her prior contract, she has learned that she will receive nothing from her mother's estate. And be homeless soon, unless she receives a job offer.

When Lowen arrives at her publisher's office, she is shocked to find the man whose shirt she is wearing is attending the same meeting. He is Jeremy Crawford, husband of Verity, a very successful author who is unable to complete the series of books she was writing. Lowen is being offered a flat fee of seventy-five thousand dollars per book to write the last three volumes in the series, with the first installment due in six months. Lowen is determined to turn down the offer until Jeremy informs her that he selected her because Verity read one of Lowen's books and it was among her favorites. She purportedly told Jeremy that they shared a similar writing style and Lowen was destined to be ""the next big thing."" Verity has been catastrophically injured in a motor vehicle accident, following the deaths of both of her daughters, Chastin and Harper, leaving Jeremy to raise their young son, Crew, alone. Lowen ultimately agrees to take on the project.

Lowen makes the six-hour drive to the Crawford home in Vermont, listening to the audio version of the first book in the series en route. She is to spend time in Verity's office, reviewing the research and notes she left there in order to assess how best to approach writing the next book. Lowen meets Crew and learns that Verity's condition is extremely serious. She is in a virtually catatonic state -- uncommunicative and unable to care for herself. Caregivers spend the day in the home, with Jeremy managing at night. Lowen soon discovers that Verity's office lacks organization -- her expansive desk is strewn with stacks from end to end with papers and files, and boxes containing more documents line the walls. Clearly, the process of sorting through it all will take much longer than Lowen originally anticipated. As she begins reading Verity's second book, she realizes the ""books are from the villain's point of view"" and she will need ""time to work myself into that mindset while writing."" Jeremy claims that he has never read Verity's books because he ""didn't like being inside her head.""

Author Colleen Hoover recounts Lowen's story via a first-person narrative, with the story really taking off as Lowen attempts to settles into the Crawford home. She is keenly observant and inquisitive about Verity's writing, as well as her family, and quickly finds herself attracted to Jeremy, who is still married to the incapacitated woman being cared for in an upstairs bedroom. Searching through Verity's office, Lowen stumbles upon a manuscript entitled ""So Be It."" Verity hopes it is an outline for the next book, but it is instead an autobiography drafted by Verity. Reading it is not what she has been hired to do, but she justifies her insatiable curiosity by construing her review of the manuscript as research. ""I need to see how Verity's mind works to understand her as a writer."" Soon she is absorbed in Verity's descriptions of meeting Jeremy, the development of their relationship and the early days of their marriage, as well as her pregnancies and motherhood. The more she reads, the more frightened of Verity Lowen becomes, especially when events she observes appear to be inconsistent with what she has been told about Verity's condition. Nonetheless, Lowen continues returning to the manuscript to better understand the Crawford family's history, and gain insight into Jeremy and Verity's marriage. But Lowen is playing a dangerous game. Verity's purported autobiography is a dark and disturbing confession of Verity's feelings, motivations, and unspeakably vile acts. Lowen believes the manuscript to be an accurate depiction of Verity's life, and concludes that it ""was written by a very disturbed woman -- a woman whose house I currently inhabit.""

Hoover ramps up the tension as Lowen becomes entangled in a budding relationship with Jeremy, influenced heavily by what she is reading in the manuscript. Verity's revelations are horrifying, and as Lowen and Jeremy grow closer, he increasingly opens up to her, sharing details of his life with Verity about which Lowen feigns ignorance. Lowen's suspicions about the accident in which Verity was injured grow. Is Jeremy being completely honest with Lowen? Why is he willing to embark on a new relationship with Lowen when his wife, although injured, is still alive? He claims that he cannot move Verity to a care facility because Crew cannot sustain another loss. While Verity is cared for in their home, Crew can spend unlimited amounts of time at her bedside. Lowen now possesses detailed information about the deaths of Jeremy's daughters. Were their deaths really tragic accidents? Is Crew safe?

Hoover's characters are both fascinating and infuriating. The story is related solely from Lowen's perspective. Her childhood was difficult because of her sleepwalking and the way it detrimentally impacted her relationship with her mother. She has achieved modest success as a writer, but because of her discomfort in social situations, her career growth has been stymied. She accepts the offer to write Verity's next three books because she desperately needs the money, but also because it is an opportunity too good to pass up. But she is confused not only by her burgeoning attraction to Jeremy, but the incongruity between what she has been told about Verity's accident and what transpires in the house. Of course, Lowen's feelings and experiences are colored by the information set forth in the manuscript. Interestingly, Hoover has said that even when she depicts Lowen reading Verity's manuscript, readers are ""still not fully in Verity’s head because we’re always in Lowen’s perspective, reading something she found. When I write a book from one character’s point of view, I rarely think about the story from the other character’s perspectives. Sometimes it’s necessary for certain scenes, but with this book, it was important for me to feel the confusion and fear Lowen felt. So as the author, I had to be completely blind to what was happening from everyone else's perspectives."" Still, as the story progresses, Hoover keeps readers guessing as to how gullible and vulnerable Lowen really is. She believes the manuscript is truthful and accurate, and that Jeremy is not the villain -- if, in fact there is a villain in the Crawfords' story. But could Lowen possibly be opportunistic, calculating, and willing to do anything to be with Jeremy?

Jeremy is equally captivating. He is handsome, charming, successful, and by all outward appearances, a family man who has sustained unimaginable losses who has been able to soldier on only because he has a young son to raise. To be fair, although Verity's prognosis is never affirmatively established, his desire to move on with his life is understandable -- Verity sustained a serious head injury which will, in all likelihood, preclude her from resuming a fully normal life. But was his meeting with Lowen on the street just before the meeting at her publisher's office really just coincidental? Did he intend for her to find the manuscript in Verity's office? Has he been fully aware of its contents all along? About that, Hoover says, ""I’m not sure because I was never in Jeremy’s head."" In other words, readers can draw their own conclusions, based on the evidence Hoover does present.

And what about Verity? Is she selfishly conniving and evil, as the manuscript suggests? Or is she a blameless grieving mother who was tragically injured in a horrific car accident?

The manuscript provides myriad complications. Lowen debates whether she should discuss it with Jeremy. She doesn't believe he is aware of its existence or content. He claimed he never read Verity's books, after all. Lowen learns that Verity was injured when her vehicle hit a tree, but there were no skidmarks on the pavement. She concludes Verity ""either fell asleep or she did it on purpose."" Does it matter to Lowen which scenario is accurate? What conclusion has Jeremy drawn about the cause of the accident?

Putting aside the perspective from which the story is told, no aspect of the story or the characters can be accepted at face value. Hoover includes plot twists so shocking and unnerving that Verity, originally published in 2018, continues to be one of the most-discussed psychological thrillers ever written. (There is even a Facebook discussion group devoted to the book, boasting nearly twenty-five thousand members!) The book is fast-paced, engrossing, and extremely entertaining. The story's pace gradually accelerates with each surprising development and breath-taking revelations of the truth or, perhaps, a manipulated version of the truth. The tale careens to a jaw-dropping conclusion that will keep readers thinking, discussing, and debating Hoover's extremely clever and nuanced tale, as well as her deliciously intriguing and morally ambiguous characters (who may prove themselves to be not as ambiguous as originally thought) for a very, very long time. Hoover says she ""chose the ending because it’s frightening to me. It’s my biggest nightmare For the darkness in the worlds I create as a writer to somehow"" intrude into her real life.

11,Books,Verity,$11.26,5,"Now Colleen Hoover didn’t come to play when she wrote this here book, she didn’t hold nothing, and I do mean nothing back with this book titled “Verity” Now I want to let you know this book has some triggers in it and I want to go ahead and get them out of the way before we get into my review. Some of the triggers in this book are Abortion, Child Violence, Murder just to name a few. Okay now that we have that out of the way lets get started with the book review.
Now when I saw this book be the talk of all thing’s books from Bookstagram, TikTok, and even in my book club and Facebook groups I am in. I was thinking to myself you all are over hyping this book. But baby after reading this book the hype did not miss a beat. This book had me hooked from the moment I opened the book and read the first sentence I was like oh hell what do you all have me reading.
Now Triller books are not my cup of tea, I am a big old scary cat, and I just do not like things that are scary of things that could happen. So, when I was Listing to this book while at work, I was like Oh how am I going to be able to do my work and read this book. I really did not know what to expect when reading this book because I did not know how triller books flow, but I learned the day I picked this here book up.
Now I am not going to go into super detail about this book because it would give it away and I really want you to read this book. This book is very beautifully written and when I tell you Ms. Hoover did not leave a single thing out this book. She came with all the things. If they ever make this book a movie it “BETTER BE JUST LIKE THE BOOK” do not leave a single thing out. The ending of this book had my mouth on the floor for about five minutes. I was like I know good and well you do not end this book like that. I was shaking! Like I did not see that ending at all.
Verity is about an author named Lowen who was hired to step in and help finish writing Verity’s Murderous book series after she was in a bad accident and is unable to finish off her series.

I honestly really enjoyed it. I was immediately drawn in and had to see what would happen next to Lo. I loved trying to guess what was really going on (I was somewhat right).
That ending though…I loved that it left me wondering and being able to talk to other about their thoughts and opinions.

Out of all that I've read so far, this one by Collen had more sexual content than any of the others that I've read. She did not hold back in her descriptions. It was a thriller with twist and turns, some of which I expected and some not. But I could not put it down. I love the way she describes life as a writer.

20,Books,Verity,$12.99,4,"Verity opens with author Lowen Ashleigh having a very bad morning. Her mother died the previous week after a year-long battle with colon cancer. Lowen had a difficult relationship with her mother -- ""a direct result of my own mother being terrified of me,"" she relates -- but still brought her to Lowen's apartment and cared for her during the last nine months of her life. Lowen is a sleepwalker and her mother kept her fairly secluded as a child, afraid of what Lowen might be capable of doing during one of many sleepwalking episodes. Now she has left her apartment in New York City for the first time in weeks, summoned to a meeting at her publisher's office by her literary agent, Corey, with whom she was previously in an intimate relationship. Just as Lowen is waiting for a crosswalk light to change, a man steps into the street and is struck by a truck. Lowen is understandably shaken, and the man's blood is splattered on her face and white shirt.

A handsome stranger escorts her into a coffee shop bathroom and literally gives her the shirt off his back. They chat briefly, and Loewn concludes that he ""wants to be invisible in this city. Just like me."" After all, she moved to New York to become part of the city's invisible millions of invisible residents. Her books have not sold well enough for her publisher to offer her another contract unless she agrees to promote them, something she has refused to do in the past. ""I'm so awkward I'm afraid once my readers meet me in person, they'll swear off my books forever,"" Lowen laments. ""That's why I stay home and write. I think the idea of me is better than the reality of me."" But another contract was her last hope. She took time off from her writing career believing that her mother would leave her some money. Now, having lived off the advance she received after signing her prior contract, she has learned that she will receive nothing from her mother's estate. And be homeless soon, unless she receives a job offer.

When Lowen arrives at her publisher's office, she is shocked to find the man whose shirt she is wearing is attending the same meeting. He is Jeremy Crawford, husband of Verity, a very successful author who is unable to complete the series of books she was writing. Lowen is being offered a flat fee of seventy-five thousand dollars per book to write the last three volumes in the series, with the first installment due in six months. Lowen is determined to turn down the offer until Jeremy informs her that he selected her because Verity read one of Lowen's books and it was among her favorites. She purportedly told Jeremy that they shared a similar writing style and Lowen was destined to be ""the next big thing."" Verity has been catastrophically injured in a motor vehicle accident, following the deaths of both of her daughters, Chastin and Harper, leaving Jeremy to raise their young son, Crew, alone. Lowen ultimately agrees to take on the project.

Lowen makes the six-hour drive to the Crawford home in Vermont, listening to the audio version of the first book in the series en route. She is to spend time in Verity's office, reviewing the research and notes she left there in order to assess how best to approach writing the next book. Lowen meets Crew and learns that Verity's condition is extremely serious. She is in a virtually catatonic state -- uncommunicative and unable to care for herself. Caregivers spend the day in the home, with Jeremy managing at night. Lowen soon discovers that Verity's office lacks organization -- her expansive desk is strewn with stacks from end to end with papers and files, and boxes containing more documents line the walls. Clearly, the process of sorting through it all will take much longer than Lowen originally anticipated. As she begins reading Verity's second book, she realizes the ""books are from the villain's point of view"" and she will need ""time to work myself into that mindset while writing."" Jeremy claims that he has never read Verity's books because he ""didn't like being inside her head.""

Author Colleen Hoover recounts Lowen's story via a first-person narrative, with the story really taking off as Lowen attempts to settles into the Crawford home. She is keenly observant and inquisitive about Verity's writing, as well as her family, and quickly finds herself attracted to Jeremy, who is still married to the incapacitated woman being cared for in an upstairs bedroom. Searching through Verity's office, Lowen stumbles upon a manuscript entitled ""So Be It."" Verity hopes it is an outline for the next book, but it is instead an autobiography drafted by Verity. Reading it is not what she has been hired to do, but she justifies her insatiable curiosity by construing her review of the manuscript as research. ""I need to see how Verity's mind works to understand her as a writer."" Soon she is absorbed in Verity's descriptions of meeting Jeremy, the development of their relationship and the early days of their marriage, as well as her pregnancies and motherhood. The more she reads, the more frightened of Verity Lowen becomes, especially when events she observes appear to be inconsistent with what she has been told about Verity's condition. Nonetheless, Lowen continues returning to the manuscript to better understand the Crawford family's history, and gain insight into Jeremy and Verity's marriage. But Lowen is playing a dangerous game. Verity's purported autobiography is a dark and disturbing confession of Verity's feelings, motivations, and unspeakably vile acts. Lowen believes the manuscript to be an accurate depiction of Verity's life, and concludes that it ""was written by a very disturbed woman -- a woman whose house I currently inhabit.""

Hoover ramps up the tension as Lowen becomes entangled in a budding relationship with Jeremy, influenced heavily by what she is reading in the manuscript. Verity's revelations are horrifying, and as Lowen and Jeremy grow closer, he increasingly opens up to her, sharing details of his life with Verity about which Lowen feigns ignorance. Lowen's suspicions about the accident in which Verity was injured grow. Is Jeremy being completely honest with Lowen? Why is he willing to embark on a new relationship with Lowen when his wife, although injured, is still alive? He claims that he cannot move Verity to a care facility because Crew cannot sustain another loss. While Verity is cared for in their home, Crew can spend unlimited amounts of time at her bedside. Lowen now possesses detailed information about the deaths of Jeremy's daughters. Were their deaths really tragic accidents? Is Crew safe?

Hoover's characters are both fascinating and infuriating. The story is related solely from Lowen's perspective. Her childhood was difficult because of her sleepwalking and the way it detrimentally impacted her relationship with her mother. She has achieved modest success as a writer, but because of her discomfort in social situations, her career growth has been stymied. She accepts the offer to write Verity's next three books because she desperately needs the money, but also because it is an opportunity too good to pass up. But she is confused not only by her burgeoning attraction to Jeremy, but the incongruity between what she has been told about Verity's accident and what transpires in the house. Of course, Lowen's feelings and experiences are colored by the information set forth in the manuscript. Interestingly, Hoover has said that even when she depicts Lowen reading Verity's manuscript, readers are ""still not fully in Verity’s head because we’re always in Lowen’s perspective, reading something she found. When I write a book from one character’s point of view, I rarely think about the story from the other character’s perspectives. Sometimes it’s necessary for certain scenes, but with this book, it was important for me to feel the confusion and fear Lowen felt. So as the author, I had to be completely blind to what was happening from everyone else's perspectives."" Still, as the story progresses, Hoover keeps readers guessing as to how gullible and vulnerable Lowen really is. She believes the manuscript is truthful and accurate, and that Jeremy is not the villain -- if, in fact there is a villain in the Crawfords' story. But could Lowen possibly be opportunistic, calculating, and willing to do anything to be with Jeremy?

Jeremy is equally captivating. He is handsome, charming, successful, and by all outward appearances, a family man who has sustained unimaginable losses who has been able to soldier on only because he has a young son to raise. To be fair, although Verity's prognosis is never affirmatively established, his desire to move on with his life is understandable -- Verity sustained a serious head injury which will, in all likelihood, preclude her from resuming a fully normal life. But was his meeting with Lowen on the street just before the meeting at her publisher's office really just coincidental? Did he intend for her to find the manuscript in Verity's office? Has he been fully aware of its contents all along? About that, Hoover says, ""I’m not sure because I was never in Jeremy’s head."" In other words, readers can draw their own conclusions, based on the evidence Hoover does present.

And what about Verity? Is she selfishly conniving and evil, as the manuscript suggests? Or is she a blameless grieving mother who was tragically injured in a horrific car accident?

The manuscript provides myriad complications. Lowen debates whether she should discuss it with Jeremy. She doesn't believe he is aware of its existence or content. He claimed he never read Verity's books, after all. Lowen learns that Verity was injured when her vehicle hit a tree, but there were no skidmarks on the pavement. She concludes Verity ""either fell asleep or she did it on purpose."" Does it matter to Lowen which scenario is accurate? What conclusion has Jeremy drawn about the cause of the accident?

Putting aside the perspective from which the story is told, no aspect of the story or the characters can be accepted at face value. Hoover includes plot twists so shocking and unnerving that Verity, originally published in 2018, continues to be one of the most-discussed psychological thrillers ever written. (There is even a Facebook discussion group devoted to the book, boasting nearly twenty-five thousand members!) The book is fast-paced, engrossing, and extremely entertaining. The story's pace gradually accelerates with each surprising development and breath-taking revelations of the truth or, perhaps, a manipulated version of the truth. The tale careens to a jaw-dropping conclusion that will keep readers thinking, discussing, and debating Hoover's extremely clever and nuanced tale, as well as her deliciously intriguing and morally ambiguous characters (who may prove themselves to be not as ambiguous as originally thought) for a very, very long time. Hoover says she ""chose the ending because it’s frightening to me. It’s my biggest nightmare For the darkness in the worlds I create as a writer to somehow"" intrude into her real life.

25,Books,Verity,$12.99,5,"I’ve always held off on reading Colleen Hoover’s books. One of the first things I’ve always heard about her books is how they broke someone’s heart while reading and they were never the same afterwards. That sounded slightly terrifying, so I just held off on reading them.
Well I’ve finally given in and I read Verity….WHAT A MIND EF THAT WAS.
I honestly really enjoyed it. I was immediately drawn in and had to see what would happen next to Lo. I loved trying to guess what was really going on (I was somewhat right).
That ending though…I loved that it left me wondering and being able to talk to other about their thoughts and opinions.
While I’m not quite ready to dive into Colleen’s emotional romances, I’m officially a fan and I can’t wait to check out some more books from her in the future!!",positive

You should hate me for telling you to read it. You should read it in print so you can throw it at the wall without breaking your phone. I'm angry. I'm devastated. I'm in awe of Hoover's talent.

27,Books,Verity,$12.99,5,"After reading some reviews, I almost didn't read Verity. But after some friends told me that I should read it, I decided to order it. There were some parts that bothered me. The suggested violence toward the children made me cry. But it still was a very good book. I don't agree with alot of the negative reviews. But that's ok because we are all different people.
Out of all that I've read so far, this one by Collen had more sexual content than any of the others that I've read. She did not hold back in her descriptions. It was a thriller with twist and turns, some of which I expected and some not. But I could not put it down. I love the way she describes life as a writer. I love that you don't expect the same technique of writing with each of her books because they all are different. There was one part that I absolutely didn't like and wish she would have written differently but it doesn't make me hate the book. I didn't love the ending, yet it was a big part of the whole story. I think the letter was just part of her manipulation. You'll see what I mean after you read it. :-)

Holy bananas Colleen Hoover just demolished me. Completely and 100% blew me away…not that I’m surprised or anything because she never ceases to amaze me but…OMG! Let the book hangover commence because this one is going to be a doozy to recover from. I was pulled in from the beginning and giving the angsty ride of my life...and I loved every second of it!

Elizabeth Tate Collins...where do I begin with Tate. I freakin adored her...I couldn’t help myself. I can’t even tell you the exact moment when it happened or what pushed me over the edge…she took me by storm. Tate really is a force to be reckoned with. She’s so freaking smart…already a nurse at the age of 23 and pursuing her master’s degree in nursing…she’s driven, focused and determined…genuine, kind and caring…but she’s not a pushover. I loved her sense of humor…she’s sweet, funny and sassy. She’s got her own little quirks but I just found them more adorable. I liked her attitude and I think, as usual, the key for me was that I was totally emotional connected to her. Everything she felt…I felt. I related to her in some ways, but that wasn’t even the half of what drew me to her. Tate is a very compelling heroine…she’s just one of these extremely relatable girls that is easy to fall in love with…and it’s easy to see why Miles did as well..

‘Something strange is going on in my chest. A flutter, flutter kind of thing. I hate it, because I know what it means. It means my body is really starting to like Miles.
I just hope my brain never catches up.'

Miles Mikel Archer...oh Jesus Lord in heaven this boy, where do I even begin. He stole my heart…held my heart...he crushed my heart...and then he healed my heart. As closed off and emotionally detached as Miles was, I was still incredibly drawn to him...and that's saying something considering I am an emotional reader. I think it's because the glimpses of emotion that we get in the beginning from him are like moments of gold...I clung to those because they were just...so amazing! Knowing how much those affected me...how could I not want more?!? I swear…the moment he stroked Tate’s foot and cracked a smile I was DONE FOR people. Just done. I know…I sound crazy, but that boy melted my heart and he continued to do so for the remaining 80% of the book. Oh Miles…Miles Miles Miles…every time I thought I had no more feels left to give…he painfully extracted them from my body…every time I thought he cannot be more perfect (yes…even with his walls!)…he proved me wrong with his words and actions. Miles is very understated...he’s sexy but it’s not shoved in your face and he doesn’t act like a conceited @#% hat. He’s successful but he doesn’t brag about it or let it go to his head. He’s sweet, kind and thoughtful…but its like he doesn’t want anyone to know. But Tate knows…

‘I’ve always been a sucker for the quiet types of guys. Primarily because most guys talk too much, and it’s painful having to suffer through every single thought that goes through their heads. Miles makes me wish he were the opposite of the quiet type, though. I want to know all the thoughts that pass through his head. Especially the one thought that’s in there right now, hiding behind that unwavering, stoic expression.’

Hmm...how do I describe Miles and Tate...hot...sensual...electric...passionate...just YES! How can it not be? Their relationship is based of one thing...sex. Now…before we get crazy, it’s not erotica, it’s tasteful but it’s still sexy as hell. Heck…everything about Miles and Tate was sexy and addictive…I truly could not get enough of them. I thrived off of Miles and Tate together...they are just that amazing. You could see even in the littlest things how happy and complete he made her and as much as he tried to fight it, I could tell she was chipping away at that hardened shell. It was hard though…seeing the impact of his decisions and what that did to Tate…it hurt my heart, but…I never once questioned her decisions. I was waiting for that point when I would get frustrated or angry with what Tate was doing…it didn’t come. I got it…because I understood her feelings for him…I would have done the same thing! Truly, the thought of her walking away from him killed me more than the angst they were experiencing.

‘He brings his hands up and slides them through my hair, brushing his thumbs across my cheeks. He inhales a shaky breath while looking down at my mouth. “You make it so hard to breathe.”
He punctuates his sentence with his kiss, bringing his lips over mine. Every remaining part of me that had yet to melt in his presence is now liquefied like the rest of me. I try to recall a time when a man’s mouth felt this good against mine. His tongue slides across my lips, then dips inside, tasting me, filling me, claiming me.
Oh….my.
I.
Love.
His.
Mouth.’

Tate and Miles are so…unique. I loved that we got both of their POV’s…I love the way both of their POV’s are presented…and I’m being intentionally vague on that because I don’t want to spoil things because that was part of the surprise for me. I wasn’t expecting to get both but it was honestly genius and a totally different approach. I guess…the best way for me to describe without giving too much away is that I fell in love with Miles twice…which is probably why he got to me so deeply. You get to see two very different sides to him, both of them are amazing and wonderful (hence…the falling in love) but that’s where my struggle began. Now…before I go on, we’ve established, I love Miles…I love everything I know about him and every second I learned more I fell more…I love the good, the bad and the ugly…I felt like a part of my heart broke with him…I shed tears for him…flaws and all he is still perfect in my eyes. So…here’s the problem…I was so connected with Tate and feeling her pain…so I was getting double duty pain…with her and for him…it sometimes felt like I was being ripped in two. The struggle is real…

‘A kiss is so much easier than what we’re doing. When you kiss, you can close your eyes. You can kiss away the thoughts. You can kiss away the pain, the doubt, the shame. When you close your eyes and kiss, you protect yourself from the vulnerability.
This isn’t us protecting ourselves.
This is confrontation. This is a standoff. This is eye-to-eye combat. This is a dare, from me to Miles, from Miles to me. I dare you to try to stop this, we’re both silently screaming.’

I could babble on and on all day about these two…but that’s not all there is. There are two other very important men in Tate’s life and I thoroughly enjoyed the relationships she had with them. First…her brother Corbin…he is the typical older brother, super protective, loving to a fault and no one is good enough for his little sister. I liked their closeness…at a time when Tate needed someone, he was there for her in his own way and they had a very easy relationship…except when it comes to Tate’s dating life, but I thought it was cute that he was so caring and wanted what was best for her. In all honesty…if it wasn’t for Corbin…there would be no Tate and Miles…so it’s really all his fault. Then we have Cap….his real name is Samuel but it just looks weird calling him that cause…well, he’s Cap. He’s an 80 year old man that turned into one of Tate’s closest friends and I don’t think I could have loved their relationship more if I wanted to. He was this little injection of comedic relief, his timing was perfect and there is no other word for Cap besides awesome.

‘“What do you think would make a man never want to experience love again?”
Cap doesn’t answer my question for at least five floors. I eventually look at him, and he’s looking right at me, his eyes narrowed, producing even more wrinkles between them. “I suppose if a man lived through the ugliest side of love, he might never want to experience it again.”
I contemplated his answer, but it doesn’t help much. I don’t see how love could get ugly enough for a person to just shut himself off from it completely.’

Of course the writing is absolutely flawless…it’s Colleen Hoover, there was never any doubt in my mind. I’m in awe of her. I literally don’t feel like I’m reading when I read her books…it’s an experience…I live it with the characters. I immerse myself in her stories and I think it’s genuinely impossible not to walk away from them a changed human. Every sentence blends perfectly…the flow is smooth…I’m just effortlessly pulled in. It’s torture to stop reading and you never want the journey to end. I liked that this book was a little different from some of her others…but it still had that CoHo vibe to it – her tone is still there, the characters still have that special edge that make them classically hers, but it was just a little more mature. Seriously, the one common thing with all of her books is the level of emotion that she pours into them…especially this one. Every time I think there is no way she can out do it…can make me cry again…can angst my heart out more…can create characters that I can love to bits and pieces…and yet she does. Every. Single. Time. It’s brilliant wrapped in genius dipped in amazing…shot straight through my brain and into my heart.

‘She’s absolutely beautiful. Her hope is beautiful. The smile on her face is beautiful. The tears streaming down her cheeks are beautiful.
Her
love
is
beautiful.’

I am a self professed clinger…and I’m struggling to let go of Miles and Tate but…I can’t deny…Ugly Love is a perfect standalone. Do I think Corbin deserves a book? Your darn tootin’…that boy is a man whore and I LOVE my man whores…he is a recipe for awesome in the making when combined with Colleen’s brain…but that still doesn’t change that I couldn’t have asked for anything better than the way Miles and Tate’s story ended. It was perfection…big red bow and all. I laughed…I cried…I loved…it was beautiful and ugly and everything I wanted and I will never look at water the same way again.",positive
31,Books,Ugly Love: A Novel,$10.40,5,"“If I were capable of loving someone… it would be you.”

Colleen Hoover is a genius, plain and simple. I’ve read Slammed/Point of Retreat/This Girl and Maybe Someday/Maybe Not and I’ve loved them all, but after reading Ugly Love I can easily say that this was my favorite CoHo book that I’ve read so far! This woman has such a way with words, her writing is just a joy to read, even when she’s tearing your heart out. I don’t know how she does it, she doesn’t use big fancy words or complicated prose, these are just ordinary everyday words but the way she puts them all together is simply magical. It’s hard for me to describe, but if you’ve read any CoHo books I think you know what I’m talking about. All of her stories are so unique and amazing but one thing they all have in common is Colleen Hoover’s gift with words. I know exactly what I’ll be getting when I pick up one of her books in terms of writing and quality, but I am always surprised with the direction her stories take. It’s always an incredible adventure and I love going along for the ride.

I loved how this book was narrated, it’s told from dual POVs, alternating every other chapter between Tate and Miles. The thing that made this book unique is that Tate’s chapters were set in the present day and (with the exception of the last few chapters) all of Miles’ chapters were set 6 years earlier. So we essentially get two separate love stories that are both wonderful and beautiful that come back together in such a great way. I loved getting Miles’ backstory in the form of these flashback chapters, first off they were so amazingly written, they just flowed like poetry and I found myself lost in these simple words:

‘My new favorite flavor is Rachel. My new favorite thing is Rachel. I want Rachel for my birthday. I want Rachel for Christmas. I want Rachel for graduation. Rachel, Rachel, Rachel. I’m gonna fall in love with you anyway, Rachel.’

Secondly, in Tate’s chapters Miles really is an enigma and without his current day POV you really don’t have much clue what’s going on behind that wall he’s put up:

‘Still no smile, though. Jesus Christ, this man. Does he now realize that facial expressions are supposed to accompany speech?’

But reading his flashback chapters really helped understand what Miles’ potential to love was. Before you find out what happened to him in the past that caused him to be so closed off you get to see what a huge heart he has and his great capacity for love. This book was just as much Miles and Rachel’s love story as it was Miles and Tate’s story, you’d think that as a reader you’d have ill feelings towards the “other woman” because you know you should be rooting for Tate but there’s none of that. I felt Miles and Rachel’s story just as fully as I did him and Tate.

Colleen Hoover’s characters are always so well written, they are well developed, incredibly detailed and 100% relatable. I totally loved Tate, she was a riot and she said and did things that I could see myself doing in those situations and I connected with her right away. I loved her inner musings as she tried to figure Miles out or tried to soak up any little scrap of hope he threw her way:

‘“You look pretty, Tate.” I want to plaster those four words on a billboard and require myself to pass it on my drive to work every day. I would never take another day off work again.’

There were some times when Miles would do something where Tate totally should have walked away, but I think she reacted how many women would react and I know that she didn’t give up completely on Miles because she knew what was happening between them was real even though he would never admit it. Miles intrigued me from the start and from their first meeting where she witnessed his very private breakdown I knew that I was in for a doozy when his past was revealed. I knew he must have endured some horrible event(s) that caused him to swear off any form of love, and wow was he dedicated to his rules:

“Don’t ask about my past,” he says firmly. “And never expect a future.”

I’ve never seen a character hold so steadfastly to rules like he did. We got to see moments, tiny glimpses of actions or a slipped word that gave us some hope but just as quickly as we grasped that hope he snatched it right back. I was so sad for him and falling so in love with him at the same time (much like Tate, only with the added bonus of seeing what a wonderful guy he was six years earlier when he was still full of life and love) and I just wanted to hug him. My heart completely broke for him as his full past is finally revealed, and I will say that what actually happened was not at all what I was expecting. But I love how once we hit that point the story shifts to all present day and it’s seamless and I love how it put my heart back together again and wrapped up in a totally believable and satisfying way.

In addition to Tate and Miles I loved all of the secondary characters. I’ve already mentioned Rachel and I did really love her. I also loved Corbin and his friendship with Miles and his protectiveness of his sister. I also liked seeing Ian and Miles’ relationship both in the past and in the present day. My favorite secondary character however was Cap, I LOVED Cap! I love how Colleen Hoover can throw in a quirky random character like this and make you totally fall in love with them and have them end up being so important to the overall story.

I read this book over the course of a few hours spread out the day, I simply could not put it down. I struggled though because I wanted to read as fast as I possibly could to find out what happens next but at the same time I wanted to slow down to savor every single word on the page! In the end speed won out but I think I highlighted half the book with passages I wanted to always remember! I’m going to have to re-read this book someday because I don’t think one time is enough for something written as well as this was. I’m sad I don’t have more time with Miles and Tate but I am so glad that I was able to spend one wonderful afternoon/evening in their world with them and I know I will never forget this amazing, beautiful, ugly love story! 5+++ stars!

32,Books,Ugly Love: A Novel,$10.40,5,"This book captivated the generational love we experience now in 2022. People who are confused about love , whether to face it or to run from it. I felt she captured such a topic for something that was published in 2014. Tate had a beautiful character development where a girl lost in San Francisco became adapted and fell in love with a Pilot who was so afraid of love that only an arrangement of sex was his way of keeping Tate close to her . I finished this book within a day and felt the rollercoaster of emotion as if I was Tate . The way the book ended made my heart smile in ways because a part of me always wanted miles to face his skeleton in his closet from the minute their arrangement was made and he did which ended in a beautiful happy ever after.",positive
33,Books,Ugly Love: A Novel,$10.40,5,"What kind of love gets ugly? The kind Hoover writes about, that's what kind! And boy does she know how to write it because there was not one second during this book that I didn't have my heart bleeding in a table somewhere. Bleeding, you say, this can't be good, right? Oh, but it is so right because Hoover knows how to gut you, draw and quarter you, and then slowly sew you back together again. I know going into a Hoover book that it won't be pretty, but I do it anyway because in the end, she makes the story well worth the ride.

Blurb from Goodreads:
Never ask about the past.
Don’t expect a future.
When Tate Collins meets airline pilot Miles Archer, she knows it isn’t love at first sight. They wouldn’t even go so far as to consider themselves friends. The only thing Tate and Miles have in common is an undeniable mutual attraction. Once their desires are out in the open, they realize they have the perfect set-up. He doesn’t want love, she doesn’t have time for love, so that just leaves the sex. Their arrangement could be surprisingly seamless, as long as Tate can stick to the only two rules Miles has for her. They think they can handle it, but realize almost immediately they can’t handle it at all.
Hearts get infiltrated.
Promises get broken.
Rules get shattered.
Love gets ugly

Imagine a tragedy so terrible it makes you never want to put yourself out there for love again. Now imagine having someone enter your life that you try your hardest not to love because there is no way on this earth you could ever love again. Now scramble your brain. Yup, that's pretty much this book.

Tate moves to San Fransisco to live with her brother and go to school. What she doesn't expect is to be attracted to her brother's very hot, very closed off, and totally not willing to love next door neighbor. But who is capable of ignoring matters of the heart? I loved this character. She is starts off as a strong and very well rounded. She knows what she wants, and does what she needs to have at least a little part of it. And, like many NA characters, she can't ignore what her heart feels. I found her very relatable and realistic. Does she have weaknesses, she sure does. Her weakness is not being able to stay away from someone who she feels such a great connection to she just knows there must be a way to break through. But you can't change someone unless they want to change, right? One thing that bothers me about Tate is that she does show more weakness during the book than I would have liked. Yet, I understood the need for her to have this weakness. And as much as I wanted to chastise her for it. one cannot go lightly into such deep affairs of the heart and not show weakness at some point.

Enter Miles. Sexy, swoon worthy, pilot Miles Archer has a lifetime of tragedy behind him at only 24 years old. And he won't open his heart to anyone. He's a mystery that Tate can't figure out, as much as she wants to. But Miles has his rules: he won't talk about the past and he has no intention of creating any kind of future. He's straight forward and to the point about it. At first, this made me mad at him. Had it not been for his chapters, I'm pretty sure I would have thrown this book up against the wall a number of times with the anger he caused me. But it isn't that Miles in incapable of love, it's that he doesn't want his heart to get hurt. He's closed and unpredictable, and his mystery was something I wanted to crack wide open. He reminded me a bit of Christian Grey. I know I know, don't punch me, why on earth would I ever compare Hoover to James? Well, I'm not, I'm just saying that some of the qualities you see in Christian are there with Miles. But in the end, his reasons for being who he is are sad and powerful. Miles was one of the most heartbreaking characters I have ever had the chance to get to know.

Hoover has this way of flaying you open, making your heart bleed out all over the place until you have almost nothing left to give. And then, in one foul swoop, she redeems herself and sews you back together, little piece by agonizing piece. Her words are powerful. She writes like a musician, creating lyrics that drag you along, even if you feel like you don't want to go. Her words are a powerful tool and weapon against her readers for sure. And with each book she writes, she gets better and better at showing us how broken people can really be. But she also shows us how they are capable of mending and healing and becoming whole again.

This book is definitely a bit more racey then her past stuff. Darker and different than what you have seen from her in the past. While most of Hoovers books have focused on the story behind the plot, this one really jumps into the sexy. But the sexy is the whole point of this story. Because without the sexy, there would be no connection formed with Tate and Miles. And then their story would have gone nowhere at all. Friends with benefits takes on a whole new meaning when you watch Tate and Miles together. Their attraction is undeniable, but there is so much more underneath, so much more depth to their experiences together. And that just makes the book that much more engrossing.

There is one word I use whenever I describe Hoover's books. One word that always ends up in my status updates on Goodreads. Because there is only one word that can show exactly how Hoover's books make me feel. And that word is INTENSE. The intensity of her writing, her plot lines, the connections between her characters cause a physical ache in my heart. I'm not much of a crier when it comes to reading, but Hoover always seems to be able to pull the tears from me.

Tough Critic Book Reviews summed this book up perfectly, so I will quote her: ""This is definitely a story about loss, but more importantly an excruciatingly painful story about love"" And excruciatingly painful it is. This is a nonstop, un-put-downable book that will leave your heart aching in ways you never thought possible. Just when I think Hoover can't make a story any better than she has in the past, she surpasses what she did before. I don't know how she does it, but I don't care. All I know is that I cannot wait to see what she gives us next.",positive

35,Books,Ugly Love: A Novel,$10.40,4,"This is the first book I have read by Colleen Hoover and I enjoyed every second of it. I am always receiving recommendations from book tok, bookstagram, or book YouTube accounts. Collen Hoover is always recommended and that is the reason I went on to buying multiple books of hers. I decided to start with Ugly Love to be officially introduced to her.

I loved Miles and Tate. I knew he endured grief in the past without it even being talked about at the beginning. I enjoyed seeing his and Tates relationship develop. Personally me I don't believe you can make someone fall in love with you. That is what Tate was doing from the beginning because she liked Miles head on at the beginning regardless of when they set there rules as.

But, I was happy to see him start to open up. However, I hated how he treated Tate at times because he would lead her on and then switch up. I do like that the both of then had ambition as well within there careers which reminds me of myself 🤩.

I can say I wasn't fond of the way Miles chapters were written. It was a poem to a certain extent and I understand what Collen was doing I just wasn't that big on the structure. It was amazing to see his background and what broke him. Not to mention to see a hero in the book let out his emotions was astonishing because men are always taught to be strong and hold everything in. Miles did it, but was finally able to let it go. That is why I was happy for him at the end to find love with Tate and become a father for the second time.

I give the book a 4.5/5 for reasons known. It was great chemistry between the charaters, a good plot, and represented grief well. But, I had issues with the pace of the book and at times the relationship forming between Miles and Tate. That was really about it.

I recommended anybody to read this book! It was great and I look forward to now reading other books by Colleen 🤗.",positive

First of all, the way that @colleenhoover illustrated Miles's happiness through the literal layout of the words on the pages was so remarkable and unique. It made the end that much more fulfilling (spoiler? but is it?)

Based on the description of the book, I went into this thinking it was going to be a spicy, light-hearted, friends-to-lovers type of romance. I did not expect the level of depth and heartache.

Tate's experience prioritizing time spent with Miles over her own desires and boundaries was so relatable - I wish I would have read this in my early 20s. There were slight hints of Lily from It Ends With Us, but not at all as dark or heavy. Miles - man. I definitely crushed on Miles. Well done, CoHo, well done.",positive
38,Books,Ugly Love: A Novel,$10.40,5,"Damn this story was so emotional. I felt SO many things while reading this. There were things I loved but also things I didn’t like about this book. One thing for certain was that I couldn’t put it down and now that I’ve finished this, I’m really attached to this couple lol. I feel like I’ve been through the wringer with them.

I loved Tate so much, but for so much of this book I wanted her to find someone who would love and cherish her the way she deserved. The chemistry between her and Miles and the intensity of their relationship was brilliantly written. But the way he kept breaking her heart made me want her to find someone else so badly. But I was riveted by the dynamic between these two-so much that I could not stop reading.

The thing I did not like so much about this book was the amount of time dedicated to Mile’s backstory and describing his love and infatuation for his “first love” Rachel. I know this part of his history is important to the story, but I felt it was just too much. Every other chapter (although these chapters were brief) was about how deeply he was in love with Rachel -almost to the point of obsession. This all leads to a horrific tragedy which tears him and Rachel apart. This is what brings him to his present situation of not being able to love again. And poor Tate bears the brunt of this.

The way it all plays out was gut wrenching and heartbreaking. The ending and conclusion was fantastically done. I don’t think I could have asked for a better ending.",positive

Five years ago, Kenna made a devastating mistake that led to the death of the man she loved. Now out of prison, she is returning to the town in which the tragedy occurred, hoping to start a relationship with her four-year-old daughter, Diem. But she knows it won't be easy and, in fact, it seems everyone in her daughter's life is determined to shut her out even though she is doing everything she can to prove herself and absolve of her sins.

Though unlikely, Kenna finds support in the form of Ledger Ward, a local bar owner and someone with a big connection to her daughter. Though he should hate her, and does at first, as he gets to know Kenna, Ledger sees beyond her mistakes to the kind, loving, smart, strong woman she is. A woman who has held her own share of unimaginable grief and loss and just wants the chance to know her daughter. And though it puts him in a terrible position, he cannot help but develop feelings for her.

Despite the impossible circumstances, Ledger and Kenna form a bond that defies logic and they know they will have insurmountable odds to beat if they are to be together and if Kenna is going to be allowed to be a mother to her daughter.

I am not sure what more I can say about this book aside from the fact that it was utterly beautiful. Harrowing, raw, emotional, it tugged at my heartstrings

It is no secret that I am rarely disappointed in anything Colleen Hoover writes. I find that she is a master of writing nuanced characters that have deeply complex relationship dynamics and often times, immense flaws that only had to their complexity. Reminders of Him was no different.

Told from the perspectives of both Kenna and Ledger, you follow each on intensely emotional journeys separately, as well as together.

For Kenna, it is a journey of redemption. Absolution. The journey of a mother who just wanted to see her daughter and who will do whatever she has to to make that happen. It is about proving her worth, atoning for her sins, and showing that she is not a bad person. She is just a person who made a really bad mistake.

For Ledger, his journey is one of forgiveness. Of doing what is right. Overcoming years of hatred to see beyond the loss he suffered to the heart of the person who caused it. Realizing that the love and relationship he has developed with Kenna's daughter is only one that can be enriched and benefitted by Kenna's presence, not harmed by it. But he is put in an awful position as being with Kenna, fighting for her, means betraying the people raising Diem. The ones most affected by Kenna's mistake.

Though this is a relatively brief novel, it packs a severe punch. One that his agonizing and heart-wrenching as you route for Kenna, but cannot help but be appalled by her past. As you are frustrated with Ledger, but also understand his actions and his reasonings. There is so much depth here and it was so well done.",positive
41,Books,Reminders of Him: A Novel,$9.57,5,"People have been raving about Colleen Hoover's books for several years, but I still hadn't read any. I finally picked up It Ends With Us and now Reminders of Him. She is definitely deserving of the praise and I will be picking through her backlist. In this book we meet Kenna Rowan, a young woman who made some awful mistakes and paid a terrible price. She has a four year old daughter that she has never seen, and is being raised by her paternal grandparents, as her father is dead. They do not want Kenna anywhere near Diem, but she just wants to see her, to meet her, not take her from her grandparents. When she returns to town, she meets Ledger, the best friend of Kenna's deceased boyfriend, a man who is very close to his family and an integral part of Diem's life. He is attracted to her, until he finds out who she is. When they begin to develop feelings toward one another, Ledger tries to resist, but he wants to do what is best for both Kenna and Diem.

This story was so emotional, I was glad I had tissues near by. We learn about Kenna's past and the accident that changed her life completely through letters she has written while in prison. She shares her feelings and thoughts that she couldn't tell anyone about. I wanted to reach into the book and hold Kenna close, stroke her hair and wipe her tears. She is a character that gets under your skin and breaks your heart over and over. Ledger was another amazing character. He wanted to do what was right for everyone, even if it caused those he cared about some pain. He looked beyond all he heard about Kenna and saw what was in her heart. The romance was slow to develop, but there were a couple of sex scenes that I could have done without. One thing I have come to learn quickly is that Colleen Hoover writes amazing characters who become real, people you want to know. The story itself is very well written, with well developed characters, an excellent plot and one that I wanted to know what was going to happen, but didn't want to end. I loved the epilogue as it tied up the story nicely, yet was short and sweet. I definitely recommend this book to people who enjoy romance, second chances, family stories, forgiveness and family.

I did a read/listen with this book and both formats were wonderful. Brittany Pressley and Ryan West do a fantastic job narrating this book. The emotions shine through with their performance and when I was listening I was totally immersed in the story. When I had a chance to sit, I read and again, was pulled into this story.

42,Books,Reminders of Him: A Novel,$9.57,5,"This is my second book by Colleen Hoover and I honestly didn't think anything could top the first, It Ends With Us. And while I'm not sure I would say this tops it, it's right there beside it. I haven't read a novel from cover-to-cover in a single day since I was a teenager... until this book.

Reminders of His is classified as romance, and while there is romance within it's pages, that's not the most prominent love story. And this love story completely, utterly gutted me. There were only a handful of pages I read without tears in my eyes.

If you've read anything by Colleen Hoover, you know she's a master with words, and this book was no different. Her writing is absorbing and mesmerizing, and she creates beautifully imperfect characters that you are immediately drawn to and feel like you know yourself. The story itself, however, is truly spectacular. It's raw and human and so real. There are no ""bad guys"" in this one--only people who have loved and lost and are doing the best they can to cope. Any person with feelings is going to have a lasting lump in their throat. And for the mothers out there, it's going to cause you physical pain.

One last note on the story. Colleen has done a exceptional job of humanizing a person we, as a society, love to demonize because of their record. I personally had family members who were in prison and can attest to the accuracy with which the author portrays the difficulties and challenges faced when inmates are released back to the streets. This struggles this main character faces just because of having been to prison are real. The story provides an urging to society to remember that people are human and make mistakes and many do not deserve to be demonized as a result; a mistake doesn't make someone a bad person.",positive
43,Books,Reminders of Him: A Novel,$9.57,5,"Wow! Just wow. I wasn’t sure how to write this review or where to start this review. This book was so much and its hard to put it all into words.

I finished this book in a day and a half. I just couldn’t put it down, I just had to know what was going to happen.

This is one of the saddest book I've read. Kenna's story just broke me heart. This book really made me cry.

Kenna made one mistake and it has impacted her whole life, and let be honest even before her mistake she didn’t have the best life.

She was finally able to have a moment of happiness and its ripped away from her in the harshest of ways possible.

I couldn’t believe how unfair her life has been and I just wanted her to get a win just one.

Ledger was a bit of a jerk in the beginning which was understandable given the situation.

But he was a caring and considerate to the people he cares about and extremely protective.

“I don’t like that the one person I dislike the most in this world reminds me of the person I love the most.”

After some time he realizes that maybe he didn’t know the whole story and he was led to believe something that wasn’t true. And maliciously but because that was what it seemed like.

Ledger starts to see a side of Kenna that he didn’t realize existed and he sees the sadness in her, even though he doesn’t want to he finds himself being protective of her.

Kenna does everything she can to try to redeem herself, but it seems like its always out of her reach.

Everyone judges her and doesn’t know a thing about what she's been through the hurt, the pain, the utter despair and the depression she felt. It just broke my heart.

“So, you decide right now, right here. Are you gonna live in your sadness or are you gonna die in it?”

Colleen Hoover really took me on a rollercoaster ride in this book. You feel the hurt of all the character and their pain.

“Please don’t,” I whisper. “It hurts enough already.”

What was really amazing too was while we were in the present in the story we got to understand the past and the relationship between Scotty and Kenna. And how much they felt for each other.

This was beautifully written I literally could put the book down all day I just had to know how things would end for Kenna, Ledger and the rest of the characters.

“Maybe it doesn’t matter whether something is a coincidence or a sign. Maybe the best way to cope with the loss of the people we love is to find them in as many places and things as we possibly can. And in the off chance that the people we lose are still somehow able to hear us, maybe we should never stop talking to them.”

It takes Kenna a really long time but she does find a way to forgive herself for the mistake she's made. And for her to find some sort of happiness. I enjoyed this part some much and was so happy for her.

“Now that I’ve forgiven myself, the reminders of him only make me smile.”

Ledger and Kenna are so good together, I love that Ms. Hoover took the time to let the characters really get to know each other and it wasn’t rushed. They peeled back every layer and got to the heart of everything. Which bound them together even more.

Colleen Hoover weaves a story of love, loss and forgiveness that will have you crying and wishing that you could give Kenna a hug. I wanted so much for things to go right for her for. And for someone to give her a chance.

This is an amazing story, that will bring all your emotions to the forefront and make you cry.",positive

It is no secret that Colleen Hoover knows how to craft an emotionally intense story that could very well be the life story of any one of us. The myriad of people who have read her books and then posted somewhere on social media that they related so completely with a particular story is endless. I see posts, daily, about how these stories touch their lives. And Reminders of Him is no exception.

I am not saying that countless people can relate to the fact that this young woman spent years in prison because she made one life altering decision one night. I’m saying that countless young woman can relate to Kenna, as a person, as someone who grew up in the same kind of environment she was subjected to. Who felt mostly unseen their entire lives, like they weren’t important or worth anything, until they met a Scotty of their own.

Even though Scotty is gone, he played such an integral role in this story. He was still Kenna’s sounding board every single day. She basically had no one at all in the world, so it was no wonder she still clung to him all these years later as someone she loved, admired, and was devoted to. Even though Ledger’s initial feelings towards her were not positive, he quickly turned into that one physical person Kenna was able to turn to for the same comfort she always got from Scotty.

I’m not going to lie, a large majority of this book felt super heavy to me. Like there was never going to be a way that anything positive was going to happen. It just felt like an insurmountable, no-win situation. Until finally, some rays of sunlight started to peek through. I really have no clue at all how Kenna stayed on her feet every day. I feel like I would have crumbled long ago and never have found a way to rise out of those ashes.

This was a powerful read. It definitely tugs at all the heartstrings. Ledger was otherworldly. Are there really guys out there like him? I’m pretty sure there are, because I married one. I hope every woman out there finds her own Ledger.

My only complaint was that it wrapped up too quickly in the end. I wanted to see so much more interaction between Kenna, Diem and Ledger. But at the same time, Colleen ended it perfectly. Wow, just wow.",positive

Like Kenna and Ledger in this story I am so torn. I can feel every single thing, I found myself crying and not realizing I was crying. I found myself holding my breath, waiting on pins and needles, I found myself shaking my head and my heart filling with so much pain, empathy, and frustration for what they must be going through.

I did not like the main character at all. Seriously, a heroine who I would cast as the villain? Then I figured we would discover it wasn’t true, her evils didn’t happen as we thought. It was another guy, a case of mistaken identity, someone switched out the clues or whatever.

But no, the reader is forced to forgive someone for having done a terrible thing.

I couldn’t! I couldn’t get past the bad and like her enough to root for her. Until I did. Somewhere in there I saw the main character the way the author intended; a good person who made a series of mistakes because she was young and dumb and in love and thought she was invincible, of young and dumb and thought “things couldn’t be worse than this”. Like everyone else was once upon a time.

…which I’m guessing was the whole point. It’s not forgiveness if you find out the person didn’t actually do it, it’s forgiveness when you know they did, and you choose to stop holding it against them.

So in all, I liked it. A star removed because it was a bit too tidy, and I thought some characters could do with a half-page backstory to explain them. But others seem to think characters are all well developed, so that’s probably just me.",positive

I cried for her and her struggles to forgive herself for the tragic accident that took the life of the man she loved, blaming herself and feeling she deserved a much stronger punishment than seven years in prison, that she didn't even try to fight for herself.

You laugh because sometimes in grief the only you can do is laugh or give into the pain.

I really appreciated the spotlight on the bleakness of prison and the inhumanity it often holds. There's an exploration of how hard it is for some to go on after prison. The book is really about the layers to forgiveness and the many ways it makes into your life.

💭”Whoever was the first person to say they fell in love must have already fallen out of it. Otherwise, they’d have called it something much better.”

After serving five years in prison for a tragic mistake, Kenna Rowan returns to the town where it all went wrong, hoping to reunite with her four-year-old daughter. But the bridges Kenna burned are proving impossible to rebuild. Everyone in her daughter’s life is determined to shut Kenna out, no matter how hard she works to prove herself. The only person who hasn’t closed the door on her completely is Ledger Ward, a local bar owner and one of the few remaining links to Kenna’s daughter. But if anyone were to discover how Ledger is slowly becoming an important part of Kenna’s life, both would risk losing the trust of everyone important to them. The two form a connection despite the pressure surrounding them, but as their romance grows, so does the risk. Kenna must find a way to absolve the mistakes of her past in order to build a future out of hope and healing.

50,Books,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.98,5,"What I liked most about this book is the depictions of believably real (though fictional) characters challenged by real-life issues, with the characters' basic motivations well described and integrated into a story of how the characters succeed or fail against their challenges, and why. I believe the philosophical term for literature of this kind is ""metaphysical values.""

(I haven't seen the movie so far but probably will see it eventually. Meanwhile, the various trailers that I've seen seem to indicate that the novel's main spirit may have been badly mangled in the movie, possibly to emphasize issues such as racial prejudice and other forms of bias against those who are ""different,"" and other contemporary concerns. From various critical reviews on this website, it also appears that the story itself may have greatly misrepresented what North Carolina was actually like in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. But I don't see geographical or historical accuracy as necessarily essential to a fictional story concretizing important metaphysical values.)

At the end of the novel, in the Q&A with the author (pp. 376-377), there is a very concise description of what the book is about. The story follows the life of a young girl named ""Kya"" living mostly alone in fictional marshlands in North Carolina from age 6 to her death from natural causes (unexpected heart failure) at age 64. It's a story of how she survives with minimal help from anyone else. A child of 6 wouldn't have been able to survive alone for long without significant knowledge and experience gained from interaction with other humans, and she did receive minimal interaction with her mother, brother, father, brother's friend Tate (later Kya's first lover and eventual husband after a fateful 2nd love with Chase Andrews), and a married (black) couple in the nearby fictional town of Barkley Cove. Tate and Chase both disappoint Kya deeply, Chase so strongly that Kya becomes the prime suspect when Chase is found dead, apparently murdered. (Chase lied to her about potentially marrying her, and he even tried to rape her, causing her to fear that Chase would keep trying again and again by force.) Before Tate leaves her while he goes to college, she learns to read with Tate's help. He also gives her many old books to read, mostly on life science. She apparently never receives access to any books in literature, history, philosophy, or other general humanities subjects. She remains forever shy and defensive toward most other people despite becoming highly adept at studying the wild animals and plants in the marsh, writing books of her own on her observations, becoming successful as a published author, and painting vivid sketches of what she observed. Along the way, she also learns to count beyond 29 and to count money and make change, again with help from Tate and others.

At her trial for the murder of Chase, the prosecution presents serious evidence against her, but the evidence isn't quite strong enough to obtain a guilty verdict from the jury (beyond reasonable doubt). She has an especially good alibi, although it has weaknesses that leave room to doubt her innocence. Since there are also reasonable doubts about her guilt, the jury verdict is ""not guilty."" One key piece of evidence, a ""shell necklace,"" remains missing until the very last page of the story, shortly after Kya's death, when Tate (whom she had married by then) finds it. For those who want to be surprised, I won't say more about the details of the ending. Kya certainly would have had to be incredibly resourceful and daring, perhaps far larger than real life, to have been able to construct such a convincing alibi, if she actually was the murderer. The symbolic parallel to the mating rituals of fireflies provides a strong hint about Kya's mental state.

The events of the story are mainly just the backdrop. The story's main focus is on how Kya felt and how she learned so much about nature and life sciences from her own direct observations and from books that she read, without ever attending school at any level for more than one deeply unpleasant day at age 6. Despite how little she learned about humanities subjects and how to deal with other people, the story depicts her as focused on the reality that she was exposed to, and on how she used her natural intellectual capacity to make sense of it as best she could. She certainly functioned on a reality-is-real premise, though without explicitly identifying that premise or comprehending its higher implications for human living; she also felt her emotions without any explicit appeal to any greater mysticism or other-worldly perspective. (Kya shows no superstitiousness or religious worship of natural phenomena.) But the story doesn't attempt to delve further than that into issues of values, why man needs them, and how best to choose and pursue one's values. With access to books, Kya surely would have had the opportunity to do such deeper reading in real life, even if she remained otherwise isolated from most other people throughout her life. She had Tate, along with the two adult townspeople, her publisher, and to some extent her brother Jodie -- all of whom provided emotional support to her during her trial. She is a heroine of sorts, though a severely stunted and crippled one, especially emotionally toward others.

The author describes the story as ""primarily about self-reliance, survival and how isolation affects human behavior. Since our species is a social mammal, we have strong genetic tendencies to belong to a group of tightly bonded family and friends."" (P. 376.) What ""genetic tendencies"" does this refer to? How much personal choice do humans have? Man has a non-automatic rational faculty on which he needs to depend for his survival. But he also needs a lot of help from others, especially family, along the way as he proceeds from the stage of a newborn infant to adult life. Without such help in childhood, the stunted growth that may hinder a child's development and readiness for adult living should not be surprising. A more heroic kind of story might explore more fully how much more a person can learn about life from books, and how events might unfold as such a person strives to apply such learnings in practice. Kya certainly makes a valiant and largely successful effort, which, for me, makes Crawdads excellent as far as it goes.",positive
51,Books,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.98,5,"I just finished reading (and crying through) the first novel by naturalist Delia Owens entitled, “Where the Crawdads Sing”. She has achieved a literary feat uncommon to naturalists, let alone novelists. 67 weeks at the top? Her readers are not wrong. But first, let’s talk about crawdads…

Do they sing? No. They are tiny freshwater lobsters that live underwater. They only sing, as do Maine, and rock lobsters, when you put them in a pot of boiling water and the steam expands through their exoskeleton. So no, they do not sing, nor do they do anything else that can remotely be depicted as human. However, the phrase, “Where the crawdads, sing”, is fully defined by Owens thus cannot be confused in her novel The reference to their presumed music as defined by Owens is one of her many uses of a colloquialism. She spells it out using the complete phrase, “ Way out yonder where the crawdads sing”. More context for the less colloquial is that the full phrase means in the middle of nowhere. Which is exactly where the story takes place. In the middle of nowhere. It takes place in a marsh (not a swamp, there's a difference) along some stretch of coast on the eastern seaboard of the United States. The exact location doesn’t exist. It’s fictional. Owens includes a map, which I referenced frequently. Mind you, this is no Narnia, this is no Middle Earth, but this is as real a place, even more real, than any presumed backdrop for any other great novel. West Egg for instance. Just like West Egg on the north shore of Long Island, this marsh on the eastern shore of North Carolina cannot be found on any map, nevertheless, it’s a place I would like to visit.

The phrase, thus, refers to being beyond the most remote area of the wild as possible. Off the map, off the grid. Way out yonder where the crawdads sing. A place, very different from, and as remote as, any place in Africa where Owens spent much of her professional life as a naturalist. Beyond anything we know, the marsh she created is truly in the middle of nowhere. It is here where the main character, Kya, finds herself alone. She has been left alone by family and most of humanity. We are witness to the abandonment. As a little girl she is forced to live on her own and survive in the wild. Shades of Jody Foster from the movie Nell…except she speaks English and she has a lot more food to eat. That is, if you like seafood. Mussels and smoked fish, and whatever sprouts from a shabby wild vegetable garden. She was not raised by wolves, or gorillas, but instead by the marsh itself. And a lot of seagulls and other sea birds. The marsh is her mother. Most of us couldn’t fathom the life of Kya--essentially on her own since age seven. Think about that for a moment…if you don’t cry…you should. I cried three times in the first 125 pages of the story. I cried 4 or 5 more times before the end of the story.

This book, I presume since Owens is well read having spent a lot of time on her own, crosses many genres. Her naturalist side shines through as the wild is on display on every page. Yet her story is a murder mystery since the body of Chase Andrews is found dead in the marsh in the prologue. She uses poetry frequently. Her own poetry, which is quite good. And of course, it is a love story of deep dimension. Difficult--to say the least--because finding love in the middle of nowhere is not easy. Unless you find it within yourself. One can’t say it’s a coming of age story, since the novel spans all of Kya’s lifetime…but yes…a Marsh Girl can come of age…and have it all. And of course there is the courtroom scene related to the murder. Pick an author, Grisham, perhaps. We shall see when Hollywood releases their version in a few months how Owens dialogue holds up to Perry Mason. Will the courtroom dialogue be credible? Despite Kya’s profound literacy, which you will discover on her journey, Kya doesn’t pull a Lisbeth Salander (Stieg Larsson) and turn the tables on the court. She’s more humble, crippled outside her marsh, withdrawn from the process, meditating, and mostly concerned with the cat who lives in the court house. If you are rooting for her, as I was, prepare for another bout of tears.

The book is a page turner because this story jumps from the pages and comes alive in your mind. Kya is real. She is alive. She will now exist in literature just as Captain Ahab and his whale. Kya and her Marsh. Owens brought her to life through her thoughts, her paintings, her poetry, and her music. Perhaps the best apologetic for an absent family, Owens walks through the conditions that must have been present for those responsible for her abandonment to receive forgiveness. As well as those who cared, but not enough, to keep her isolated. The reckoning, in the courtroom, was perhaps insufficient. Justice could never be served for the rising fear and prejudice visited upon this young girl by a town full of ignorant people. Yet some did rise above, in their own way, and Kya understood. It’s her understanding of human nature, through the eyes of our own evolution that shows us that we are not too far removed from the animal kingdom. There but for the grace of God…not into the fires of hell but rather into the bountiful Garden of Eden--the Marsh. The sins of the animal kingdom cannot be judged as sins--as when an injured mother fox leaves her kits in order to survive to another day where perhaps she may rear another litter when survival is more certain. Can the momma fox be judged?

This is perhaps Owen’s legacy. Crawdads don’t sing--a fiction at best and anthropomorphism at worst. She knows it. Animals do not take on human characteristics. Only the truly ignorant would believe things move in that direction. Fake naturalists such as Elizabeth Marshall Thomas (The Hidden Life of Dogs) springs to mind as the purveyor of such garbage. Rather we can now look to Owens as the author of something as profound and insightful as from the true greats like Henry David Thoreau who wrote, ""In wildness is the preservation of the world”. Here is where Owens lives. Here is where Owens sings. Her voice a whisper above the din but a true voice calling out in the wilderness to be heard above the wind through the palmetto trees or the waves crashing on the sand leading into the marsh. To the gulls who circle above the beach and are friends with Kya as she sleeps. To the other wildlife that saunter by her without pause. She is one of them, not the other way around. Justice, therefore, is a natural one and subscribes to nature’s law. Balance in this natural world can always be restored. This is the true beauty of Owens' novel and no doubt the key to her success. Five-Stars for Owen’s first novel and this literary feat. A must read for everyone who claims they read books. Kya will stay with me, and you, forever...",positive

Kya Clark is a small child when she is abandoned by her mother, then her siblings, and lastly, her father who leaves one day to never come back. His father was abusive and this is why her mother and siblings left the Marsh.

Kya gets nicknamed the Marsh Girl and she learns to survive on her own thanks to nature and her own desire to make it.

In 1969, Kya is a young woman when the body of Chase Andrews is found and the townspeople point a finger at Kya as the main suspect. After all, rumor has it that Chase visited her all the time.

Where the Crawdads Sing brought out so many emotions from sadness to anger to disappointment to happiness.

Delia Owens makes the Marsh a character on its own. She did a wonderful job at bringing it to life. The way Kya learns from it was amazing!

The isolation that Kya suffers because of where she was from was heartbreaking to read. A young kid left behind by everyone and no one really cared to help her except for Tate and Jumpin'. She was misunderstood and cast away, worse than an animal. Then there was the mystery of who killed Chase and why. If I'm being honest, I figured it out early on. However, I still like the way the story developed.

Time to watch the movie.

53,Books,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.98,4,"The storyline in this novel is good, but not strong, and the lush, detailed descriptions of the North Carolina wetlands and marshes are exquisite. Kya is a sympathetic character from the beginning, but I felt like she never really grew much as a person. Her outlook on life remained childlike even into old age. The ending was not surprising other than the identity of the poetry writer, and while the last chapter wrapped those interspersed poems together, I found them distracting throughout the novel - I wasn't sure why some of them were there. I think I could have found the ending a little more plausible if Kya had shown any deep-seated anger for everyone who disappeared from her life (and everyone did), and she forgave some of them, but not others, and ultimately acted on one with a wave of anger I didn't get from her throughout the story. Loneliness and loss, yes. Some anger at those whose attrition she never understood, yes. But angry enough to do the unspeakable? I didn't get this vibe from her character's psychological profile.

As a lawyer, I thought the courtroom scenes were very well done, but when Kya's lawyer didn't put her on the stand to testify, I knew what the outcome would be. That probably wouldn't resonate with the average reader, so it worked well, though that part of the plotline was pushing the limits a bit. No matter how well-read Kya became as she educated herself with Tate's help (and unless she was a prodigy, she wouldn't have learned as much as she did in five years), I don't think she would have had enough experience with the real world or the knowledge to set up and successfully navigate her actions with the precision she did where Chase was concerned. The author also didn't do enough research into the State of North Carolina concerning distances (it's a good eight hours or more from the fictional town she lives near to Asheville), family histories (her father's family didn't come from a plantation near Asheville - there weren't any of those - mostly small farms), and dialects of characters from different parts of the state (the ones with accents were either evil or not, but Kya spoke perfect dialect free English). All that aside, this book isn't a bad first novel, though the author's developmental editor should have fixed some of the problems it has. I don't think it's bestseller material.",positive
54,Books,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.98,4,"Well, I read the entire book in one day, so I can't say it didn't hold me until the end, but so much of it was disappointing, given the hype and the gushing over it. The descriptions of the marsh and of Kya's awakening as she learned to read and found entire worlds to explore near her home were brilliant. But the love stories read like a cheesy romance novel, a jarring contrast from the much more nuanced nature writing, and something I couldn't get past.
The dialogue, for the most part, felt like it belonged in a different book, considering how great the descriptive passages are. Very little of it rang true, and some of the dialect was off-putting and offensive--as in the conversations with Jumpin' and Mabel. (Shades of Steppin Fetchit.)
Chase said 'ya' instead of 'you', as if to differentiate him from every other character--or to make him appear dumb or a lowlife. I don't know what it was all about, but it got to me after awhile.
As others have said, the poetry was irritating instead of inspiring. None of it seemed to apply until the last one at the end, which may be intentional. Again, I don't know. Tate did say he thought the poetry was weak.
The courtroom scenes were quite good. They, in fact, were what kept me reading to the end.
The back and forth between the years got really irritating and a little amateurish.
There was a brief passage written in second person before she went back to third person, and I wondered how an editor missed that.
That, and the rather silly romantic dialogue, became distractions. A shame, because Kya has such a beautiful story to tell.
And lastly, I'm glad I read the book before I read the reviews here, since so many readers decided to give the entire plot away. Why would anyone do that with a book that's essentially a murder mystery--emphasis on 'mystery'?",positive
55,Books,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.98,5,"Kya lives in the marshlands of North Carolina with her poverty stricken family. Her father is abusive and, one by one, her siblings leave and, eventually, so does her mother. Her father stays and he seems better for a time, even kind. Then he falls back into his old ways again and ends up leaving too. Kya tries school for a day but after being bullied, she doesn’t return. She makes it completely on her own and digs mussels to sell to the local store to bring in money for food. Tate, a boy a few years older than Kya, loves to explore the marsh. They become friends and he teaches her to read. With reading, she discovers and teaches herself to be literate and all about the marshlands and its nature. She illustrates and collects samples of everything she finds in her marsh area. Tate leaves to attend college and becomes a biologist and works in the marsh. He submits Kya’s illustrations and notes to a publisher and she becomes a published author several times over. She adds comforts to her house and lives well by her own wealth. She lives simply but she gets electricity and running water and other basic comforts that she's never had. When Tate went away to college, he realized that his life would be difficult for Kya. So, he doesn’t visit her for years. While he’s away, the local and popular Chase moves in on Kya. He tricks her into thinking he’s going to marry her, all the while dating other women. Kya eventually sees his engagement article in the local newspaper and ends it with him. Later, he attacks her, trying to rape her and he beats her up. She fights back and escapes. His body is found later and it looks like he fell from the fire tower in the marsh. Since he was a local celebrity, the police are pushed to investigate for foul play. Kya is arrested and faced with a murder trial. The whole time I’m reading the part after Chase attacks Kya, I’m hoping she killed him but I also don’t want her to be found guilty. The suspense builds to intensity and I couldn’t put the book down! Tremendously honest, heartbreaking and soul healing! 5 stars!",positive
56,Books,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.98,3,"I'm an avid reader and tend to read more literary fiction by contemporary writers, or mystery fiction by British, Irish, and Scandinavian writers (a lot of American mystery series are very one dimensional).

Typically I find a lot of best sellers are pretty one dimension too, but they make for great Netflix or HBO series, or films (Big Little Lies, Sharp Objects, etc.). Anyway - I really didn't want to read this book because so many people liked it, but sometimes a great book ends up being a massive hit - Gone Girl was really good, The Midnight Library, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (I still love Scandinavian Crime Fiction thanks to this International hit).
But for some reason, the last few years, I kept putting this book in my cart, then taking it out, then reading reviews and putting it back in, then reading other reviews and taking it out. Needless to say, I was going to not ever read it, but my husband who doesn't typically read fiction but who loves the coast of our state - NC - wanted to read it. So we decided to read it together which was such a new and awesome experience. This is what is good and bad about the book in my opinion:

Good:
The description of the landscape. The author is a nonfiction / naturalist and zoologist / ecology writer, so she had amazing description of the animals, marshes, and coast. You could really get lost in these descriptions and this is probably the best thing about the book.

Kya - the protagonist - is a survivor and a character you root for because she's been treated so badly - by her family and everyone else. She's an interesting character in that her loneliness leads her to her passion for the marshes and coast, and as an introvert myself who would rather be alone than around people at times - I envied her isolated shack near the beach and her ability to just hang out exploring the coast all day.

Kya's friendship with Jumpin' and Mabel - they are both warm hearted characters who help Kya when she is young and are almost like adoptive parents to her, although they don't impede too much on her life. I liked their bond and thought it was plausible.

The metaphors the author uses between the animal / natural world and Kya's life / experiences. These were interesting, and definitely ""in your face"" as you were reading, but I learned things about the natural world I didn't know before and a few of the comparisons made me think which I always appreciate.

The bad:
The dialogue is not believable at all. Characters speak like they are living in the same Louisiana Parish as the characters from ""Steel Magnolias,"" and even though these are Southern folks who might be more isolated on the coast - and it's the 60s - no one speaks like this in NC (the accent). Also - characters always speak in full sentences to one another and explain their thoughts and feelings as if they are all very emotionally mature and well rounded people rather than broken and dysfunctional. Kya doesn't really speak like this most of the time, but everyone else does. People just don't speak like this to one another - in full sentences, and able to explain their thoughts and feelings so clearly - right in the moment. If this were the case, we would all be in a much more peaceful world. Communication is hard in the real world - especially when you are hurting and broken. The way the characters explain everything they are thinking so well and in full sentences makes the book kind of cheesy at times and almost like a YA read. This aspect of the book just didn't go with the landscape descriptions.

The love triangle:
It's pretty typical that in most popular books featuring a romance, you'll have the love triangle with the awkward yet beautiful chic in the middle - loved by two men. I understand it's value to drive suspense, but Tate and Chase both end up being kind of douches.

Things just don't make sense in a lot of ways:
No snakes in this book? Asheville as a destination from the Coast? No one in town trying harder to help this girl who everyone knows lives on her own? Some things just don't add up, including the mystery itself and why the Sheriff wants to pin it on Kya so much when his life would be easier if he just called it an accident as it looked to be anyway. I think she was capable enough of raising herself based on her ability to feed herself and the friends she made along the way, but she never really got hurt - other than the nail which doesn't seem plausible.

Overall - I'm looking forward to seeing the film because I absolutely love the landscape in this story and want to see Kya's shack and the way she interacts with nature which is the best thing about this story. The book was uneven to say the least, and it's certainly not going to be on the AP English literature reading list one day. But it has a protagonist that most people would love to root for, and the setting is great.

For a book featuring atmospheric natural landscape descriptions and interesting characters with unique experiences, as well as literary prose, I recommend Swamplandia by Karen Russell. It's set in the Everglades and captured my imagination in a way this story wasn't able to.",fair
57,Books,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.98,4,"The book that everyone is talking about - and I had to see for myself. Plus I wanted to see the movie, and whenever there’s a movie based on a book, I prefer reading the book first.

I loved the premise, a murder mystery, a historical coming of age story about a girl abandoned by her family and forced to rely only on herself living in the marsh, a celebration of nature, and the unique growing pains she goes through.

I enjoyed being on Kya’s journey with her and watching her grow from an abandoned, confused little girl to being a self-sufficient adult. It hurt to read about her getting hurt, but the few friends she makes along the way are true.

Not the biggest fan of the writing style, and the head hopping got a little confusing (though I don’t read much literary fiction so I don’t know if this is normal?) at times and I wasn’t a fan of the court scenes - felt jarring and out of place. It’s told in two timelines that eventually merge - one of Kya’s life, the other of the ongoing murder investigation of one of her ex-boyfriends, but markings of the year under each chapter prevents confusion.

Overall I’m glad she got her happy ending - though the end end throws in a twist I didn’t see coming. I’m looking forward to the movie!",positive
58,Books,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.98,5,"I love this book. I purchased it so I'd have something to read on vacation, and it was the perfect book to take.

From the first page, I got lost in the marshes of North Carolina, and the world in which the heroine Kya lives. Time jumps forward and back, but jumps perfectly to keep the stories past and current (1969) simultaneously moving to the climax. The stories kept me so enraptured that I literally stayed up half the night to finish it. I couldn't put the book down for anything. And I'm glad.

Crawdads felt very much like To Kill a Mockingbird. Simple time, southern home town, prejudice, murder, and a trial with a defense attorney similar to the beloved Atticus Finch. The descriptions of the people, town, marsh, and wildlife, make you feel as if you are there experiencing everything with the characters. And the story will keep you guessing until the end.

When I turned the last page, part of me was extremely disappointed only because I didn't want the story to end. It's a rare book that can pull me in so completely, and this one did just that. I just wanted to keep reading, and reading, and reading.

Order this book, and carve out a quiet space and time so you can immerse yourself. Get comfy with a box of Kleenex and prepare for a journey to the marshes of the South, back in the sixties before technology we enjoy today, when you could slow down long enough to feed the seagulls on the beach, and search for shells and feathers in the warm breeze of the North Carolina coast.",positive
59,Books,Where the Crawdads Sing,$9.98,5,"My sister recommended this book to me some time ago and I agreed to add it to my TBR list but wasn't all that enthused to start it as I've been getting into the spicier novels lately, so it got tossed somewhat in the middle of my list. I finished the series I had been reading yesterday and didn't know where to go from there but immediately thought of this book. I am SO glad I did!! This book has had me feeling so much in the last day and a half. At one point I felt so sad for Kya and then the next minute I would be so happy for her and then the next chapter I would be absolutely mad on her behalf or cursing her in my mind for wanting to see the good in someone who didn't deserve it. I am honestly sad for this story to be over but I am happy to say that every question that I had throughout this story was answered by the end of it and I really do feel like it all came together amazingly and allowed readers to not only glimpse Kya's life but experience every bit of it with her. I love this book. I will likely read a few other books and then come back to this again as I sometimes do with other stories that I've truly enjoyed. The details provided really help you paint a picture in your mind and allow you to feel like you're there with Kya, experiencing her marsh and nature through her eyes. 10/10 do recommend!",positive
60,Books,I'm Glad My Mom Died,$18.84,5,"THIS IS BY FAR, THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ ALL YEAR BY DEFAULT and I give Jennette McCurdy many props for writing this blockbuster of an read while being extremely honest about it and no sugarcoating, unapologetic, unfiltered, uncensored, no holds barred and a damn great fascinating read. ALREADY ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS OF ALL TIME!

Right from page one, I was taken on a journey about her life growing up, the difficulties with her own mother with the emotional, physical AND psychological (going as FAR on her mother being in the shower with her until she was 17 while ""examing"" her in the process, made me gag) with being forced to be anorexic even as an 11-year old and parts of her adulthood made me cry really hard chapter by chapter and I couldn't even put down this book even for a second. None of the abuse that she has suffered isn't okay at all, child star or not, BAR NONE.

The stuff with her writing about the Creator made me really angry and sad especially the costume tests with the bikinis as she being underage at the time while her mother encouraging it truly horrified me to the core as I totally wished that I want to punch the Creator and even more after reading as justice for Jennette.

Also, the BTS stories on the real experiences of working on ""Sam & Cat"" that she wrote about even nearly getting her chance to finally show her directing skills only to be taken away from her at the eleventh-hour filming on set of S&C as they shattered her dreams while Nickelodeon tried to bribe her with a $300,000 hush money settlement for not going public about her experiences working with the network as she did the right thing on turning down after them protecting a predator for so very long.

The biological father twist was a huge twist to and how her cancer-stricken mom died while lying to her for her entire life even from beyond the grave disgusted me even more that she was forced to be the perfect daughter for a mom who I might as well say, ""The ULTIMATE NARCISSIST Mother from Hell that could Joan Crawford a run for her money"" and the journey of actually meeting her real father.

It was like sitting down and having coffee with Jennette as I was moved by her story and her finally getting her long-needed vindication with the difficulties of being a former child star and getting to share her story to the world and telling a true statement and reason why she doesn't want to return to the show that made her a household name and I don't blame her even after reading this blockbuster of an read with the amount of anxiety that has been stuck with her for years while living in an image that she didn't fit in with and never getting to experience her childhood courtesy of her own mother.

I admire Jennette's strength and determination for having to write this book even if it isn't for everyone and the amount of hours and years of healing. I say this from one writer to another, YOU HAVE A NATURAL TALENT FOR WRITING AND I'M SO READY FOR MORE OF YOUR FUTURE WORK WITH THIS NEXT STEP.

I GIVE THIS BOOK, 11 OUT OF 10 STARS AND TO BE HONEST, 1 BILLION STARS OUT OF 5 as a huge fan of her work and so many mad props and many positive praises that I won't be able to list about my life for this book cause Jennette McCurdy is one hell of an storyteller and I totally wish that I could meet her and give her a nice huge hug with my list of congratulations on how I really, really loved this book to which I'm sure she might be reading this review. :)

After reading this, I too am strongly glad that her mother died too and I have been hyped for this book for months and it is finally here as I totally hope others can read her story despite the overwhelming demand for this book and I hope you can see things in a different light after you read this masterpiece of a book along with some of the finest cover art I have seen in quite a long time with the most UNORTHODOX but really the greatest book title I have ever seen in years of all my life growing up reading books and all of 2022.

Already planning to re-read it again and again and planning to get the audiobook to fully experience this with her narration. GET THIS BOOK ASAP AND I'm glad her mom died also.

I totally hope the success of this book will make Hollywood really wake up about former child stars being mistreated for different reasons and having their stories being told like Jennette's while putting Dan Schneider once and for all behind bars while we're at it for all the crimes he also committed toward her.",positive
61,Books,I'm Glad My Mom Died,$18.84,4,"I had my child at 38. By the time she was finished with cartoons and started liking ""peoplie"" shows I was in my 40's . ICarly, Sam & Cat were 2 of her favorites. I have to admit I loved both of those shows as well. Jeanette was our absolute favorite on both shows. So, funny. Great comedic timing and great physical comedy skills as well. We never understood why she just disappeared. Respect to her co-stars but I always felt Jeanette had the talent to keep moving. Reading this book really helped me understand. She was abused by her mom on so many levels. The showering and ""exams"" till she was 17 was the most glaring and disturbing example of her lack of boundaries. So many parents especially mothers create eating disorders in their children. They know they're doing it, they know how terrible it is. It was done to them and instead of breaking that cycle they just keep pushing the they way they were pushed. Her mother gave her a terrible relationship with food that she may never fully reconcile. I was extremely overweight as a child I was so lucky I had the world's greatest mom. She always gently tried to push me to make good decisions and to eat healthier I was already a super active kid but I was 250 lbs in 7th grade and I walked into every room like I owned it. Never occurred to me to feel bad about the way I looked. I had a mother who loved me and instilled such a confidence in me and I'm lucky I still carry with me today. I have never fully reconciled my relationship with food. Addictions on any level of very hard. I've also struggled with alcohol and drugs in my life even cigarettes. But the sad reality is you can lock somebody in a room for 6 months without any of those things and they won't die. If you lock somebody in a room without food you're going to die. So you need to come to some sort of understanding with food to develop as healthy a relationship as you can because it's something quite literally no one can't live without. I always enjoy watching the aforementioned shows, but after reading this book I love her even more. She's a wonderful woman she's done a great job. I fell in love with her when I was 40's, she inspired me then and in my 50s she's still inspires me after reading this book I wish her nothing but success in love, life and in the future. Most of all I wish for Jeanette to fully love herself. I wish total healing and I hope someday she can love herself as much as the world does!

62,Books,I'm Glad My Mom Died,$18.84,5,"I read A LOT and have literally never written a review but...

...Omg, omg, omg this book is so real, shocking, sad, relatable, unpredictable and somehow really funny at the same time.

She is a really talented writer with a wild ass story.

I also grew up with a mother who has NPD - and royally screwed up the relationship with my bio dad and robbed my youth from me - and saw all the classic signs. My mom is still with me and I secretly feel so much relief to think of when she's not here torturing me anymore.

Your family is a roll of the dice - you don't get to choose them. And not everyone gets a good one.

This book is permission and grace to not feel required to have toxic people in your life simply because they are blood related (which you had no choice in - you didn't ask to be born).

And to face the hard stuff for YOUR benefit (no one else's) and come out of the other side so much better for it.

I do wish there was more of this book only because it was so good:

- more on the real dad (where is he? do they talk? How did her mother even have TIME for an affair since it seems like she was constantly up Jeanette's ass?)
- also, who she is now. It focuses a lot on the past vs. present and she has come SO far.

I will read or watch anything she writes and can't wait for the next thing (hope there is one!) Like write a series, movie, play - you've got SKILLS Jeanette!",positive
63,Books,I'm Glad My Mom Died,$18.84,5,"I finished the audiobook within 24 hours. It's read by the author, so you get to experience this story through her voice, which I highly recommend.

I'm not famous, never acted, and I've never suffered an eating disorder, but still relate to McCurdy in so many ways. The first half of her book perfectly captures the experience of being a people-pleasing child surrounded by broken adults. You know something is wrong, but you're unable to name it or explain why it's wrong, and as a child you can't escape it. Navigating your life becomes a terrible game, it's not fun, but being ""good"" at that game also gives you a sick sense of pride.

The latter half speaks to mental illness, familial myths, and abuse. The aftermath of such an upbringing.

I liken the overall feeling of this book to a childhood injury I had. I was like, 7, and I got hit in the face by a bungee cord. (Right above my eye.) I felt pain when it struck me, but I was oddly fine. I didn't even cry. It wasn't until I climbed on the toilet to see myself in the bathroom mirror that things changed. I saw how bad the wound was, and knew the moisture on my face was blood, not sweat like I had thought. After knowing, the wound felt different. And I cried, got stitches, and ended up with a permanent scar.

McCurdy was a child, living the life she knew, recognizing in her own way that things were bad, bargaining and rationalizing those feelings away to survive, to win, until she found herself lost, broken, and unhealthy as an adult. Once you know things, you can't go back.

It's a dark story, but a relatable one, and it's recounted with enough dark humor to give you a breath before you sink too deep. I loved it, I'm rooting for McCurdy, and I look forward to reading (or listening) to more of her work in the future.",positive
64,Books,I'm Glad My Mom Died,$18.84,5,Sheesh! This was written perfectly. Jeanette explores the foundation of her relationship with her mother while also trying to find herself and where she might have taken a wrong turn. This books just goes to show that money can't fix the things inside of you that are already broken until you do a little work yourself. There's some tearful moments and some light hearted moments. Growing up as an iCarly fan it read like a behind the scenes bit at times. I remember some of the episodes mentioned. While she was busy making us laugh on screen off screen she was not doing well. I'm happy she's better now and I understand why she named the title what the title is. Her journey to stability and health took some time for her to understand that her mother was not the hero she thought she was. That's a hard pill to swallow.,positive

This was so beautifully written and the awareness that Jennette has about certain things (and later on after some guidance) is remarkable. You truly never know what happens behind closed doors, and social media/media in general is fake, and this is proof of that. It's truly sad to hear about everything she went through to get to where she is now, but I am so happy for her that she made it.

There’s so much raw truth and it is so unapologetic.
I enjoyed seeing her start to make strides in her personal life and show the ups and downs that came with it. I truly hope she continues to thrive and live her life fully and for herself, whatever that might mean for her.

I have absolutely no guilt surrounding this either. I too cut off family who want to continue to use me as a scapegoat, a lost mother figure, a cook, a cleaner, a protector. I understand her relationship with food, because of my own experiences as a child, I have a stockier build, so if I complained of being hungry, I’d be mocked “is your fat quivering?” So I just learned to make my own food, tried to never complain about hunger pangs.

69,Books,I'm Glad My Mom Died,$18.84,5,To be honest I was not expecting much from this book. I had never heard of her before (I'm 58 yrs old) I thought it would be another typical bad childhood/happy ending book. But I quickly changed my mind. She has been through literal hell both physically but especially mentally. Her mom who I think she is still too easy on; where's the well-deserved anger?! was a monster with no redeeming qualities that I can discern of. She practically destroyed her. Reading the book made me hate her for what she put her daughter and sons through. Not to mention her unfortunately weak father who failed in his duty to protect them from her abuse. She has accomplished so much in searching and working hard to attain some semblance of mental wellness. And it seems she has achieved that.. She fought and tackled an enormous mountain that many are unable to accomplish. She is Brave. She is intelligent and funny besides that. I hope she knows that no one can achieve total happiness. But it sounds like she is doing a damn good job of living her life. She has my very best wishes to have alot of peace and happiness in her life. I thank her for sharing herself with us.

70,Books,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo: A Novel,$9.42,5,"“I spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much I loved her.”

This is one of the best books I’ve ever had the privilege to read. It is probably in the top five for best books I’ve ever read in my entire life. I have been looking for a book like this my entire life, and no combination of words I’m about to type, and you’re about to read, is going to do this masterpiece justice. But I will say that Gabby, Joce, Amelie, and Elyse were all right, and I’m so happy I listened to them, because this book is worth every single ounce of hype.

And when I say that this book is lifechanging, I truly mean it. This book is sold as a historical romance, where you learn about a fictional, famous, old Hollywood actress and all her marriages. What you get is a book that stars a bisexual, Cuban woman who was never allowed to talk about the love of her life; her wife. And when I say I cried during this book, I truly mean that I probably need to buy a new copy because I was the biggest mess you’ve ever seen.

“And it will be the tragedy of my life that I cannot love you enough to make you mine. That you cannot be loved enough to be anyone’s.”

On top of this being a powerful book about race, sexuality, misogyny, and having to conform to societies norms, the true meaning I took from this book is that life is short, so damn short, and we shouldn’t spend it pretending to be something we aren’t. And we shouldn’t spend it doing anything less than loving the people who are worthy and deserving of our love.

“I didn’t need boys in order to feel good. And that realization gave me great power.”

We follow Evelyn from the very start; losing her mother very young, her body developing very quickly, noticing others noticing her developing body, marrying a man so she can leave the dead-end city she grew up in, so she can become something more. Evelyn is unapologetic with her actions, and it is one of the most empowering things I’ve ever read. She plays so many more parts than the roles she is cast in. And Evelyn learns really quickly how to play each and every man she is forced to interact with, and she quickly learns what she can gain from each and every one of them, too.

This story is told from two different timelines and two different points of view. One from Monique Grant, who is a biracial (white and African-American) woman who is going through a fresh divorce and trying to make something of herself in the journalism field. And her life changes the day her editor tells her how Evelyn Hugo is demanding her, and only her, to write something for her.

“Heartbreak is loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.”

The other timeline(s) are all the different times in Evelyn’s life, and the different seven husbands that she had, while she is recounting the events that lead her to be telling Monique this story. Evelyn has lived a very full life, and is in her late seventies now, and is finally ready to talk about her life. But the entire book we are guessing why she has chosen only Monique for this job.

“Make them pay you what they would pay a white man.”

If you guys have been following my reviews, you’ll probably know that I talk about found family and how important it is to me a lot, but The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is the epitome of how beautiful a found family can be. Evelyn and Harry’s friendship in this was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever read in my entire reading life.

“When you write the ending, Monique, make sure the reader understands that all I was ever really looking for was family. Make sure it’s clear that I found it. Make sure they know that I am heartbroken without it.”

And the romance? The true romance in this book is the most romantic thing I have ever read in my entire life. And you guys know I’ve read a ton of romances, but they are all lesser to this. Every single one of them can’t compare with the romance in this book. I feel like every time I’ve used the word “perfect” to describe something that wasn’t the romance in this book, then I used the word wrong.

“Please never forget that the sun rises and sets with your smile. At least to me it does. You’re the only thing on this planet worth worshipping.”

How many Evelyn and Celias are there in the world? How many are still playing the role that Evelyn was forced to play? I cry for every single person who must hide who they are, and who they want to love. And this book talks about many big things in LGBTQIAP+ history; from the Stonewall riots to the disgusting Reagan administration, but life still isn't anywhere close to equal in 2018. The prejudices, the discrimination, the virus/syndrome blaming, the looks I’ve experienced holding a girl’s hand while walking into a restaurant? Those are still in 2018, in the United States, but people act like none of those things exists because marriage is legalized, begrudgingly. I’m not writing this review to get on my soapbox, but I promise, we have a lot more work to do. And this book, this book lit a fire under me.

I personally identify as pansexual, but I felt like the bisexual rep in this was a tier above anything my eyes have ever seen. Seeing Evelyn love all the parts of her, and all the different parts of her love, was something so awe-inspiring. I am still so overwhelmed with feelings, but if you identify as bi or pan, this is a love letter to you, I promise.

“I was a lesbian when she loved me and a straight woman when she hated me.”

This book also focuses a huge importance on motherhood throughout the entirety of this book, and then I read the acknowledgement and started weeping all over again. Taylor Jenkins Reid was able to evoke the strongest emotions from me, and I just pray that things will be different for the generation of kids being raised right now.

This was the first thing I’ve read by Taylor Jenkins Reid, but I will buy every single new thing she produces. The writing was so lyrical and addicting. I mean, I have a quote between almost every paragraph. This whole book deserves to be highlighted. The characters, well, my mind has now forever imagined that these are real people now, so there is that. The topics, themes, and discussions are beyond important. This book just makes me feel so passionately. This book is one of the most empowering pieces of literature I’ve ever consumed. And I am not the same person I was before this book.

“I told her every single day that her life had been the world’s greatest gift to me, that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.”

If you guys ever take a recommendation from me; please have it be The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Please, I’m actually begging you. I promise, this book is lifechanging, and I equally promise you that this book changed mine. There is magic between these four-hundred-pages. Pure magic. This story is addicting, enthralling, and so important. And if you’re an Evelyn, in 2018, I see you, but I hope it doesn’t take you as long as it took her to be happy. This will forever be one of the best books of my life, and I’ll cherish it forever.

“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is “You’re safe with me”—that’s intimacy.”

71,Books,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo: A Novel,$9.42,5,"Starting at the young age of fourteen and ending when she’s seventy-nine (when we first meet Evelyn), Evelyn Hugo has gone from bombshell, to sexpot, to Oscar winner, to civil rights supporter. Evelyn knew what she wanted from an early age—to get out of Hell’s Kitchen and away from her abusive father, and to be the biggest star anyone has ever heard of. And she accomplished that! Partially because of her talent, partially because she knows her worth and is unafraid to get dirty in order to achieve her goals, and partially because there is no one better at using the press and scandals to serve their own interests. Evelyn is both a force to be reckoned with, but also a deeply flawed and lonely. Shown through the perspective of Evelyn as she dictates her memoir to Monique, the reader is taken back to the early days of Hollywood to watch Evelyn’s rise, and her stumbles, to and through stardom. For a story about a Hollywood starlet, this book is LAYERED, and I don’t think I was expecting the level of depth it had, even though many reviews warned me to expect the unexpected with this story.

In order to become Evelyn Hugo, Hollywood’s biggest star, Evelyn had to let go of who she was; erasing her identity to be what Hollywood wanted her to be. She knew and accepted this, always, but it does break your heart a little to watch her identity get stripped away so that she could be the blonde bombshell the screen so loved. The things Evelyn hid or changed, often denying the realest parts of herself in the process, really hit me in the feels, and there were parts at the end of the book that had me welling up with tears if that tells you anything. I won’t say more because the way the story unfolds is really lovely with getting to know all 7 of Evelyn’s husbands and the roles they played in her life, but I will say that I LOVED the inclusion of the fake articles to show the juxtaposition between what was Evelyn’s reality versus what the public got to see, and how the press portrayed her in return.

Honestly, there was very little I did not like about this book, or its story. It flowed beautifully and, while not necessarily one of those books you couldn’t put down (I had no issues stopping in reading for the night) it was never dull. It had a smooth, and highly enjoyable writing style. However, my only issues were that sometimes, with the book being told in 1st person, Monique didn’t always feel that distinct to me from Evelyn. Which may be mostly because we don’t really get to know Monique at the same level at which we get to know Evelyn, though I did enjoy their relationship and how they were able to help each other, even when that got . . . tricky, to say the least. But I also didn’t like Celia for a majority of the book, either. I found her to be so frustrating at times, that I often wondered why Evelyn even bothered having her around. Thankfully that changed toward the end, but still.

But, all in all, I LOVED this book and this story. It was so empowering, watching Evelyn be so unashamed to own her beauty, her sex appeal, her confidence, and to be the ball-buster she was, so unafraid of telling people what she wants, what she deserves—all because she knows her worth. I didn’t know how much I needed a story, to see a woman like that, until I read this book. But I also loved that the author didn’t shy away from Evelyn’s flaws, or the fact that, for a lot of Evelyn’s life, she was deeply lonely. Evelyn wasn’t perfect, but she didn’t let that be an excuse for anyone to treat her poorly. I will say there are some instances of spousal abuse in this book though, so just be forewarned if that kind of trauma is sensitive for you. I thought the author handled those topics amazingly well, but I’ve also never experienced such things for myself, either. Because this book brought tears to my eyes with that whole last third of the story, it easily gets 5 stars from me! This is such a satisfying, and empowering book!",positive
72,Books,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo: A Novel,$9.42,5,"“Evelyn always leaves you hoping you’ll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.”

In a stunning novel about love, hate, and perception, Taylor Jenkins Reid mesmerized me from the start. In a compelling tale about what you would do for true love, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo may be my new go-to book to recommend to fellow book lovers.

After being recommended this book to me numerous times, even with a huge TBR pile, I knew I had to get it finally and immediately read it – and everyone was correct! There is just something about Reid’s writing that pulls you in to the untouchable Hollywood movie glamour, describing the movie lots, gorgeous dresses, and the behind-the-scenes politics that goes into getting the roles of a lifetime.

Evelyn Hugo is one of the most famous actresses in the world but has been a recluse for years after being widowed by her seventh husband. Finally ready to tell her full story, she reaches out to Monique Grant – a magazine reporter – to divulge what the public and media has always desperately wanted to know. But why pick Monique?

I was raptured by Evelyn’s life; told in segments paralleled by the man she was currently married to. Her character is brave, unscrupulous, and unapologetic about what she has had to do to have a successful career. We quickly learn that life isn’t all about what is being spoon-fed to the media and that famous people are not afforded any privacy at the chance of selling a story: “The media are going to tell whatever story they want to tell.”

I was just as invested in Monique’s story as well, which Reid carefully intertwines while not distracting from Evelyn’s tale. And Celia and Harry’s characters add to the Hollywood Era and make their way into your heart as well. But Evelyn doesn’t let us forget that: “You’re not really famous if anybody still likes you.”

I truthfully had no idea what to expect when picking up this novel, but it was not this – this book left you wanting more while still feeling somehow like you lived it. We learn that both love and “hate is not uncomplicated” and not everything is how it meets the eye. Heavy topics were discussed with a certain beauty and ease that made you feel every emotion. This novel is simply put, a masterpiece! 5 stars!

73,Books,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo: A Novel,$9.42,4,"This book took me three attempts to read; finally, I was ready at the fourth attempt. Although, I didn’t find the beginning captivating, I’m the type of reader that must complete a book once started. It’s because I don’t want to wonder if something occurred in the story that became exciting.

In the case of this story, I’m so glad I stuck with it. I don’t want to give away any major spoilers, so I feel it’s safe to express the following: The story starts off during the 50s era. I didn’t find the stories regarding each of Evelyn’s husbands very interesting but I understood the reason for them. Being a movie icon, as Evelyn became, the big screen life wasn’t an easy one to venture through for women. During that era and decades after, women were looked upon for their beautiful face and/or voluptuous body. If talent was involved, that was a bonus for the directors/producers. Needless to say, Evelyn did what it took to become a legend.

I was really captivated by the friendship and love shared between Evelyn and Henry. I loved how genuine and heartfelt it was. The same goes for Evelyn and Celia. These two relationships is what kept me reading and rooting for their success in every area and torn when events weren’t going well.

The main character (besides Evelyn) was Monique who ends up being the chosen one by Evelyn, to write and publish her life story. In taking down Evelyn’s life events, there ends up being a surprise that I didn’t see coming. Any surprise thrown in a story that isn’t expected is awesome writing in my book.

As with age, comes death or death comes too soon. There was plenty of death and it painfully pulled at my heartstrings. Overall, the story was well put together and I did end up enjoying it.",positive

After reading this book, I felt that the people who thought this book was not that interesting and not worth their time must be individuals from a younger generation. I may well be incorrect in that assessment but what was contained in this work was a representation of the social morality at that time period.
I found the writing to be insightful as to how a woman had to use what physical traits seen as outstanding in different ways to get her foot in the door to have a chance at becoming famous.
Sexuality isn't something you can easily quantify. Slapping labels on others is short sighted and we love whoever we love often to our own surprise. I've seen wonderful marriages which were that way because they were kindred spirits.
I really enjoyed reading this book because it was honest to the relationships it portrayed and the self examination people go through in an attempt to justify their decisions.

It has relatable characters, thought invoking themes and beautiful writing; there are so many quotes that made my heart ache.

I didn’t know much about Daisy and the same can be said for Evelyn. It’s true. I’ve managed to avoid all spoilers for a book that’s five years old. And boy am I glad I did! The last 100 pages or so had me in tears. I know most of you have read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by this point, but in the event you haven’t I don’t want to spoil anything for you.

TSHOEH is one big dichotomy of many different traits and emotions: good/bad; love/hate; love/loss; success/failure; heartwarming/heartbreaking; ego/humility; forgiveness/retribution; used/user; truth/lies. It’s all of these things and more. In a nutshell, the book is exactly what the title implies, but it’s so much more. It’s a love story, but probably not the one you’re expecting. It also has a little bit of mystery one that’s seeded throughout. I loved every word of TSHOEH and from here on out TJR will be an auto-buy for me!

Evelyn Hugo, the book and the person are captivating and you want to know more and we have Taylor Jenkins Reid to thank for it. Reid is a masterful storyteller who makes you believe all of these characters are real people. And they are in a sense. Her characters may be famous, but they all suffer from the same issues and problems we all do. Sure she writes about fictional characters based on an amalgamation of real people, but she does it with such care and detail that it has you heading to the Goog, just to check and be sure that you are in fact reading fiction.

Why does it work? To quote the fictionally famous Penny Lane “Famous people are just more interesting.” I highly recommend this book, I read it in a day and a half.

Even though this is a work of fiction, it pulls back the curtain of Hollywood, old Hollywood specifically. However, I suspect a lot of these behind the scenes power play machinations still happen regularly, even in 2022 and I find that to be very, very sad.",positive

Overall,

So general fiction is not my usual preference for genre of books, I tend to lean more towards fantasy, science fiction and romance. I just like the added seasoning to my reading. With that said I really did enjoy this book. After hearing about it all over booktok and other platforms I decided that I may as well step out of my own comfort zone and give it a try. I am very glad I did. This book was a mix between loving and hating the main character. Evelyn is very aware of what kind of woman she is, and she was willing to do anything to get what she wanted. Including getting married 7 times. The true beauty of this book is her true relationships that she had with Harry and Ceilia. They were the ones who knew her best and understood her down to her core being. Everyone else only saw who Evelyn wanted them to see. The LGBTQ+ representation in its historical context is also really interesting.

Cover,

The cover is beautiful and as alluring as Evelyn Hugo herself. It draws you in to at the very least ask, what kind of book is this?

I was definitely interested in all the details of her life. I really didn't love Cecilia all that much and found her to be unforgiving. I did enjoy the relationship Evelyn and Harry had though. It was pure and just right. I was a little annoyed that Evelyn wasn't a super hands on mom until later. That was almost unforgivable as a mother myself, but she redeemed herself in that area for me. It was truly heartbreaking the way it happened though. Monique is the character I'm having a hard time deciding on. There are parts of her I like and others I don't enjoy.

80,Books,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,$11.98,5,"I previously wrote this review right after reading the book. Today, February 15th, after applying James’s system for 100 days on a few tiny habits, I feel compelled to share updates with you because they have sincerely worked.

I will divide the review into 5 parts. The first part is a summary of the book with short excerpts highlighted while taking notes. Next, I hope to share pieces of advice that have motivated me while building new habits. Following that, I will share how I implemented the first 3 habits throughout these months. Then, some thoughts to whom I would recommend reading the book. Last, there are 4 complementary readings.

SUMMARY

[Introduction] James starts by sharing personal strategies he implemented to recover from a serious accident in high school. That event forced him to improve the quality of his routine to get his life in order, coming to the conclusion that “we all deal with setbacks, but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you will end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.”

[Section I : The Fundamentals]

[Chapter 1] Here we learn the power of compounding effect: changes that seem small and unimportant at any given day will compound into remarkable results if we are willing to stick with them for months and years. James explains that “breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.” Comparing to habits, he shows that bamboo can barely be seen during the first couple of years while the roots grow underground before exploding for almost 100 feet into the air in a few weeks. From that perspective, we come to understand the best outcomes are generally delayed.

[Chapter 2] Based on a 3-layer concentric circle behavior change model—divided into outcome change, process change, and identity change—James explains that we should pay attention to our inner identity by focusing on beliefs, assumptions, and values. “Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.” The strongest changes, then, happen from inside out, starting from our identity, passing through the process, and ultimately changing the outcome.

[Chapter 3] In this chapter we are introduced to a 4-step framework, which is composed of cue, craving, response, and reward. James calls it 'The 4 Laws of Behavior Change'. He then explains that we can think of each law as a lever that influences our behavior—when the levers are in the right positions, they create good habits effortless whereas when they are in the wrong position, it is nearly impossible. Through examples, he explains that “the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.” Together they create a habit loop that, when repeated many times, habits become automatic.

[Section II : Make It Obvious]

[Chapter 4] A primer on how cues play a crucial role in predicting habit formation without consciously thinking about the outcomes. Once our habits become so common, the cues associated with them become essentially invisible because they are deeply encoded. If we want to create better habits, a good idea is to be aware of the cues. James finishes up by sharing a strategy called 'Habits Scorecard'—a simple exercise to become more aware of our behavior on a daily basis. We first write down a chronological list of our daily habits and, once we have a full list, we score each habit as an effective, ineffective, or neutral habit. Besides noticing what is actually going on, we can notice if certain behaviors help us become the type of person we wish to be.

[Chapter 5] The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms, and the 2 most common cues are time and location. When we make a specific plan for when and where we will perform a new habit, we are more likely to follow through. Stacking our habits by pairing a new habit with a current habit is a form to connect our behavior to our own advantage. An example when building a daily journaling habit would be: “after I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will journal for 5 minutes.”

[Chapter 6] This chapter shows how our environment plays a crucial role in defining habit behaviors. “Given that we are more dependent on vision than any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior.” To build good habits, then, we should either make desirable cues obvious in our environment or build new habits in a new environment to avoid fighting against old ones.

[Chapter 7] One of the most practical ways to break a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. As James points out, “it is easier to avoid temptation than resist it.”

[Section III : Make It Attractive]

[Chapter 8] James explains how the modern food industry has created products that are more attractive and addictive to consumers, and by doing so he shows that the more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. Every behavior that is highly habit-forming tends to be associated with higher levels of dopamine. It is the anticipation of a reward that motivates us to take action. “Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.”

[Chapter 9] “We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.” That said, it is common to pick up habits and behaviors from our parents, peers, and colleagues. There is also a tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the tribe. And, finally, we try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves. One of the best strategies to build better habits is to join a culture where the desired behavior is the normal behavior.

[Chapter 10] To avoid unnecessary and detrimental cravings, we should highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit by making it seem unattractive. “Habits are unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings.”

[Section IV : Make It Easy]

[Chapter 11] “All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.” The key component is to pay close attention to the frequency we perform a habit, not much for how long we have been practicing it.

[Chapter 12] Since every action requires a certain amount of energy, we are motivated to do what is easy. By contrast, the more energy required, the less likely it is to occur. “You don't actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. The greater the obstacle, the more friction there is between you and your desired end state.” That is why we should reduce the friction associated with our habits by creating a prosperous environment to make future actions easier.

[Chapter 13] There are decisive moments that deliver an outsized impact every single day. As James puts, these decisive moments are a fork in the road, sending us in the direction of a productive path or an unproductive one. To avoid procrastination, the skill of 'Showing Up' says that we should start a new habit by taking baby steps, making it as easy as possible to take action. “A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first 2 minutes should be easy. What you want is a gateway habit that naturally leads you down a more productive path.” He calls it the 'Two-Minute Rule', meaning that new habits should take less than 2 minutes to do in the beginning. Once the habit is established we can improve and master the finer details.

[Chapter 14] In order to keep bad habits away is to make them difficult in the first place. There are 2 interesting strategies to improve our future behavior. [1] Make good choices in advance before we can fall victim to temptation in the future. James gives a personal example by sharing that whenever he is looking to cut calories he will ask the waiter to split his meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served. If, however, he waits for the meal to be served and tries to eat just half, that would never happen. [2] Make onetime actions that can automate our future habits and deliver increasing returns over time such as buying a good water filter, unsubscribing from unwanted emails, moving to a friendlier neighborhood, buying a standing desk, or setting up automatic bill pay.

[Section V : Make It Satisfying]

[Chapter 15] We should make sure to feel immediately satisfied after performing a new habit to increase the odds that the behavior will be repeated next time. “The human brain has evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.” For that, we can add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run.

[Chapter 16] Here we learn how to measure our progress by tracking our habits. The immediate satisfaction it delivers—as mentioned earlier in Chapter 15—is one of the many benefits that standout. Besides that, James says, “when we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path.” The most basic format to track our habits is to get a calendar and mark an X each time we stick with our routine. One of the most important passages of the entire book is as follows: “If you miss one day, try to get back into it as quickly as possible. The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly.”

[Chapter 17] In order to prevent bad habits and/or eliminate unhealthy behaviors, James says that we could either add an instant cost to the action or make it painful. A habit contract is also another strategy to hold our accountability: “It is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don't follow through. Then you find one to two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you.”

[Section VI : Advanced Techniques]

[Chapter 18] We learn how to distinguish habits when genes may or may not influence our performance especially for competitive activities. “One of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills.” James proposes us to set some time apart to explore new activities in the beginning, before shifting our focus to exploit them thoroughly.

[Chapter 19] When we find the sweet spot of our ability we tend to learn best and fastest. The ‘Goldilocks Rule’ states that ""humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.”

[Chapter 20] One downside of certain habits, James explains, is that we may stop paying attention to the little details and errors. To counterbalance that we should review and reflect on the process over time to remain conscious of our own performance. Using a simple chart to convey his message, we learn that “the process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized.”

PERSONAL THOUGHTS

Reading the book twice helped me take better notes and capture details. In the meantime, I thought about 3 simple strategies that could improve our adherence to new habits. Let me share these strategies here with you, and in the following section, I will describe how I managed to cultivate the first 3 new habits upon reading the book—following the system proposed by James together with these 3 strategies.

[1] The first strategy is about determining a 'commitment time frame' to avoid excuses during this initial trial period. A 1-month time frame is a fair commitment, choosing to start on the first day of the month to practice it every single day for a full month. Just at the end of the period, I will take the time to reflect and evaluate the pros and cons.

[2] The next one is to choose only 1 new habit each month. In doing so we become familiar with the practice intentionally while we develop a sense of purpose.

[3] Last, during the first month of any new habit, I noticed that if I spend time exploring the details and the benefits, my motivation stays high. It doesn't only help us create better practices, but it is also inspiring to learn from others who have succeeded previously by adding the same habit into their lives. Podcasts, articles, videos, books, online courses, tutorials, and blog posts are all good sources.

IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW HABITS

[Nov 1, 2018] I had been wanting to journal on a daily basis for many years but that had never happened. Although I have carried a notebook with me for quite a while, it has never worked as a real journal—a daily routine, when we sit down and write personal thoughts, intentions, and reflections at around the same time. Instead, it has been mostly used to take notes during meetings, to write down ideas and thoughts, to express travel memories, and to doodle. Today, after 3+ months, I haven't looked back once, and still can't believe it took me that long to start this daily habit. During the first month, I read blog posts, watched videos, and even read a short and inexpensive book to foster my creativity.

[Dec 1, 2018] I have been impressed by the physical capabilities we can develop through body movement. Although yoga has been a special part of my life since I was 18, I hadn't given proper attention to handstands. But now, after 2+ months practicing it every day, it is rewarding to see improvements on a weekly basis. Again, I definitely recommend watching videos and reading tutorials to find your favorite method. This is the perfect habit to stack at the end or in the middle of any physical movement practice you may enjoy.

[Jan 1, 2019] By now we know the benefits of cold showers—ranging from healthier skin appearance all the way to a more resilient perspective of the world. I had previously taken cold showers for 3 months in 2017, but it was a “goal” mindset instead of a “habit” mindset. After that trial I set aside and, although I have kept taking cold showers once or twice a week since then, I wished cold showers was the default mode. Now, after 1+ month, I can't see myself taking warm showers. After all, it is about intention. Again, we can learn uncountable benefits of cold showers by reading success stories. One of my inspirations was Wim Hof. It isn't comfortable in the beginning of any chosen day, but after 3-4 minutes, both my breath and thoughts calm down.

Putting them together, these 3 habits don't take more than 30 minutes of my day. While I spend about 10 minutes journaling and 10 more minutes practicing handstands, I save 5 minutes taking cold showers because I won't stay any longer than necessary.

RECOMMENDATION

[1] First, if you have watched videos, listened to podcasts, read articles and books on habit formation and, after all that, you feel satisfied, then, please, save your money and time.

[2] However, if you are like me, that even after reading a few books on building habits and having successfully added good habits to your life, feel that there is still room for improvement, this book can be a terrific addition.

[3] Last, if you haven't spent much time and energy discovering a good system to build lasting habits while breaking bad ones, please, read this book.

COMPLEMENTARY READINGS

[1] Game Changers, by Dave Asprey, exposed me to a wealth array of ideas/habits/tools that have helped me decide which new habit to build next. The book is divided into 46 laws.

[2] Essentialism, by Greg McKeown, helped me focus on less but more important tasks, giving clarity to what matters most. This is especially interesting to break bad habits.

[3] The Talent Code, by Daniel Coyle, brought more motivation when learning new skills based on the assumptions that we develop new talents through deep practices, finding our ignition identity, and having the right coach to guide us genuinely. I read it many years ago, then, a few years back, I read his following book called The Little Book of Talent—which is perhaps even more to the point.

[4] The Systems View of Life, by Fritjof Capra, enlightened my perspectives on how nature and living beings are systematically integrated. It is a profound and slightly academic book that can complement Atomic Habits especially to tie together the 4-step framework into the feedback loop system.

I sincerely hope you, too, have fun while building new habits.

Take care,

81,Books,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,$11.98,5,"Atomic Habits by James Clear is one of those rare books that I immediately read twice in a row. It is filled with dozens of science-backed and actionable nuggets of wisdom. Do you want to improve any habits in your life? I heartily recommend Atomic Habits to you! We are all driven by our habits - many of which are unconscious. Below are 9 quotes and takeaways from this life-changing book:

1. ""Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run."" Atomic Habits explains why the little things you do every day matters. Your little habits matter. It may not seem like a big deal to skip a workout or to be kind, but it is a big deal. Imagine if you improved your habits by only 1% every day. You'd be dramatically a different person in a year. Then imagine if you let your habits decline by 1% every day. You'd be in a much worse spot in life overall a year from now. Your little habits - atomic habits - count for a lot in the long run. What little habits are you improving upon (or neglecting...) today?

2. ""You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."" This is such an important point in the book. Oftentimes we focus on goals in our life, while neglecting to focus on the systems that help us achieve goals. As an example, I had a friend who had the goal to complete a triathlon. He achieved this goal! And then he quit working out for the next year and got out of shape... He was so focused on achieving a goal that he neglected his underlying systems of being healthy. Goal achievement can actually set us back if we don't get set up sustainable systems. Get the systems right and then we'll indeed also achieve our goals. Systems > Goals.

3. ""Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity."" I love this quote from the book. Every action - every habit - you take casts a vote for the type of person you want to become. Do you want to be a more organized person? When you develop habits and systems that organize your life, you are casting votes for thinking of yourself as an organized person. You think to yourself, ""hey, I'm an organized person."" And then you reinforce that belief with your habits and actions - a virtuous cycle! The flip side of this can be true too. What if you often show up late to meetings? You're casting votes that may make you think ""well, I'm just a person that is always late."" An un-virtuous cycle. Be careful to make sure that your habits and ultimately your beliefs cast votes for the type of person you want to become and, indeed, who you truly are.

4. ""How long does it actually take to form a new habit? You just need to get your reps in."" Atomic Habits answers the question of ""how much time does it take to form a new habit"" with a better answer of : X number of actions. Meaning, you may need to simply complete a new habit 100 times for it to stick, which could be done in 3 days or 3 weeks or 3 months, depending on the new habit. It is better to think of forming new habits in terms of consistently taking action, versus trying to stick to a habit for just X number of days. Get your reps in.

5. ""Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits."" The inverse of this is also true - increase friction between you and your bad habits! I think about this a lot when it comes to eating healthy. I need to reduce friction by having healthy food in the house and healthy snacks at work. And I need to increase friction by not having candy in the house or in my office! Out of sight, out of mind. In sight, and I eat it. :) (which of course reminds me of the Dad joke I often tell my girls: ""I'm on a seafood diet. I see food and I eat it...)

6. ""Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do."" This is a powerful concept. I put this in practice by only ""watching TV"" when I'm on the treadmill. I am able to run at a 6 MPH pace and watch TV or videos on the iPad when I'm on a treadmill. So, I generally only watch sporting events or movies or 80s music videos on YouTube when I'm running on the treadmill. This approach actually allows me to run longer if I want to watch a full half of a game, for example. And 80s music videos will often give me the energy to run that extra mile. :) Think about a new habit you want to start and how you can bundle it with an action you're already taking. Stack them together - i.e. habit stacking.

7. ""Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and 'don't break the chain.'"" Atomic Habits does a nice job of explaining the importance of tracking your habits for success. What gets measured gets managed. One of my favorite habit trackers is a FitBit/Apple Watch, which tracks steps, heart rate, sleep, weight and can even track food intake/calories, if you input this data. My behavior definitely changes thanks to these habit trackers. Atomic Habits gives you additional habit tracker resources.

8. ""Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately."" We all will have days where we fall off the bandwagon and our habits go in reverse. Well, that's okay for one day. Don't let it happen twice. Get back on track as soon as possible. (And, yes, sometimes we miss a habit two days in row. Just don't let it become three days...)

9. Author James Clear gets to the point quickly in Atomic Habits and with actionable advice. James has been blogging about habits, health, happiness, creativity and productivity since 2012. Check out a sampling of his writing at his website. James is also fun to follow on Twitter. Atomic Habits has 20 relatively short chapters that open with compelling stories and end with helpful chapter summaries. If you listen to books on Audible, I highly recommend the audio book as James reads this book very passionately.",positive
82,Books,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,$11.98,5,"If you imagine the structure of your life as a brick building, your habits are the bricks. They are the foundation that allow you to lead the life you desire, the life of your design. The reason habit formation is so important is because the conscious brain can only focus on one task at a time. Rote habits are carried out by the subconscious (or nonconscious) mind, and the more aspects of your daily life that you can pass off to your subconscious, the more mental bandwidth you have available to concentrate on other problems.

In his book, Clear lays out four laws that influence habit formation: Make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying. Each of these laws govern both our good habits and our bad habits, and they are the roadmap for change. For example, if we want to start exercising first thing in the morning, we can make it obvious by putting our running sneakers next to the bed the night before. For another example, if we are trying to quit a bad habit like smoking, we might make it difficult (the reverse of making it easy) by locking our cigarettes up in a place that is difficult to get to.

The two biggest cues that activate a habit are place and time. If you eat breakfast at the same time every morning, your body will learn to get hungry at that time. Similarly, if you always smoke cigarettes in your garage, when you go in there to do your laundry, your body will crave nicotine. This is because our “environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.” We often think that changing bad habits into good ones requires diligent will-power, and while this internal approach does sometimes work, it is not the only solution: sometimes changing the external environment that we are existing in can be just as impactful. This is because “our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.” If your relationship with your garage is that it is a quiet place where you go to smoke, then anytime you go there for any other reason, you will be triggered to smoke. You must change your relationship to your garage in order to curb the desire to smoke every time you enter.

The biggest misconception about habits is the difference between setting goals and building systems. “The purpose of setting goals is to win the game,” Clear writes, “the purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.” You might start a habit because you are motivated to do so, but you’ll stick with it because it becomes a part of your identity. It is the difference between saying to yourself “I am going to lay 100 bricks” and “I am going to be the best brick layer I can be.” Achieving a goal only changes your life momentarily, whereas adjusting your system changes your life forever. This is the purpose of creating strong and healthy habits: to improve your life one small brick at a time.

Reading this book led me to a personal revelation about my writing. When I first started writing book reviews, I set the goal of completing three a month. This inevitably became tiresome. Instead of remaining chained to this goal, I decided to change my mindset: Instead of writing three a month, I simply write as many as I can with the time that I have. I may have some months where I only produce one or two book reviews, but this will not take any wind out of my sails. My goal is no longer to write three reviews a month, but instead it is to be the best writer I can be. Reading and writing book reviews started off as something I was motivated to do because I wanted to share my favorite books with the world. Now it has become a part of my identity. I am a writer.

I humbly thank you for reading!",positive
83,Books,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,$11.98,5,"I’ve read several books on habits and this is by far the best. The author packs the book with lots of useful nuggets and methods around habit formation and change. His main thesis is that very small habits that help reinforce a strong identity will compound over time and lead to meaningful changes.

The author suggests that most people see habits as the necessary means to some specific goal or event, after which the habit may cease to be meaningful. He calls these “outcome-based” habits. However, instilling habits that resonate and fortify a personal identity, such as “athlete” or “health nut”, etc. are much more likely to stick and accumulate. These habits he calls “identity-based”.

He focuses on “systems” over “habits”. Systems drive behavior and beliefs drive systems. He talks about how our language often reflects our beliefs and how making small changes in how we describe ourselves can have outsized effects on our identity and behavior. Ex: A recently former smoker is offered a cigarette and says “no thanks, I’m trying to quit” reflects an identity that still sees themselves as a smoker as opposed to someone who may respond “No thanks, I’m not a smoker”.

The author introduces concepts such as “The Plateau of Latent Potential” and “The Valley of Disappointment” which describe the gap between expected short-term results and actual, delayed results. Early progress is often hard to measure and therefore often not obvious, when in fact changes are happening beneath the surface as your brain and body slowly rewire. This latent progress can demotivate us as our expectations often don’t match what we see or feel.

Like most other good books on habits, the author spends time explaining the ‘habit loop” process of Cue, Crave, Routine, and Reward. He emphasizes how architecting one’s environment to help reinforce positive cues is far more effective than relying on willpower and motivation. Our environment is the most powerful influencer of our habits.

The author also presents several examples of the power of just showing up. He calls this the “Two Minute Rule”. At the beginning of habit formation, what’s most important is simply showing up. Many people won’t start a new habit because they view the habit as being large and daunting. But reducing the new behavior to just 2-minutes, and only 2-minutes, can help ease you into the routine. Other concepts include Habit Stacking, Habit Tracking, and Accountability Partners.

Overall I found the book enlightening, engaging, and well written. If you’re looking to engineer a better life through habit change, Atomic Habits is a great resource.",positive

85,Books,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,$11.98,5,"I've read a lot of books on changing behavior and building habits and James Clear's Atomic Habits is my new favorite. This book is different from others in the way it covers an enormous amount of ground in the larger area of self-improvement while seamlessly tying all these ideas back into the central theme of habits.

One of the core concepts in Atomic Habits is to focus on the small improvement. The impact a 1% improvement per day can make may appear negligible at first, but Clear makes a compelling argument that in the case of habits, thinking small produces the biggest results over time. ""Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement,"" explains Clear.

Over the months and years, the accumulated effect of small habitual daily behaviors is staggering. Early in the book we are also warned that this compounding works both ways, so we'd better make sure we're making it work in the positive direction, not for the negative.

This is a concept I was introduced to years ago under a different name - Kaizen - the Japanese term for continuous incremental improvement. What's different and new in this book is how the concept is applied specifically to building habits.

I found the information introduced in chapter two about behavior change at the identity level to be spot-on. You're also given a simple two-step process for changing your identity and this one idea alone is incredibly powerful.

In chapter three, we are introduced to the habit loop - cue, craving, response, reward - and we learn how to build good habits in 4 simple steps and break bad habits in 4 simple steps.

One of those steps to habit formation, which goes hand in hand with the 1% concept, is how to make it not only small, but easy. In the chapters that follow, this is exactly what you find out.

Other ideas of great value that stood out included, habit stacking (the best way to form a new habit), habit tracking, habit shaping and how to design your environment - physical and social - for habit building success. You learn the truth about self-control, how to stop procrastinating and how to use implementation intentions, temptation bundling and motivational rituals. The book is simply packed with actionable ideas, tactics and strategies.

Virtually every idea in the book is useful and resonated with me. While I may not agree that we should ""forget about goals,"" I agree with one of Clear's core principles in the book - that we must develop systems for change. If we only focus on goals and don't develop systems and a focus on the process, we risk falling into a number of goal-related traps which ultimately lead to stagnation. With the right systems, we're rewarded with continuous improvement on a lifelong journey of success.

Another difference between Atomic Habits and other books in this genre is that while it's based on science it doesn't bog you down with unnecessary details of the research. Clear's book is intensely practical, giving you a huge toolkit of organized and named strategies you can apply immediately to create and strengthen positive habits and stop the negative ones.

The book is conversational, and includes many interesting stories, making it easy to read - and hard to put down (I read it cover to cover in one day).

It's possible this might become your most highlighted personal improvement book because every page is so chocked full of memorable and quotable gems of advice.",positive
86,Books,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,$11.98,5,"I began reading this book with very high expectations and it did not disappoint. I, myself, am a big believer of the power of habits and have done a lot of research on the topic. Yet I learned a lot, especially the clarity with which the author presents his ideas. Big parts of the book were, in some sense, confirmation that I was doing things the right way, since I was oftentimes thinking ""oh yeah, that's similar to what I'm doing"". Still, parts of the book and strategies proposed were new to me and really helped add habit strategies to my toolbox. As mentioned though, the best thing about this book is the clarity with which the ideas are presented and the way they blend together.

This quote from the last chapter summarizes the ""Four Laws of Behavior Change"" (that the book is about) well: "" (1) Sometimes a habit will be hard to remember and you'll need to make it obvious. (2) Other times you won't feel like starting and you'll need to make it attractive. (3) In many cases, you may find that a habit will be too difficult and you'll need to make it easy. (4) And sometimes, you won't feel like sticking with it and you'll need to make it satisfying.""

Here's some of the notes I made while reading the book:
- Habits are like compound interest in self-improvement.
- Outcomes are a lagging measure of habits.
- The ""Valley of Disappointment"" is the period where you are putting in the hard work but still seeing no results. --> but remember, your work is not being wasted, it is being stored.
- You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.
- Your habits shape your identity and your identity shapes your habit. It's a feedback loop. (reverse causation for the nerds here)
- Make clear plans - Use the ""Implementation Intention"": When X happens, then I will do Y OR if Z happens, then I will do W.
- Use ""Habit Stacking"": After behavior X, I will immediately perform behavior Y OR If Z happens, I will immediately perform behavior W. (i.e. As soon as I begin boiling water for tea, I will do 10 burpees). Also, be very clear. (i.e. I will do the burpees next to the fridge in the kitchen, or whatever, you get the idea. As long as it works, it's good!)
- People with high self-control are the ones who structure their environments in such a way to minimize exposure to tempting situations.
- Use ""Temptation Bundling"" + ""Habit Stacking"": After X, i will Y. Right after Y, I will immediately Z,
where X - habit I already do, Y - habit I need to do, Z - habit I want to do. (The anticipation of a reward is what gives us the most motivation - and not the reward itself.)
- Do something you enjoy before a difficult habit.
- Planning can sometimes be a form of procrastination because it can make you feel like you are making progress (while you are not).
- Make your habits as easy as possible to start (i.e. do one set of abs, read one page of my book) - This is called a ""Gateway Habit"". and it helps to reinforce your identity of who you are which will itself help motivate you to keep going.
- Prime your environment for future use - ""resetting your environment"" (i.e. Take out your coffee and mug the night before, make your bed perfectly, to remove the sense of sleep / bedroom if you'll be working from your bedroom)
- Use pre-commitment devices to make it harder/ impossible to deviate from good habits.
- Even one minute of a bad habit (i.e. checking instagram) can manifest into a lot (i.e. getting lost in time browsing instagram).
- Put some immediate reward into good habits / immediate punishment to bad habits.
- Create a habit tracker / calendar to provide a sense of accomplishment and motivation.
- Rule: Never miss a habit twice! (life gets in the way, but don't let it derail you off your path)
- Finding what you are naturally gifted in will make good habits easier. To do that ask the following questions. (1) What feels like fun to me but work to others? (2) What makes me lose track of time? (3) Where do I get greater returns than the average person? (4) What comes naturally to me?
- You can also win by being different, by rewriting the rules (i.e. by combining your unique set of skills)
- Periodic reflection and review can enable the long-term improvement of all habits - identity building.

Finally, some quotes I liked:
- ""Really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.""
- ""The greatest threat to success is not failure, but boredom.""
- ""You have to fall in love with boredom.""
- ""Improvement is not just about learning habits, it's also about fine-tuning them.""
- ""Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.""

And my favorite:
- ""It is remarkable what you can build if you just don't stop.""",positive

90,Books,Breaking History: A White House Memoir,$21.12,5,"Jared Kushner author’s this book… the same way he became way more than the President’s son-in-law. There’s a reason he became the President’s top adviser… on everything from how to maximize social media in planning untold strategies… to brokering multiple middle-east peace deals… that every other historical high ranking and leveraged figure never could! This young man is extremely straight forward… as well as intelligent. He knows when to say no and why… and unlike countless failed negotiators and Kings… Princes… Presidents… Vice-Presidents… et al… he knew when to ask questions… AND LISTEN… in situations that few others did.

This story of what it was truly like behind the scenes of Donald Trump’s election and time in office is laid out in such a smooth… intelligent… no-holds-barred format… that the four-hundred-fifty-plus-page book (plus pages of crisp clear color pictures… with interesting historical footnotes) will be read with the type of interest that will make you want to slow down and re-read a few passages as you go… to fully absorb accurately what you just learned… because as sure as I’m typing this review… you’re going to want to quote and discuss these “gems”… WITH FRIENDS AND FOES ALIKE!

The author… in my opinion makes a great decision on what he covers right off the bat. If a potential reader is not aware… his Father was convicted and sent to prison by then New Jersey U.S. Attorney Chris Christie. Jared’s family is extremely close and the years his Father was in prison obviously affected Jared for life… and is one of the reasons that along with the Middle East… prison reform and second chances were high on Kushner’s list right along with peace in the Middle-East. When Trump appointed Christie to head up his transition team… it was quite a dramatic moment in time when in a face to face meeting of all involved Trump said:

“SO, WE ARE GOOD THEN?

JARED REPLIED: “MY FATHER IS GOOD. BETWEEN CHRIS AND ME, IF WE’RE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER, I SHOULD EXPRESS THAT I FELT THE WAY YOU HANDLED MY FATHER’S CASE WAS OVERZEALOUS, AND IT BROUGHT SERIOUS HURT TO ME AND MY FAMILY.”

CHRISTIE EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD JUST BEEN DOING HIS JOB, THAT MY DAD HAD COMMITTED A CRIME, AND THAT IT WASN’T PERSONAL.

“WELL, RESPECTFULLY, I HAVE A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW ON THAT,” I SAID. IF IT WASN’T PERSONAL FOR YOU, THEN HOW COME YOU CHALLENGED MY FATHER’S RELEASE DATE AFTER HE HAD SERVED HIS SENTENCE? I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW BRUTAL IT IS FOR A FAMILY TO HAVE A LOVED ONE IN PRISON. THE ONLY SOLACE IS HAVING A DATE WHEN YOUR NIGHTMARE WILL END. WHEN THE PROSECUTOR COMES BACK AND CHALLENGES THE RELEASE DATE, AND IT GETS DELAYED INDEFINITELY, THAT’S DEVASTATING TO A FAMILY. SO DON’T TELL ME IT WASN’T PERSONAL, BECAUSE IF IT WASN’T PERSONAL, YOU WOULD HAVE LET HIM COME HOME ON TIME.”

“YOU KNOW, THE CRIME YOUR FATHER COMMITTED WAS TERRIBLE.” CHRISTIE STARTED TO SAY.

“THEN TRUMP INTERJECTED: “CHRIS, IT WAS A FAMILY DISPUTE.”

This is just a hint of the absolute “gloves-off-bare-knuckle” storytelling of recent political intrigue and… yes… HISTORY BREAKING! Calling a spade a spade as far as “leakers” and back stabbers such as…. Bannon… Tillerson… Priebus… Lewandowski… Manafort… and the total… spineless abandonment of Israel by the Obama administration… are laid out chapter and verse. Jared also makes the reader truly feel the stress and frustration of lives and political accomplishments put on hold or extremely weighed down by the disgusting phony Russian Collusion Hoax.

The author also shares and educates readers with his Grandparents escaping the Holocaust. The benefit of much of this early introductory narration… is that you can feel and start to understand not just what makes Jared tick… but what the whole of his soul… that he immerses into the opportunities he has to truly make the world a better place. Being that he always tried to stay in the background during the time he served our President and country… and was totally unlike ninety-five-per-cent of politicians who are “me-me-me”… and have ulterior motives… Jared like President Trump… didn’t need this job to earn money.

As someone who is constantly reading my entire life… a key to my enjoyment and my depth of education that I hope to get from each book I read… and how I rate them… is what I have come to call the “AUTHOR’S WRITING STYLE… HIS FLOW… AND… ARTISTIC SIGNATURE”. Unfortunately many authors have no real unique artistry… kind of like an orchestra without any instruments. I really enjoyed many things from Jared… one that I thought was “cute” and kind of endearing was the way… sometimes referring to Donald Trump…as… Trump… or… The President… or… my Father-In-Law… in natural ways based on the storytelling situation.

This is definitely not a “fake-news” kind of book… just trying to shock you… it truly comes across as a book that wants to educate you on the tumultuous period of time that it covers.",positive
91,Books,Breaking History: A White House Memoir,$21.12,4,"*Note – I do not let political opinions affect my reviews. I review books based on the content, not the political affiliations of the authors. It is my opinion that more people should read books written by current or former government officials, even if you don’t agree with them, because it helps to better understand their perspectives, and get more insight into what is actually happening behind the scenes.

This book has 59 main chapters, with a total of about 465 pages. At the end of the book, after the Acknowledgements, Notes, and Index, there is a Photos section with 32 pictures. There are some pictures of Kushner with his family, and many of him with world leaders from different countries.

Kushner starts the book with a Preface that explains some of his motivations for writing this memoir, and what he hopes readers will get from it. Then in the first chapter, he recalls a pivotal moment in his life when his father was arrested in 2004, after a bitter family feud had resulted in unexpected betrayals. This was a dramatic way to start a book, as Kushner’s father was facing charges of transporting a prostitute across state lines after trying to set up his brother-in-law…

Throughout the early chapters of the book, Kushner covers some of the big influences in his life. He talks about his grandparents surviving the Holocaust, his experiences at Harvard, and his challenges as a real estate investor navigating the crash of 2008. He describes how he met Ivanka, when her father suggested she meet with him to discuss potential real estate deals. The conversations that he recalls seem very realistic, as you can almost hear Trump’s voice saying these things. These early chapters set the tone, as Kushner certainly has a knack for telling an entertaining story.

Kushner continues to recall his experiences as he describes the Trump campaign, conflicts with Chris Christie (who had prosected Kushner’s father), early days of the Trump administration, and his family’s decision to leave their New York lives and move to DC to officially work in the administration. He describes conflicts with Steve Bannon, and early struggles with trying to manage important negotiations and Trump’s tweets at the same time. As the book goes on, Kushner covers his experiences with Trump and world leaders, while also including parts that describe his family life and personal thoughts. There are many different publicized events that you get to see from a slightly different perspective, as Kushner recalls conversations and interactions that were never made public.

Overall, I found this book to be informative, but also at times surprising and fascinating. I really enjoyed reading this more than I thought that I would, and it has certainly given me a slightly different perspective about Kushner, and some of the other people he mentions in the book. Again, I must stress that you do not have to agree with all of his politics to appreciate this window into the behind-the-scenes interactions at the highest levels of government. There are valuable insights here, and I hope that people can overcome the modern political tribalism and try to absorb the information provided by such a rare glimpse into this world.",positive
92,Books,Breaking History: A White House Memoir,$21.12,5,"Jared Kushner has done an exemplary job of detailing his experiences serving the people of the United States and his father-in-law, Donald Trump, former POTUS.

Kushner, like Trump, is a business man; successful in his own right. Drawn into political service by way of marriage to Ivanka, he learns the ropes of D. C. and participates in some of the most successful political accomplishments of the last 50+ years: Abraham Accords, USMCA, Operation Warpspead, Criminal Justice Reform, Border Wall and more.

Contrary to the biased blast proffered by the NYT, Kushner is forthcoming with regards to his shortcomings and his fears. He readily admits to being a novice and openly discusses how he went about learning to navigate the inner sanctums and long serving members of Congress. Kushner uses his skills from business and lessons learned from family and faith to craft an hardworking persevering presence that earned him accolades from foreign countries and brave domestic individuals. Jared doesn’t get all snarky and partisan in this book but he does give specifics on who in the administration was friend or foe; very enlightening.

Unlike other memoirs I’ve read recently, this one has the benefit of more intimate relationships with Trump and the family, for obvious reasons. Kushner doesn’t use his family status as a club to pave the way or wield power for himself. It’s a driving force behind his ardent motivation and the level of insight that we readers are afforded in this engaging, conversational volume.

If you’re interested in greater details about the Middle East peace negotiations or the trade agreement between the USA, Mexico & Canada, this is a good read for you. There’s no politicking and no slandering and even the language is clean. Kushner served with his whole heart and soul, along with his wife, Ivanka. A worthy read; were I younger, I’d be inspired to political service📚",positive
93,Books,Breaking History: A White House Memoir,$21.12,5,"Like everyone else I was always very curious to know exactly what the family went through in the four years they were in the White House. I think Mr. Kushner wrote an amazing account of his experience not only in the White House but his life experiences which helped him very much navigate what is probably one of the most backstabbing, toxic environment a person could be in. I hope everyone enjoys this book as much as I have and gets a chance to see another side into this presidency…one that has been hindered since the day it began. We as Americans should demand the media and our government to provide us the truth, for so long it has been so dishonest that it has caused the division that we live in. Thank you for such an insightful look into what we on the outside will never understand. It wasn’t easy!!!",positive
94,Books,Breaking History: A White House Memoir,$21.12,5,"As a CPA who likes to know what goes on behind the scene, I found this book to be an outstanding demonstration of what a family can do for our country if they put personal ambitions aside and focus on what can be accomplished. The contrast between the Trump administration and the current administration stand in stark contrast.

I would expect this type of book to emphasize the good that has been done and not tear into the president Trump. In meeting this expectation it also confirms my belief that what Trump Twittered many time were part of a negotiating strategy not random thoughts. Thanks for sharing your insights to all of us.",positive
95,Books,Breaking History: A White House Memoir,$21.12,3,"I’ve never been a fan of Donald Trump or his presidency. Nevertheless, I came to ""Breaking History"" with an open mind. More than a third of the way through this 465-page political memoir that is clearly stated and easy to read, my reaction is decidedly mixed.

On the one hand, readers looking for an objective treatment of the Trump presidency, or Mr. Kushner’s performance as a Presidential advisor, will not find it here. After all, Mr. Kushner is Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, married to his daughter Ivanka. He can be expected to attempt to cast himself, his wife, and President Trump and his administration in the best possible light—which he does. But he does it to such an extent that he often comes off as disingenuous.

In sum, we’re asked to believe that all three were merely unselfish, patriotic, rational all-Americans committed to fighting a cruel and corrupt Washington, D.C. culture that long ago forgot the American people in their rush to embrace globalism. In pushing this theme, Mr. Kushner glosses over a lot and fails, in many instances, to give the full context of the events he describes. In fact, he glosses over so much that, at times, I wondered if I wasn’t reading “The Cliff Notes” on the Trump 2016 campaign and ensuing presidency.

On the other hand, there are some interesting facets to this book. For example, I found his recount of the recent history of the Middle East and the administration’s attempts to forge peace between Israel and various Arab states somewhat informative. In other words, I thought I learned something—at least enough to know that I probably need to learn more and should read further.

I found his treatment of various co-workers inside the Trump White House—especially Steve Bannon and former Chiefs of Staff Reince Priebus and John Kelly—revealing. I wasn’t aware that Mr. Kushner was responsible for hiring Mr. Bannon—somewhat ironic considering Mr. Bannon’s alleged attempts to have Mr. Kushner removed from the White House staff. And then there was the incident involving John Kelly and the downgrade of Mr. Kushner’s security clearance. In any event, it seems that the culture inside the White House was just as cruel, vindictive, and self-serving as the supposed D.C. culture it fought against. Talk about a “team of rivals.”

And I thought it important that Mr. Kushner discussed what he found to be his, and the administration’s accomplishments, especially in the areas of NAFTA, criminal justice reform, Middle East Peace, and COVID.

I haven’t learned all that much about Mr. Trump, yet (although I did find Mr. Kushner’s attempts to equate him with Theodore Roosevelt somewhat “over the top.”) Probably, the most telling thing Mr. Kushner says about the former President is that he cared “more about results than process.” That may be a great way to operate when running a family business. But we’re supposed to be a “nation of laws and not of men.” Our laws set forth and define the processes that govern us. For a president to be less interested in process than the result would seem to set a dangerous, destabilizing precedent.

As I said at the beginning, my reaction is decidedly mixed.",fair
96,Books,Breaking History: A White House Memoir,$21.12,5,"Everyone should read Jared’s book if they are interested in learning about how the administration managed its’ priorities and the barrage of scrutiny they received. Trump accomplished some amazing things in spite of the utter disorganization in his administration and undermining that was taking place throughout his Presidency. Jared and Ivanka were key players in helping get bipartisan criminal justice reform signed into law, tax cuts achieved, the Covid response and peace in the Middle East between several Arab countries with Israel. This book details each major event and walks you through what was happening throughout the process. I couldn’t put it down, received the book on Tuesday evening and finished on Thursday evening.

I have completed only the first three chapters, but I want to shower the Goodreads world with this premature review to counter all of the jealous and hateful commentary that already exists in this forum. Mr. Kushner, in the first few pages of his spectacular memoir, paints an honest, caring, hardworking portrait of his family and of the Trumps. I am so very excited to finally learn of Mr. Kushner's background, and I am delighted that true to form, the Trumps (namely Ivanka) selected high quality stock for their dynasty.

100,Books,November 9: A Novel,$11.44,5,"THE STORY:
Becca : After each CoHo novel that I read, I have a moment of reflection immediately after finishing. I need the time to think about the story from start to finish, every moment that broke my heart and every moment that put it back together. It is no surprise that November 9 gave me all the feels of each CoHo book before it. Even a week after finishing it I still am reeling from all of the emotions!

emotions

Fallon (love that name!) has big plans to move from LA across the country to NYC, on the day she is scheduled to move she meets Ben and the two form an instant connection. They spend her last day in LA together and she learns that Ben is in college and wants to be a writer. After meeting Fallon, Ben finally has something to write about. After their one amazing day together, they go on to lead separate lives, but meet up every year on the same day (yup you guessed - November 9th :) in the same place. Until Fallon learns some things about Ben and begins to question what is real and what is Fiction.

“You’ll never be able to find yourself if you’re lost in someone else.”

Lisa : Just like Becca, I'm a HUGE CoHo fan. And though her books aren't necessary ""perfect"" and without issue, they always bring out the feels. ALL the feels! Her emotional stories combined with her deep and complex characters never disappoint.

Fallon suffered a traumatic event that left her scarred both inside and out. Her lack of family support in LA is helping to encourage her move to NYC where she is hoping to tackle her dream of being a movie star. She didn't expect to meet Ben, and she definitely didn't expect to feel what she felt for him after only spending those few hours together. But their connection was undeniable, which brought about their November 9 pact. I'm such a sucker for romantic-comedies, so the thought of this left me all kinds of giggly inside.

giddy

THE CHARACTERS:
Lisa : Fallon and Ben's story was impossible not to love. Their relationship from the start was filled with witty banter, emotions, and the realness we all hope for in romance stories. Neither character was perfect, both holding back on sharing their secrets with the other. And trust me... they had secrets! But the chemistry and bond between the two was undeniable! Even after a year without seeing each other, the November 9 meetups were so powerful and filled with emotion, humor and, of course, love.

“When you find love, you take it. You grab it with both hands and you do everything in your power not to let it go. You can’t just walk away from it and expect it to linger until you’re ready for it.”

Fallon was such a strong person, yet after suffering such a horrific event she was left stuck inside her shell, unable to truly be herself any longer. She also didn't have the support system she so needed while going through this time in her life. Thank goodness for her BFF, who helped her get through each day.

Ben was a bit of an enigma for most of the story. He was definitely hiding things, but not knowing what they were kept me at arm's length. I loved how powerful he felt about Fallon, and how he wasn't afraid to show his interest in her from the start. I also liked how headstrong, determined and forgiving he was. Overall, an extremely swoon-worthy guy in my opinion!

Becca : I felt the same as Lisa about Ben, I liked him a lot but could definitely tell that he was holding something back. I really kept wondering what he was hiding, especially when we meet his family and they know all about this past that the reader doesn't. Despite that, I still loved Ben! He was so positive and he seemed to help Fallon in ways that no one else could. He was so encouraging and praising of her, it really was beautiful. I think that everyone of us would love someone to tell us all of the amazing things abut ourselves that we don't see :)

“A body is simply a package for the true gifts inside. And you are full of gifts. Selflessness, kindness, compassion. All the things that matter. Youth and beauty fade. Human decency doesn't.”

I really liked Fallon, in the moments when she let her guard down you could see what a positive and energetic person she was. It was sad that after the tragic event from her past. she hid that person away. I loved how much she grew throughout the novel, getting stronger and more confident. I think that Ben played a part in that, but she did most of it herself!

The secondary characters really helped me to understand both Ben and Fallon. Ben's older brothers and Fallon's Mother, Father and Bestie really helped build this story for me more. Also, Ben's Mother was the one who really helped me to understand him. Each of these played such an important role in this story.

OVERALL:
Becca : Was this book perfect? No not exactly, I had a couple of issues here and there, and it's hard to reveal them without spoiling the story. As a matter of fact, it is very hard to discuss this entire book and not spoil anything. I will say that you definitely have to experience this for yourself and try to go in as blind a possible.

“I need you to know that it was always you who had my heart. And I would have never let anyone else borrow it if I knew there was a chance in hell you’d ever want it back.""

Throughout the first half of the book, I was just grinning and smiling and loving the banter and connection between Fallon and Ben. Then all of a sudden BAM!! CoHo does what CoHo does best and throws you a curve ball that you did not see coming! I LOVED it! I cried... and cried... and cried some more. I kept texting Lisa... OMG did you get to ___%?! And she would be like ""almost there!"" Then she would get there and we would both be like ""OMG! OMG! OMG!"" It was intense and I felt like I was on a roller coaster!

As a matter of fact here is one of my status updates on Good Reads: ""OMG! WTF! Holy friggin $hit!!""

glas case

I will always be a huge fan of Colleen Hoover, she is absolutely amazing and can make me think and feel in ways that I never have before. Each of her characters finds a place in my heart and when I think of my favorite books and characters, hers often top my list. She builds characters that are flawed but lovable and forever memorable. I was so excited to get an advanced ARC of this, but I also pre-ordered a physical copy too because I knew this was one I needed on my shelf! If you are fan of CoHo, or even if you are not read this! You will probably cry, but it is worth it and you will definitely be smiling at the end... or maybe even silly giggling ;)

Lisa : There was one little thing that kept me from giving this a full five stars, but I honestly can't discuss that without it being a huge spoiler. So let's just say there was something that I kind of wish was done differently, but it didn't really take away from the story too much for me. Colleen Hoover has this way of sucking you in and holding your heart in the palm of her hands for the entirety of the story. There's a reason she is so loved in the book world... she's a pure writing mastermind and can capture us all in the matter of mere pages.

101,Books,November 9: A Novel,$11.44,5,"Loved this book! Love how it began by explaining how November 9 was a hard day for Fallon because it’s the anniversary of the day a fire almost took her life. That fire left scars all over her body that took away her self confidence. On one November 9, Fallon meets up with her dad at a diner to eat, where she meets a guy named Ben. They immediately hit it off, as he is the first to make her truly feel beautiful, scars and all. However, Fallon is set to move to New York the next day, and her mother always told her that a woman finds herself between the ages of 18-23, so to basically not settle down during those ages. So, Fallon and Ben agree to meet up every November 9 for the next 5 years. They are to have no other contact throughout the year until this day. Well they meet up each year, and things happen in their lives that cause turmoil. One November 9, Fallon discovers Ben’s manuscript and starts reading it and reads that Ben was responsible for the fire that almost took her life. This was huge, because up until now, she thought her father was responsible for it. She ends up reading more of his manuscript and realizes he set the fire for pure reasons. Ben’s mom committed suicide when he was 16. He had no suspicions for her to do this, so he starts checking her phone and he blames it on Fallon’s father since they had been having frequent conversations. When he gets to Fallon’s fathers house, he’s cleaning his prized car, seemingly unfazed by the news that his lover has died. This pissed Ben off so he wants to burn what he loves the most, his car. However, it ends up catching the house on fire, where Fallon was unbeknownst to him. She ends up forgiving him though and they live happily ever after. Such a sweet story.",positive
102,Books,November 9: A Novel,$11.44,5,"I am officially a Colleen Hoover addict. Her writing touches my soul. I've never read a book of hers where I didn't end up a complete sobbing wreck at least once.

Colleen's writing style, her ability to suck the reader in from the jump, to bring characters to life in settings and situations based in a reality in which you FEEL that you are a part of it, that you aren't reading fiction but the biography is the most astounding gift a writer can possess.

This story is reminiscent of Same Time Next Year with vibes of When Harry Met Sally, and yet soooo much more profound.

November 9 makes you believe in soulmates, in selfless love, in the power guilt can hold over someone's life, and the greater power that forgiveness has to free a soul. Ben and Fallon are true fated souls, always destined to play a role in each other's lives, and anything else I could say would ruin the experience for the reader.

I know I say it every time I read one of her books, but beautiful tragedy and tragically beautiful are synonymous with every Colleen Hoover story. NO ONE can ever touch her in this category.

As a reader, all I can say is thank you. I hope you take me on these journeys for years to come. ❤",positive
103,Books,November 9: A Novel,$11.44,5,"“Go easy on me, Fallon. My heart is fragile.”

I’m right there with you Ben, my heart is fragile too and Colleen Hoover (in true CoHo fashion) did a number on it in this book! I had butterflies, I laughed, I got angry, I got teary-eyed, you name it and it probably happened to me in this book. It’s always a treat to read a Colleen Hoover book, it’s like Christmas when she releases something new! And what a gift this book was, from the unique concept to the engaging characters and the rock-solid writing it was such fun to read (even when she was stomping all over my heart) from start to finish! This is definitely in my top 5 books I’ve read this year.

The concept of this book was so awesome and so unique! Ben and Fallon meet one November 9th when they are both 18, and let me tell you, their first meeting was so cute and will make you instantly fall in love with Ben’s character. They hit it off immediately and end up spending the rest of the day together, it seems like the start of a wonderful relationship. One minor hitch though, Fallon happens to be moving across country that night to try to start over (I won’t spoil anything but due to some unfortunate circumstances her young acting career was cut short). And upon the sage advice from her mother she is determined to not fall in love until she’s found herself first (which according to her mom can’t happen until she’s 23). So while she is appreciative of Ben and all he did for her in the short time they’ve known each other, she is set to part ways from him and start her new life. Desperate to think of some way to see her again, Ben (who happens to be a writer) proposes an ingenious idea:

“What if we meet up again next year on the same day? And the year after that? We’ll do it for five years. Same date, same time, same place. We’ll pick up where we left off tonight, but only for the day. I’ll make sure you’re following through with your auditions and I can write a book about the days we’re together.”

Fallon agrees and they both depart with their ‘homework’ for the year to come. From there we basically we follow Ben and Fallon over the years as they meet up again each November 9th. Part of their agreement is that they are to have no contact with each other aside from that one day and they are encouraged to go out and live their lives during that time. This idea totally fascinated me and I thought it was a brilliant concept. It kept me on the edge of my seat as each new November 9th came around because as a reader we also have no contact with Ben or Fallon during this time. Everything we learn about what happened in the prior year we learn on November 9th along with them. Considering there was a 1-year time jump every few chapters, I didn’t feel like I missed anything, much like them I lived for the ‘next’ November 9th to see what was going to happen (only lucky for us, all we had to do was turn the page to get to the next year, rather than waiting a full year like Ben and Fallon did!). I was always wondering if this was going to be the time where everything fell apart. And as the years go by, you see their connection continue to evolve and how hard it is to part ways again, as a reader it was also hard to say ‘goodbye’ for another ‘year’ when their time was up! And in certain years your heart is going to break and in others it will rejoice. There’s no shortage of feels in this book, that’s for sure!

“For one day each year, I wanted to be this guy who was falling for this girl, because everything about you captivated me.”

As with all of Colleen Hoover’s books, you’re going to fall hard for her characters, both separately and for them as a couple. She just has this amazing ability to make her characters seem so real and full of life, they jump off the page and are people that you totally want to be friends with. This was definitely the case here, as I said earlier I fell in love with Ben right from the start and while there were a few things I got upset with him about, I loved how Colleen Hoover tied everything together so that by the end you still love him. Fallon was also an awesome heroine, I love how she evolved from the self-conscience girl we first met to the strong, confident woman we know by the end. And I loved, loved, loved Fallon and Ben together. Their chemistry was amazing and their quirky little conversations and inside jokes were just pure gold. It was awesome that Fallon was a fan of romance books, that right there instantly bonded me to her and her and Ben’s book conversations were priceless! Any book lover will get a kick out of those little nuggets.

Oh and randomly, there is an easter egg hidden in this book for fans of one of her other books. I won’t say what it is, but I was delighted when I made the connection! It was unexpected but a welcome surprise!

Colleen Hoover is the master of plot twists and there are no shortage of jaw dropping twists in this book. There was one that I saw coming and I thought for sure that was going to be the big one but then she drops another bomb on us that made my eyes bulge out of my head! I had certain suspicions but I did not expect that to happen at all! But I love that about her books, you definitely have to expect the unexpected and even then you’ll probably never see it coming. It really is mind boggling how she can so perfectly weave these stories together, I would seriously recommend a Colleen Hoover book to anyone, they are in a league of their own and I know I’ll always be anxiously awaiting her next masterpiece!

‘I laugh, relieved that she’s… that she simply exists. And that we were lucky enough to exist in the same lifetime, in the same area of the world, in the same state. And that, after all these years, I surprisingly wouldn’t change a single thing about what ultimately brought us together.’

Sigh…. (and yes, for those that read the book, I just said ‘sigh’ instead of actually sighing.)",positive

Stunning. Consuming. Poetic. Raw. Heartrendingly Beautiful. These are a few words that comes to mind when describing this magnificent and captivating masterpiece called November 9 by Colleen Hoover. CoHo is one of those rare authors who DELIVERS every single time. If her mission was to grip her readers hearts and leave a stain on our soul with her written words then I will happily say mission accomplished. She delivered. Well, she more than DELIVERED as readers like myself happily handed my heart to her as she took me on one of the most unforgettable reads that I have read.

One date. November 9. One day out of 365 days in the year. That one specific date that CoHo has ingrained in her readers. The date that readers like myself will fall in love with the story of Benton James Kessler and Fallon O'Neill. November 9.

“ I'm in love with her. Like really in love with her. Crippling, debilitating, paralyzing love.”

In life, there are so many momentousness occasions and life-altering dates that occurs in one's life whether it be a birthday, a milestone, a graduation, a wedding, a death anniversary, or the day that will forever alter and change your life. For Fallon O'Neill, November 9 marked the day that changed her. It is the day that left her insecure and ridden with physical scars. But on that specific day, November 9 also marked the date that she met Benton James Kessler.

On November 9, Benton James Kessler walked into Fallon O' Neill's life and instantly knew his life would be forever altered by this girl. He didn't see a young woman with physical scars but instead saw a witty, smart, funny and beautiful girl. A girl who just needed that extra push of encouragement to be bold and confident. He saw that her inner beauty radiated from within and that her scars were just as beautiful. It told him that this girl he just met was a fighter and survivor.

“Maybe I don't know the first thing about falling in love, because I've been telling myself I'm not falling for him yet. That it's too soon. But it's not. What's happening inside my heart right now is way too consequential to deny. I think I've been misjudging the whole concept of insta-love. Now if I can just figure out how we can finish these next few years with a happy ending.”

They say ever scar tells a story. And for Fallon, her scars tells of a story that will emotionally gut you. Her scars were a reminder of a terrible accident gone wrong and a resentment she holds. These scares were put on display of what could have been a thriving career as a young actress in Hollywood. But all that changes, when Ben made her see that she doesn't have to hide her scars. Ben knocked down her walls of insecurities and stripped her bare, allowing her to see that Fallon O'Neill is one of the most beautiful woman that walked into his life. And on that day, November 9 marked the day when a boy fell in love with a girl. The day that gave birth to an epic love story.

“No combination of written words could ever do this moment justice.”

I really don't want to say anymore because November 9 is a book that must be read, experienced and savored. I will just say this Colleen Hoover reminded me once again why I love reading her books. She has a way of stripping you down, laying you bare and exposed in order to FEEL for her characters. Passion, strength, humor, hope, absolution, and love were so beautifully entangled and woven into this book that I was left breathless as I absorb every written word and emotion. Did Colleen Hoover leave me a blubbering mess? Yes, of course she did. She is Colleen Hoover, a master in pulling those emotional heartstrings. With that being said, I will just say CoHo will shatter your hearts as she weaves one of the most emotional plot twist that will have you grabbing for the tissues. But don't worry and fret too long, CoHo will heal and mend our broken hearts with her magical and book-worthy unforgettable lines. Just be prepared to fall in love Benton James Kessler as he writes and tells us why his love for Fallon O'Neill is book-worthy.

“I don't want to be your first, Fallon. I want to be your last.”

Colleen Hoover is one those gifted and rare writers who can capture your hearts with her gorgeous prose and raw characters. Like any masterpiece, Colleen Hoover paints a beautiful literary creation that will leave a lasting impression that can stain your soul. Her words are not only felt but absorbed. It is often said to let the work speak for itself and as such Colleen Hoover will hold you hostage as you are immersed with beauty, loss, friendship, heartache, and a new found sense of hope, absolution, finding oneself, and an epic book-worthy love. November 9 was a book that consumed you, stripped you naked and left you feeling raw, exposed and vulnerable and it was worth every laughter, tears, and swoon-worthy moments. As an avid reader, I love to read book to escape. To fall in love with the words, the characters, and everything in between. Just a few pages in, you can already tell if a book is going to be amazing or not. And let me just say, November Nine is 100% BOOK WORTHY!!!!! So thank you, Colleen Hoover, for gifting your readers on another unforgettable book worthy romance!!!!

110,Books,"The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma",$11.40,5,"Of all the non-fiction books I've read, this is by far the best one ever. I grew up in a tough way. Lots went wrong. My brother and I believed we were unwanted and we had plenty of evidence to back up our sentiment. We suffered shared abuse and individual abuses of every kind imaginable. When I became an adult, I subscribe to the concepts of people like Rush Limbaugh and drove around listening to his radio show proclaiming that there is no such thing as post-traumatic stress disorder. I believed I could gut it out, that the past was the past and that only weak people needed to talk through their problems. I believed only losers behaved badly as adults due to anything in their childhood or past and that claiming you were affected by any past problem was a crutch to allow you to embrace failure. Frankly, for a time, that approach worked for me. I got married, had some great children (still have them thankfully), built a company. But it didn't take too long until it all came crashing down. And, when it did, I spent nearly 1.5 decades down. The anxiety that was always in my throat and chest was, to put it mildly, a distraction. It's very hard to be kind to people, to focus on your work, to love others when all your power is spent trying to pretend you don't feel like s***. When you can't sleep because your heart is beating so forcefully that the entire bed is vibrating - at least it feels that way - you not only lose the joy of sleep, but you feel hopeless and miserable and even more so when you're not able to understand why you feel this way. When you see everything you have go away and can only occasionally find the strength to take care of yourself and your business and need others in your life to carry you from time to time (much to your embarrassment) and yet you think you're smart and capable and have no understanding of why you are where you are, life becomes a slog. You trudge through it wishing you were dead or that something would kill you even if, like me, you'd never kill yourself. Literally, when I was a believer, I went to bed every night and my prayers went something like this, ""Dear Jesus, please have a bus run over me. I will never kill myself but I'm miserable. Please let me die so my family won't hate me for killing myself but so that I can stop hating the sun coming up. In Jesus name, Amen."" If you're like I was (and it's hard to tell you how I was and hold the tears down even now), this book will help you change all that. It will describe in detail what you're going through and it captures so many of those subtleties as to make it absolutely amazing. For the first time, I don't have depression (and I don't take pills). I don't have anxiety (it still bubbles up on occasion but using mindfulness, it goes nearly as fast as it comes). My life is pointed in the right direction, my business future is hopeful, my love-life is stabilizing, I know I'll no longer lose friends. I'm finally on track to getting what I want in every area of my life from women to money to friends and deep connections with my family. While I can't attribute every part of my success to this book alone as it takes many things to get where you want to go (mostly you), I can absolutely attest to the power of this book. If you've suffered any sort of major and/or persistent trauma in your life, please buy (and read) this book. You will one day thank yourself for doing so.",positive
111,Books,"The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma",$11.40,5,"Psychiatrist, professor, world-class researcher, and traumatologist Bessel van der Kolk MD requires no introduction to trauma psychotherapists. My enduring impressions of him over many years is one of relevance, cogency, frankness, and accessibility - served up with a subtle dash of impishness. He tends to be a bit disruptive - something of a provocateur - and everything of his I have ever read has taught me something, confirmed something important, or pushed my thinking in a new direction. When he has something to say, I want to hear it.

However, I almost didn't buy this book: I was put off by the title. Familiar with major reviews of PTSD psychotherapy outcomes research, I know that research support for body-oriented approaches to treating psychological trauma psychopathology is thin at best, and such treatment models simply do not have the research validation of either EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) and PE (Prolonged Exposure), neither of which are especially body-focused.

J. Interlandi's excellent article anticipating publication of this book - ""A Revolutionary Approach to Treating PTSD"" (New York Times Magazine, 2014.05.22 - available online) - initially supported my fears that for some inexplicable reason van der Kolk was now promoting some treatment model for which we have little confirming research. ""Psychomotor therapy is neither widely practiced nor supported by clinical studies,"" Interlandi informs us. Provocateur he may be, but I'm strongly biased in favor of paying attention to therapies for which we do have solid empirical validation. Our clients do not deserve to be experimental subjects - maybe not even if they agree to this, as I'm not sure they can ever know enough to make a truly informed consent. Knowledge that PTSD and related disorders are usually highly curable, when using the right treatment protocols, sadly remains the possession of a minority of people, even in the professional psychotherapy world.

Yet the account of van der Kolk's therapy work in Interlandi's article is gripping. Becoming completely absorbed in the account, I was convinced. (I've been here before, reading van der Kolk's own accounts of his work.) And so the disruption begins! Deeper into the article, he has me. Van der Kolk's critique of CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy - a general class of therapies) and PE (E. Foa's exposure therapy model) is withering and correct: neither really work. ""Trauma has nothing whatsoever to do with cognition...It has to do with your body being reset to interpret the world as a dangerous place....It's not something you can talk yourself out of."" Interlandi reports that ""That view places him on the fringes of the psychiatric mainstream.""

But he's right, and I can't stress this enough. Why? Because as a trauma treatment professional I'm well aware of what the trauma treatment outcomes research actually says. The best current summary of this research well may be chapter 2 of Ecker, et al.'s (2012) ""Unlocking the emotional brain"". (Buy this book, too!) Ecker et al. brilliantly presents a synthetic summary that encompasses 11 existing therapy models which actually DO cure trauma psychopathology, if done right. In this context, what van der Kolk is doing makes perfect sense. Finally, it appears, the trauma psychotherapy field is moving toward a consensus which has strong credibility.

Van der Kolk's new book has many virtues. Parts One and Two (102 pp) provide a substantial review of the neuropsychology of trauma's impact on a person. It's fun, interesting, informative reading, for professional and layperson alike. Part Three (64 pp) surveys childhood development, attachment experience, and ""the hidden epidemic of developmental trauma"". Van der Kolk has for years been a leading champion of the idea that there is a type of PTSD which substantially differs from all the rest. It develops in response to chronic child abuse and/or neglect. I completely share his belief that the diagnosis of Developmental Trauma Disorder (sometimes called C-PTSD, with ""C"" meaning ""Complex"") is overdue for formal recognition. I find his review of the struggle to legitimize DTD as gripping and distressing as anything else in the book. It is anguishing to know that a major problem exists, AND that the psychiatric establishment simply refuses to acknowledge it. DTD/C-PTSD is no fantasy. We see and treat these people, as children and adults. They exist, and they are nothing like ""ordinary"" PTSD treatment clients.

Part Four (29 pp) focuses on memory. I've long thought that much writing on treating psychological trauma seems to miss the point: trauma memory is what causes the problem. Deal with that and the symptoms vanish. Why is this so hard to understand? Yet, it is not a common understanding at all. Explaining how trauma memory works is invariably enlightening to my clients. And experiencing what happens when we change the nature of trauma memory is revelatory to someone who's lived with it for years, if not decades. As he does throughout the book, van der Kolk offers fine stories about clients who have experienced exactly what I've seen happen in my clients, making excellent use of what cognitive research tells us: people understand things best through narratives. Offer a good narrative and you convince.

Psychological trauma therapy is complex, but we are now well prepared to launch into the book's core content - Part Five (154 pp), ""Paths to Recovery"". He gets right to it: we cannot undo the trauma, but we CAN undo its effect on us, and so get our ""self"" back. Ch. 13 reviews existing therapies. His approach is to repair ""Descartes' Error"" (see Damásio's 1994 book of that title) by viewing mind and body as a single coherent functional unit. His topical coverage is complete and his critique of current therapies acute - not to be missed.

He then writes of the importance of language (Ch. 14). We construct our narrative mainly in words, and the words we choose are critical. But language is not enough (this anticipates his next two chapters). Our senses encompass a larger world, and it's center is our body, where all our sensory receptors are located. Then he introduces the treatment model he's long advocated: EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). I'm trained in EMDR, and in fact van der Kolk and I had the same instructor for our advanced training: Gerald Puk PhD. Van der Kolk tells an amusing and self-deprecating story about his advanced training experience, in which Puk was able to provide a strong corrective to his approach to clients. This is typical van der Kolk - he's a truth-teller, even when it may put him in a poor light! And,after all, at this point he has nothing to prove to anyone.

Finding an EMDR therapist is not hard (see his ""Resources"" section). Nor is it hard to find a yoga instructor, and yoga is what he advises for helping a trauma victim get back into their body. Yoga is a wise choice, because it is available, already widely known, and adaptable to a wide range of individuals and capabilities.

There is much more in Part Five, and the focus is on self-empowerment. ""Victim no more!"" as they say. Most trauma therapists have a keen interest in seeing their clients leave therapy charged up and ready to fully embrace their life - that certainly is my own emphasis. Van der Kolk's thoughts on self-empowerment for those in recovery from psychological trauma will be invaluable to any trauma psychotherapy client.

For psychotherapy professionals, this book will be both delightful and confirming. For everyone else, it will be a readable, gripping, highly educational tour of topics all of which are critical to a successful transition back from the impact of psychological trauma. That he gives prominent though not dominating emphasis to developmental trauma disorders is entirely appropriate. Our society has yet to grasp that child abuse and neglect is a more often chronic than not, and that its impact is largely ignored and poorly treated, if at all. This does not have to be. Get educated (this book will do that), then commit to being an advocate for children as well as for adults impacted by trauma. They all deserve the chance to be healed, and we can now do that. Van der Kolk shows us how.

It was widely known then that diagnosing a person’s mental states was not as precise as diagnosing a broken leg. Fast forward just three decades later, and that humility as transformed into hubris. The language of the DSM has permeated every facet of our culture with a kind of religious authority: This person is a narcissist; that one is bi-polar. Informal diagnoses abound, as pop psychology articles on the Internet aid and abet an army of armchair psychologists. Professional practice fairs little better: Most talk therapy, regardless of it’s flavor, rarely gets to the heart, or more precisely, the body of the matter.

When six months of discussion one hour a week doesn’t yield results, the next action is usually a diagnosis, the treatment of which requires a pharmacological solution. The drugs often do not work, and in the case of SSRIs among others, these medicinal interventions have been shown to be outright harmful to the patient. Big pharma’s profits soar, and the patients remain unwell or worse than when they started treatment.

In this environment, Van der Kolk’s work is needed now more than ever. Many of the DSM diagnoses are various flavors of how trauma is manifesting itself in the patient. Trauma is not stored in the linguistic parts of the brain and body, and it therefore must be treated by means others than the linguistic talk-therapy approaches, and not masked with drugs. Van der Kolk takes readers on an exploration of a new landscape of treatment that involves yoga, dance, meditation, and theater, right along with EMDR and neurofeedback, among other newly-researched treatments.

114,Books,"The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma",$11.40,4,"I want to give this book 3.5 stars, but because I think the knowledge in this book is important for the average person to read, I’ll give it 4 stars. I want to preface that the epilogue to this book (“Choices to be Made”) is an absolute trash-ridden, garage-filled piece of detritus that doesn’t belong anywhere in any sort of literature. It almost convinced me that this author is an absolute shill. However, if one ignores that entire last chapter, then the book itself is actually quite superb (and the author doesn’t seem to be a fraud).

Trauma is a huge problem in the world. Many subjects in the modern era have really advanced in order to better understand the human brain, mind, and the processes connecting them (mainly due to technological advancements such as the fMRI). I would think that to most people, trauma is something that can detrimentally, and sometimes irreversibly, harm someone. If that someone is a child, this damage is multiplied by a billion. However, what I think that people end up lacking is the knowledge of when/how trauma can form. It isn’t just caused by obvious phenomena such as war, natural disasters, tragic family accidents. It can be caused by simple things as well such as verbal arguments, falling off a bike as a child, or a parent working long hours and never seeing his or her child. This is why this book is important. It makes it known that trauma is a lot (or can be a lot) more ubiquitous than people think.

The book is broken down into a few sections. I would say about 70% of this book is background, on a variety of subject matter. This certainly could have been shortened down by about 40%, but I suppose more information is generally better (in this case I would likely disagree, as the book itself is already too long, so removing the “fluff” would likely have been a good idea). The last 30% of the book is about “solutions” to trauma. I won’t go into each chapter and mention every main point, but overall each chapter is worth, at the very least, a heavy skim

The background knowledge on trauma is really interesting. We learn what parts of the brain are activated during trauma (and parts that are activated post-trauma). This help us to understand why people may “freeze” during a traumatic experience, why people cant express their feelings when they become “triggered”, and why certain medications work better than others. The information here really opened my eyes as to why people who have experienced trauma can act so strangely and illogically. “Just tell me what emotion you are feeling.” “Stop trying to hit me! What the hell do you think you’re doing?” I feel like I can sympathize more with these people and have a better understanding of how to approach them.

The solutions to this were quite impressive and honestly seemed fairly simple in nature. Examples include EMDR (which is essentially just a mixture of hypnosis and REM sleep initiation), brain-computer interface technology to control frequencies produced by your brain, talking, yoga, theater, etc. There is no cure-all method, but rather each solution needs to be tailored to each individual. Obviously, drugs are an option here but this merely is a temporary solution and doesn’t “fix” trauma at all.

I want to finish this with my negative opinions on this book and the author. Overall, the author seems to be fairly knowledgeable and truly caring. However, this book is full of their bias, and it really shows. A few examples are as follows. The author does a good job at adding references in this book when making claims, but when you pay attention to the location of the references, it is clear that the author is tacitly picking and choosing what they need to reference. For one, the author really hates drugs (and by that I mean medications used to treat people with mental disorders or trauma). He makes that very clear throughout this entire book. So he will reference some statistics that say drug use is bad when he makes a claim. But then a few sentences later he makes another claim that negatively talks about drugs, but doesn’t cite any reference. He tries to make you think that the reference 3 sentences ago would also be for this, but in reality it doesn’t. I see this as pseudo-science. He thinks he is being clever but in reality he is just being a biased con artist and not even close to a real scientist. As I mentioned early, the epilogue to this book is just atrocious, This is where he gets into politics and tries to tie trauma to all sort of institutions and societal structures. He blames trauma on guns, healthcare, teachers, etc. He think that teachers are to blame (they dont comfort kids enough) and writes off the parents bad behavior at home as “something that happens, but the teacher needs to be the ‘parent’ then”. He paints the USA at times as some crazy country where schools and healthcare is years behind what it should be, but doesn’t talk about these same exact issues (sometimes even worse) in Western Europe where these political structures are different, but the problem still remains. I’m very happy this was an epilogue and not an introduction because if it was I would have thrown this book into my compost bin immediately if it was.",positive

So, this book changed my life. No, really. In fact, it’s *saved* it.

I have severe PTSD. And despite years of therapy, it seemed to be getting worse instead of better. My flashbacks were occurring more and more often. I was becoming more and more lethargic and frozen in time. And suicide was constantly just *there* in my mind. Constant. I’d even set a date.

And then my insurance quit paying for my therapy.

As a last, desperate grasp for help, I started to read this book.

I have never read anything more validating and more hopeful. To see the brain scans and hear the science that explained *exactly* what has happened to my brain, what is going on during my flashbacks and why I’m always physically sick—all the times I’ve gone to a doctor in pain or feeling like I’m having a heart attack or a stroke only to be told they can’t find anything wrong—brought me to tears. It gave me all the answers I’ve been searching for. It gave everything a scientific, medical explanation—and a path to *healing*.

He explained why all of my EMDR therapy wasn’t working—it was because my therapists (bless them!) were doing it wrong. And I’ve been able to take what I’ve learned from my therapists and this book and do EMDR on my own, and today... today I feel more like my old, genuine self, than I have in *years*. The shadow of suicidal thoughts no longer follows me. I feel *light*. And I have *hope*—genuine *hope*—that I actually *can* get better! I’m always telling people *they* can get better and there’s hope for *them*... but I haven’t felt that way about myself. Now, I do. I haven’t had that hope in a long, *long* time. And I even think, after years of struggling and finally making such great progress in such a short time, maybe—just maybe—I can be cured. I never thought I’d say that! The future is so exciting to me now!

If you have trauma, do be warned—Dr. van der Kolk talks a lot about his clients and their traumatic experiences and it can be very triggering. Some of the details I felt he definitely could’ve left out, honestly. However, the scientific information, the validation and the information on how to heal trauma, has made this book absolutely *priceless* to me. It’s my trauma bible. I’ll be re-reading it in the future and constantly referring to it.

Edit: I keep seeing reviews on here from people who were super upset by the story of the Vietnam vet who murdered a family, raped the mother and left her to die. Honestly, I flipped out at that part, too (aka, had a flashback), in large part because I misunderstood what Dr. van der Kolk was trying to say. I thought for a moment that he was trying to justify what the man did, and had to email my old therapist about it. Of course, she had the book and was able to read the scene. She encouraged me to reread his conclusion, and pointed out to me that he’s actually saying how difficult it was to try to treat him objectively because what the man had done was an absolute atrocity. He never actually justifies it. He calls it an atrocity. It’s just worded weird, and if you’re already triggered by what you’ve just read, it is *easily* misunderstood. I hope he clarifies this in future editions. You have to keep in mind that, van der Kolk’s target audience is actually other therapists. For this reason, it *was* difficult for me to read. I was violently attacked and molested at 5-years-old and repeatedly raped and abused as a teenager. His going over other people’s abuse is overly detailed at times and I had to skip many of those scenes.

However, I don’t hold any of this against him at all. The information in this book has changed my life, I feel seen and validated, and I stand by that almost a year after reading it. I keep it right on my writing desk where it’s easily found for reference. Am I cured yet? No. Did my flashbacks stop? Nope. This year has been an unexpected nightmare full of triggers. But I’ve made *so* much progress. And I have hope. And that’s what I need to make it through each day. I sincerely believe that, through a lot of work (which I’m willing to do!), I can be cured in time. And all of that started with this book.",positive

From where does the anxiety, distractedness, or outburst originate? Are there reasons for the gut balling up into a knot and the chest squeezing tight and feeling like it will implode when unwanted memories of the distress invade? Why does the recall come in pieces, chunks, or flashes? And then there’s the inability to communicate, the mental shut-down, the emotional-frigidity; what is that all about? Is there any way to move from the trauma and its aftermath to some sense of genuine wellbeing? All of these subjects, and more, are covered by Bessel van der Kolk, founder and medical director of the Trauma Center in Brookline, Massachusetts, professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine, and director of the National Complex Trauma Treatment Network, in his 464 page paperback, “The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma”. This volume is written for both the helping-professions technician and therapist, as well as for the traumatized and their families. With thousands of book reviews already posted and published, I’ll make this review brief.

“The Body Keeps the Score” unpacks the way trauma affects us, mind, brain, and body. The author looks at multiple forms of therapy, showing their strengths and limits. He recognizes that there are “fundamentally three avenues [of therapy]: 1) top down, by talking, (re-) connecting with others, and allowing ourselves to know and understand what is going on with us, while processing the memories of the trauma; 2) by taking medicines that shut down inappropriate alarm reactions, or by utilizing other technologies that change the way the brain organizes information, and 3) bottom up: by allowing the body to have experiences that deeply and viscerally contradict the helplessness, rage, or collapse that results from trauma” (3). Van der Kolk addresses each of these approaches while explaining in detail what harrowing ordeals do to people.

The author’s proposition through the pages is that the anguish of assault and abuse “changes brain development, self-regulation, and the capacity to stay focused and in tune with others…experiences change the structure and function of the brain – and even affect the genes we pass on to our children…devastates the social-engagement system and interferes with cooperation, nurturing, and the ability to function as a productive member of the clan” (349, 351). One of the aspects that surprised me was how the “ventral vagal complex” – the vagus nerve that interfaces with other nervous systems – takes what my brain is experiencing (even re-experiencing through PTSD, etc.) and mobilizes muscles, heart, lungs and other body parts, so that I feel the alarm – or helplessness – or grief in my brain all the way down into my chest and stomach! Which means my body begins to take on muscle-memory (as we put it in martial arts)! Therefore, if “the memory of trauma is encoded in the viscera, in heartbreaking and gut-wrenching emotions, in autoimmune disorders and skeletal/muscular problems, and if mind/brain/visceral communication is the royal road to emotion regulation, this demands a radical shift in our therapeutic assumptions (88). It’s this “radical shift in therapeutic assumptions” that dominates the authors final eight chapters, where he methodically explains different “paths to recovery”. This is truly a captivating read!

Van der Kolk weaves into the technical aspects of the book biographical and autobiographical tales that help the reader to see what has gone on, and not gone on, in the world of psychiatry and psychology regarding trauma. The stories also help to cement into the imagination and comprehension what he is trying to communicate. The book is reasonably technical with neuroscience, brain studies, physiology, professional acronyms and so forth. But the author is careful to not leave anyone in the dark. It is a fascinating read that treats the audience as mature enough to handle the subject and grasp the material. I disagreed with the evolutionary explanations of how the brain develops and found the little political rant in the epilogue disappointing. But beyond these, I was almost mesmerized by the book!

“The Body Keeps the Score” is a whole textbook on physiology, brain studies and neuroscience, as well as therapeutic theories. It is not a self-help book, but readers who are looking for help will likely find it beneficial. Helping professionals may also find it advantageous as the author has a plethora of notes on various studies and articles. But I think that the biggest value will be for those who have family members, friends, and parishioners that have been through violent experiences. It gives a bigger and better perspective on what s going on, and they will be able to draw from the various paths to recovery approaches they can take as they seek to be part of the remedy and not the trauma. I highly recommend the book.",positive

140,Books,The 48 Laws of Power,$11.60,4,"there seems to be a lot of love and hate surrounding this book, so if you are curious but unsure, this review should help you decide whether or not to buy the book, and how it will impact you

First, to understand the 48 laws of power, you must know two key ideas
1. you CAN NOT escape the power game. thinking you can ""not participate"" is as foolish as thinking that you could somehow escape gravity or make the sun stand still. Robert Greene explains why in the intro with some excellent examples
2. the 48 laws of power are neither good nor evil; they are just LAWS. If someone pushed a man off a cliff would you blame gravity for for his demise? This is the mindset you must adopt in order to learn a lot from this book.

Things I Liked
- NEW PARADIGM
after reading the 48 laws, you will never see the world the same way again. once you understand some of these laws you will see many underlying currents and motives you did not see before.
- INCREASES POWER
one of the main reasons to buy the book. you wil become exponentially more powerfull by knowing and understanding these laws
-CRYSTAL CLEAR
every law is clearly outlined with ""transgression"" of the law, ""observance"" of the law, keys to power, and a ""reversal""
-GREAT STORIES
the 48 laws are packed with mindblowing and sometimes humorous stories of people in history practicing these laws. this is helpful as some of the concepts are quite abstract.

What I didn't like

-RISKY
an old proverb says "" A man who plays with snakes will eventually be bitten"". If you begin to use the 48 Laws improperly, you could get yourself in some dangerous situations, lose friends, piss off a lot a people, and destroy relationships
- REQUIRES DISCERNMENT
if you you are looking for a highly concrete book that the says ""do xyz and you will accomplish vyx"" look elsewhere. the Laws require good judgement and and and prospecting nature to practice and apply
-NOT FOR EVERYONE
If you are aghast at the idea of manipulation and deceit then read with caution.

OVERALL: If you want to have more power or a better understanding of why different situations turn out the the way they do, you should definitely read the 48 laws of power by Robert Greene. If you want to be naive, easily manipulated, weak, you should ignore this book and go watch some netfilx.
Thanks for reading",positive
141,Books,The 48 Laws of Power,$11.60,5,"Many of us are told growing up that the world is a utopian place and to adjust our behaviors accordingly. We told to ""treat others how you want to be treated"", ""turn the other cheek"", ""everything happens for a reason and works out in the end"" and ""pardise awaits us after we die"".

Most people realize that this view of the world, especially once they leave the nest, is in fact false. There is suffering and death occurring on scales at the moment that are beyond human comprehension (nature has a 99% extinction rate). People are, and quite willing, to hurt and use you for their own ends. And that if you expect to get anywhere in the world you have todo more than work hard and be kind, you must hustle, be lucky and sometimes use and push people aside.

Robert Greene in ""The 48 Laws of Power"" is first and foremost making you aware of the way the world is. Not as we want it to be but as it is. He goes through 48 ""laws"", which are really just techniques/actions, that people use to protect themselves, advance their own interest and ""gain power"". Each chapter starts with short description of the law and then proceeds to detail the law through accompanying stories and reasoning.

Overall I feel the author has created an absolute masterpiece. He's engaging, articulate, funny and smart in his writing. Personally once I really got into the book I couldn't put it down. I found myself reflecting back on my own experiences, those close to me and society at large and I saw people utilizing the laws all the time (whether they know they are is a different story). I was also suprised, in a good way, at just how diverse and applicable they were to so many different areas of your everyday life.

The only real downsides I found with the book is that it is long (probably unnecessarily so) and a bit depressing (since the laws can and often are used for evil). But that's a complaint about human nature, not the authors fault.

So what is the real purpose of the book, what do people take away from and use it for? Well the laws are really just like a diverse tool kit to be used at different times in your life. So first and foremost it's about awareness and protecting yourself. Even if you don't use the laws, or at least don't intend to use them in a bad way, other people will try to use them on you and you can adequately defend and protect yourself. As they say ""a ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" to any problem/conflict.

Second it's about using them to advance your own interests. And this where the negative reviews are entirely unwarranted. Any weapon or tool, such as a car, is not itself good or evil. Only the person wielding it is. So you can use them for good or evil. And at the end of the day really is their anything wrong with protecting and advancing you own interests (if they are noble)? The answer is no and if you want to do anything meaningful in life you must both defend and attack.

Another thing, for those still hesitant on reading the book, is this. In recovery from any major problem there is typically five steps people go through (whether they know they are going through them or not). They are ""Denial"", ""Anger"", ""Bargaining"", ""Depression"" & ""Acceptance"". This is what you will likely go through with this book. At first you'll ""deny"" the laws, you'll become ""angry"" as you see that they are in fact true and be utilizing people (how awful they are for doing so), you will start to use them for yourself and see results (""Bargaining""), ""depressed"" as you come to terms that they really work and used for evil in some cases (why does it have to be this way) and lastly you'll ""accept"" that this is just how the world works and your better of knowing about them and using them for both defense and offense.

Do you want to be a victum the rest of your life and be used, abused and hurt and left behind? Or do you want to Man (or Woman) Up to the world so you can survive and thrive in it? The answer is obvious. I have seen people, including myself, get used, abused and hurt (in some cases ending in death) because they were unaware of these laws or refused to let go of the utopian/disney view of the world. Grow up or get left behind.

As Saint Paul said ""When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things."".

I would recommend you check out Greene's other books in particular ""The 33 Stratgies of War"" and the ""The 50th Law"" (with 50 Cent). The help complete your personal technique arsenal for effective defense and offense.

My last piece of advise is to follow the unwritten ""49th law"" which is ""to not talk about the laws of power"". It is to your advatge for others not to know this stuff as they will often use it agaist you or they will resent you because they may think your using it on them. (This is the real motivation behind a lot of the negative reviews, they don't want you to know them because they put themselves at a disadvantage). I would only educate perhaps your children and a long term significant other as you want them to be protected and thrive as well. However if you can be sure you safe from harm you may want to pass it on (as someone likely did to you since your reading this review). But again be wary, when so many other people suck it makes it easier for you to stand out. As they say a good magacian never revels their secrets.",positive

You can use these as fun bedtime stories for kids!,positive
144,Books,The 48 Laws of Power,$11.60,1,"This book takes the worst parts of the human mind and drags them down into the abyss. And then thrives there. When you open this book, it's akin to stepping at the edge of the cavern. You don't notice how its stalactite-filled ceiling echo the horrors and the gore and the piss and the vomit of others that came before. Its passages are full of the bodies of good men and women who were caught by the beasts that live there. You know you should turn back after seeing the first mangled corpse, but you're enthralled by the journey. It may come off as exciting. ""What harm can it do?"" you might think. ""There's treasure at the end,"" you might think.

Then you see the first demon of forty-eight. It doesn't do anything. It stands, however, at the centre of the first level. It stares at you, its black eyes full of emptyness. You may grow scared. And you'd be right to. Or, like a fool, you will approach this horned burnt skin creature. It stands tall and appears almost as if it were a part of the cavern itself. Its transparent nature, made to lure you into thinking it does not exist, makes it even more dangerous. And when you are well within its reach, it seizes you with its mighty clawed hand and eats you whole. But something strange happens. You don't die. You fall. And you fall far.

When you finally come to, your body, full of pain, and soreness, and that horrible feeling of nausea explodes inside you. As if a piece of your soul was eaten away. It takes you a while before you realise that you are now deeper into the abyss. There's less light. But you still hear some of the comforts of nature. The rushing water into the bodies of aqua. The sound of drops from the stalactites. The distant birds chirping. You would think that what you saw was some illusion. That you slipped and fell. Or that some other thing occurred. A bad lunch; a meal that made you ill. If you were smart, you'd turn around and go home. But most people aren't smart. They keep going.

You hear a fox's cry suddenly. You can't believe your ears. A fox? Here? And you follow the sound. When you arrive to where the fox sits, its back to you. You might say, ""Oh you poor creature. Are you lost? Do you need any help getting out?"" Then it turns. It's not a fox. It's not....an animal in the normal sense. The world around you suddenly grows colder and darker. You may take a step back. But the fox, with red eyes, eyes that are bleeding and putrid and full of maggots, follows you. It's screeching. Loudly. And you cover your ears. But that doesn't help. And when the fox reaches up to you, it lunges at you. And eats its way into your heart. And you black out. When you awaken, the cavern is different. As if you were moved elsewhere. The walls are growing a faint red. Your chest feels like it's on fire. And you can't feel your arm. But it slowly begins to regain its feeling. Then you puke out blackness. It's not a puke like anything you've seen. The human body isn't made to expel something like this. Something is clearly wrong. That was the second demon. You might panic and run. Or you might not. If you were smart, you'd turn around and go home. But most people aren't smart. They keep going.

You rub your head, then your arm. You get up to your feet and look around. Things seem hazy. Much darker than before. You're confused. You don't know what you saw. You look around. Maybe try and find a way out. Suddenly you see a light at the end. You decide to follow it. And you spot an old man sitting on a small mound. He had a long flowing white beard, a grand white gown with the names of holy people written and he wore a crown. Much rather, he wore seven crowns made of gold, silver and copper, and each crown was full of diamonds of various colours and shapes. His eyes were gentle. And smiled, like a father does to his child. His presence gave off something warm about it.

""Who are you?"" You might ask.

""I am the last of all that is good. Turn ye back and never return. Ere thou too shalt be consumed,"" the mysterious fellow said, in a loud and booming voice. You might think the old man mad, others might think the old man illogical, and finally others might say that he's ignorant or outdated or that he can't understand the intricacies of the new world, the modern world. He is a relic of the past, with all those pesky morals and traditions. We can't have morals or traditions in the future.

If you heed the advice, you may yet be saved. If you don't, then your soul will slowly be consumed. Until you too are no different than the demons you should rightfully fear. Even if you were not a religious person, it would be obvious to see how unethical this book is. You will become a spawn of evil. And no amount of prayer and church-going will ever be enough. Because you have been done the unforgiveable knowingly.

If you wish to learn how to use power for good, then I would recommend Aquinas's De Regno, Vincent of Beauvais's The Education of Noble Children, Cicero's De Officiis, Seneca's De Clementia, and the King's Mirror by anonymous. There are many more on the observation of power and its use in business, but these work. And you don't need to be underhanded in order to do so. The best businessman is the one who can keep his soul intact, and thinks of the good of others. Not himself.",negative

Her journalism career is already under fire as her last few stories have been too centric on what she thinks vs. the facts. While Margot is convinced, she is going in the right direction her publisher disagrees and the fight for her professional life is on.

When Margot finds her Uncle Luke in much worse shape than she imagined she starts to wonder if she can manage all this in her life. Coming home was enough of an upheaval as she never resolved her issues of her friend being killed when they were six. She has tried to move on but that is not what happened, nor does Margot think it can until she finds the killer. Everyone has their resolved conclusions about who did it but and refuse to see the connects to other murdered children including the one that just happened last night. All the similarities are there but with everyone dug into their decision of who is guilty getting them to move is impossible.

Margot is trying to deal with her uncle, an unknown person leaving cryptic notes, and the woman stalking her and too illusive to confront. The deeper Margot digs the more suspects and suspicions she comes up with and everyone she looks at has all the makings of being the one that took specifically January away but also the other girls that no one is looking at. But Margot has finally found the link from her friend January’s murder to the latest one and with razor sharp intuition she forms a plan on how to get the evidence to close the case.

Margot deals with her uncle, the multitude of potential people that could be involved, as well as forming a friendship and ally where she could never have expected who helps her bring every to fruition, or so she thought.

Ashley Flowers has written a compelling and intriguing book that is as mesmerizing and entrancing as it takes you down so many paths of potential conclusion. While you may not like the ending it is the authors choice to deal with the story and characters as she so desires.",positive
151,Books,All Good People Here: A Novel,$18.51,4,"A string of child murders in a small Indiana town become an obsession for a reporter and former resident. Margot returns to Wakarusa to care for her ailing uncle, Luke. She moves in to help with daily tasks, due to Luke’s cognitive decline. Quickly immersed again in the gossip and thrum of small town living, Margot picks up the thread of a cold case, involving the death of her childhood friend, January Jacobs, 25 years ago. The rumor mill speculates that the case is related to other recent homicides of young girls. The book loosely resembles the JonBenet Ramsey case, and perhaps the story was structured around, or inspired by, that real-life crime. The book reads like a screenplay. Heavy emphasis on plot, but no deep-dive into character development. Emotions are stated, rather than felt. Lots of telling, but very little showing. The exception to this is Jace, January’s brother. Here, Flowers gets it right. Jace’s childhood trauma is hauntingly depicted in a few vivid flashbacks and believable, nuanced dialogue. One particular two-line exchange between Jace and his mother, Krissy, is utterly wrenching. It reads like a bullet to the heart, perfectly rendering all the confusion, anger and longing of a bereft child. The scenes with Jace are sparse, but luminous and real. Other characters in the story would have benefited from this same attention to detail. The reader knows that Margot is earnest and tenacious, but in her quest to solve the mysteries of past and present, she’s met with little resistance and few obstacles. Every lead she follows pans out. Law enforcement takes her seriously, even when she says she’s being stalked by a woman, whose only defining characteristic is auburn hair. Still, the story is compelling and there is enough momentum for the reader to want to uncover the secrets and find out the truth. However, the ending arrives so abruptly and ambiguously that I thought I’d inadvertently skipped a page. I went back and re-read several paragraphs, certain that I’d missed something. I’m not sure why Flowers chose to end it on a discordant note. Shock value? Potential sequel? Perhaps to generate buzz and get people to talk about the book. Maybe because many crimes are left unsolved, and this was meant to underscore that fact. Whatever the reason, it’s a quick, worthwhile read.",positive
152,Books,All Good People Here: A Novel,$18.51,5,"I’ve been a crime junkie fan for many years now so when I heard that Ashley was writing a book, I knew I had to read it asap! I was a little worried in reading some of the other reviews about the “bad” ending that I might be disappointed in the book. However, I know Ashley is an amazing story teller from her many podcast, So I stuck with my guns and purchased it. I read the book in less than a day, it is sprinkled with little bits of true crime stories throughout. Which I loved because I was having flashes of “oh I remember that story” moments and it had me thinking back to some of my favorite crime junkie episodes. I’m a master usually of figuring out the “who did it” but this one I really never seen coming! It has you guessing all the way to the very end. I honestly didn’t love the ending, but it wasn’t horrible like the other reviews had said. I felt a sadness throughout the book with the plot in general, I’m a mother of two girls (7&3) and currently 33 weeks pregnant with twin boys, so the whole story of course pulled on my heartstrings. The ending to me was both shocking and heartbreaking. I almost cried if I’m being honest reading those final pages. But I felt it was fitting to the story and was authentic to the crazy, shocking and emotional nature of real life murder cases and the people that commit these acts. I wish there was a little more closure to the ending of a certain someone but I think she left it open for all of us to devise our own theory’s about what happens to _____. I don’t believe she will write a sequel like some speculate, but I do think this was a huge slam dunk for her break out career as a author and shows that she can truly do anything. I look forward to more reads from Ashley in the future!",positive
153,Books,All Good People Here: A Novel,$18.51,4,"In “All Good People Here,” first-time author and true-crime podcaster Ashley Flowers has given readers a “whodunnit?” of a mystery full of twists and turns that may well keep them guessing. Indeed, as I reached the halfway point, I was pretty sure I had it all figured out. Nope, I wasn’t even close.

Newspaper crime reporter Margot Davies has come home to the small town of Wakarusa, Indiana to take care of the uncle who was like a father to her and now suffers from early-onset dementia. In the next town over, only eight miles away, a young girl is found murdered, reminding Margot in a deeply personal way of the murder of her best friend and next-door neighbor, January, when they were only six. Could the two murders, and others, be connected? Is this Margot’s chance, not only to break a career-making story but to solve January’s murder and bring her killer to justice?

For the most part, “All Good People Here” is a well-written tale. The prose is professional. The dialogue is believable. Author Flowers moves the story set in the mid-1990s and late-2010s at a good pace. The characters are well-drawn. We understand what they want, why, and how their desires conflict. The small-town setting is well-depicted, especially the petty jealousies, gossip, and back-biting that can ruin reputations and turn the admired into the shunned in an instant. This is also a novel very much about family and family conflict.

I did find some logic and/or continuity problems along the way. And I thought the novel fell down at the end. The method by which part of the mystery is solved seemed somewhat unrealistic, considering ready alternatives. And readers are left hanging as to the fate of two important characters.

But all in all, I enjoyed this and am giving it 3.5 stars rounded up to 4.",positive
154,Books,All Good People Here: A Novel,$18.51,4,"I’ll start by saying I am a huge crime junkie fan, if you are not, my review may seem biased.
I believe this is a great first novel for Ashley Flowers. There were exciting twists and turns, good character development, and the setting, family dynamics, etc. were super relatable.
I felt that this novel did have some parallels with the Jean Benèt Ramsey case. There were a couple of things I wish that developed more, such as Margot’s relationship with her parents, and what Luke’s disease was. There was also a point where her uncle was described as “mean”, but that part of his character was only noted when he had episodes from his illness. It didn’t seem that his past nature was “mean” from the main character’s perspective. This book would be appropriate for teens and young adults, though there is some explicit language. This read was simple, and quick for me, I finished the book in two days. The story was captivating, however you are left with a cliff hanger which made me wonder if it will be part of a series, because there are things revealed that could set the scene for a second book. I was glad Ashley go into erotic detail with the romantic relationships as some books in this genre tend to do. Overall, my only critiques were that some of the characters could have been developed more, and some of the loose ends tied. I wish I had a second book of hers to read, because I finished this one so quickly! Kudos to Ashley!",positive

Extremely well written, this tale truly does take several twists and turns, leaving the reader on the edge of their seat wanting more. Several times I forgot I was reading Ashley's debut novel and found myself engrossed as though I was reading a Gillian Flynn or Jennifer Hillier story.

Ashley utilizes her years as a Crime Junkie to create a woven tale that leaves the reader invested in each character. The format of each chapter is set to beautifully to keep the reader able to effortlessly know who the focus of the chapter is as well as the time-line that is being covered.

However, it made me rediscover my love of reading!

Ok, now for the plot itself - it CONSTANTLY kept me guessing. Just when I had what I thought was a concrete theory, it was debunked. This happened so many times throughout the novel, up until the last page. I will be extremely disappointed if there’s not a follow up novel to this one because this story could keep going, even though I WAS left with quite a bit of closure. So many shocking moments were well incorporated, then delivered in such a well thought out way. I could tell so much thought, research and detail was used when drafting this masterpiece!

The twists & turns were exciting, but not so outlandish that you became overwhelmed trying to keep up. Each chapter a new revelation, a new clue. For a seasoned crime junkie, it felt like I kept pace pretty well with my guesses, but the ending.. it made me a bit mad. I loved the dramatics of it, but the slight cliffhanger of it kind of bothered me because it felt like an incomplete closure.
I’d love a sequel to it that delves into further fleshing out the trial that Margot asked to cover & also going through her own journey in testifying in the other ending characters trial about her harrowing experiences.

158,Books,All Good People Here: A Novel,$18.51,5,"I really loved this story. Definitely saw a lot of similarities in the JonBenet case. I thought Ashley did a great job with the story. I thought I had the killer figured out a couple times but then another twist made me think again. As with most of the other reviews, I really didn’t love the cliff hanger ending. I actually had to go back to make sure I didn’t miss a page because it had ended so abruptly. I know not all true crime stories have happy clean endings but this one just seemed rushed maybe? I feel slightly disappointed. I’ve read plenty of books that don’t end the way I thought they would but I just feel like such a great story could’ve needed better. Maybe there will be a sequel to make us all feel better about it! Despite the ending, I would still recommend the book to friends and will always support Ashley! Hope she writes more!",positive
159,Books,All Good People Here: A Novel,$18.51,5,"I am always apprehensive about a mystery/thriller/suspense novel because more often than not I have found them to be so….bland, cheesy, solvable in the first two chapters, etc. NOT this book! I almost got disappointed because I started thinking “ugh I totally already know who did it!!”, but I was wrong. Then I was wrong again, then I was wrong again. This book takes you on a journey where you hate and cheer for the same people but in the most fantastic non-frustrating way. It’s beautifully written with a touching story on top of a great mystery of “who done it”. I have told everyone about this book - my grandmother has ordered it and can’t wait for it to get there! Can’t wait for the next book from Ashley Flowers - I know she has a lot going on but another book wouldn’t hurt ;)",positive
160,Books,Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout Series),$13.89,4,"The book gave me that sad, nostalgic feeling of ""wow that was a really beautiful book.""

1) The book is a beautiful story about overcoming trauma - specifically fears about falling in love. This happens for a lot of books (I'm thinking Ugly Love as another popular romance book). But really this book has realistic trauma situations and there are so many pages that you really see the characters change and unravel from their pain points. So by the end, I really understood the two main characters (there are alternating chapter POVs!). The author explained in the note at the end that some of her friends had some tragedies happen to them while she was writing this book, and that helped her realize this book would be about choosing to love even when you know it could hurt. It's definitely the message and theme of this book so it's super good in that way. This book doubles as a therapy session tbh. In the world of mental health/relationship psychology, I would highly recommend this book. You're basically watching an anxious-avoidant relationship both become more secure (hence the title of the book: Things We Never Got Over)

2) This book is too long. I'm really not kidding. The first 20 chapters should have been cut in half like at best. The author said in the author's note she did not know what the book would be about when she wrote it, I kinda see that still. It's just a lot of romance building and when I tell you the second half of the book is SOOO strong with all the conflict and juicy drama, the length of first half was not needed. Like not needed. As someone who reads a lot of scripts for shows/movies, I am a big fan that every word on a page as a writer should be earned, and so much of the beginning was truly boring to the plot. I am impressed by the original readers who kept on going and then gave the book high reviews. I truly just kept on reading because this book was talked about so much that I had to see the hype. In Hindsight, I would have read a summary online for the first half of the book and then skipped to chapter 21 and started reading the book from then on. Still would have been an over 300-page book to read.

3) This should be an exciting series! The author interweaves other characters' love lives so there will be more books in the future that let us see these other characters fall in love. I am so excited cause Lucy and Sloane brought the heat that sometimes I was more engaged in their bickering than in Noami and Knox's.

4) There's sunshine / grumpy love and then there's like good girl submissive energy / bad boy dominant energy love and this relationship is more the latter. Grumpy guy's usually aren't rude to the actual girl (they are more like thoughtful grumpies...like Adam Carlsen or Luke Danes). This guy at the beginning was just straight rude to the female lead. I was like now what the heck. And home girl had like no backbone to him, for 90% of this book. Like he straight disrespected her many times so I wasn't really into him as a character. I just have a distate for men treating women like garbage but then buying them gifts and so its supposed to be okay? (um no.) until of course then in the end I got more proud of him over time, but to me he's definitely a guy where he's not really my type. (But for those who read the book, I'm probably more of a girl like Sloane.) So yes just a heads up for readers, it's more of the good girl / bad boy chemistry.

5) LOTS of relationship psychology and psycho-analyzing. Sometimes I liked it, other times I felt that the author copied and pasted therapy quotes online and put them into the book. As in it was very generic quotes about choosing love over fear. This book is full of a lot of emotionally unintelligent grown adults being told things they should have learned in their 20s. How have both of the leads not worked through their relationship patterns by now or been told them before? These are conversations people usually have in their 20s, but it might just be a generational thing that people are learning how to heal later. But just a heads up that characters are being told advice that seemed very young to hear for their age. They easily could have been in their 20s in terms of their behavior.

Overall:

Really great book about trauma and choosing love over fear! Way too long of a book, really strong second half, and would highly recommend it if you like good girl/bad boy love tropes or like relationship psychology since there is a lot of relationship psycho-analyzing that the characters do with each other.",positive
161,Books,Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout Series),$13.89,5,"Grumpy man who is unable to stop thinking about woman, said woman’s life turning upside down after her twin sister stole her money, car, and then found out she had an eleven year old niece! Talk about a lot going on for Naomi Witt. This story had everything I could possibly want and more from the grumpiness of Knox, Naomi trying to figure out the whirlwind mess that became her life, and somehow in the mist of all the drama, love found a way, and there were some added heartfelt moments as well as funny moments too!

Right from the start, Naomi had just come out of a big mess, but just when she thought things couldn’t get any worse, her twin sister Tina, stole all of Naomi’s things, and left her to care for her niece, Waylay, who she didn’t even know existed. Add into the mix the ever so grumpy and tough Knox, who seemed to not only make Naomi angry, but frustrated both mentally and physically *wink, wink. Knox seemed annoyed yet somehow fascinated by Naomi from the way she carried herself to low key checking out her Facebook to see everything about her, to having some spicy dreams about Naomi that left him wanting her in ways he had never felt before. Not to mention, Knox downright telling Naomi to her face that she wasn’t his “type” haha very funny Knox because based off the way he acted towards her throughout the story would seem otherwise. So you could only imagine the tension that occurred between Naomi and Knox was both a pleasure and entertaining to watch unfold.

I loved seeing Naomi adapt to the new changes in her life a.k.a. trying to care of Waylay and trying to be the best guardian she could be for her, especially since Tina (Waylay’s mom) never cared for her, and treated her badly. Naomi wasn’t the only one who cared for Waylay, but also Knox, Nash, Liza J, and Naomi’s parents, and the whole town of Knockemout. Having those people rally around Waylay and provide her with both love and support was so heartwarming to see. Plus you could tell that Waylay appreciated having that sense of true family around her since she never really had that to begin with. Naomi struggled in the beginning trying to grapple with ways to connect with Waylay, and provide her with all the necessities she could possibly need and want. Thankfully with the residential grumpy man that was Knox, he definitely went above and beyond to help Naomi with Waylay.

Through the drama that came with Tina and trying to make sure Waylay was taken care of, Naomi had a lot on her plate, but somehow during all of it, she caught the eye of Knox. What I found so amusing with Knox was that he was aware that he was grumpy and *cough a bit rude to Naomi, but what also made me laugh was that he would sometimes complain about constantly thinking about Naomi or felt kind of annoyed having to pull her out of trouble. In all honesty though, Knox wanted to help out Naomi because he genuinely wanted to be there for her. If anything, Knox wasn’t use to the feelings that Naomi brought out in him, and therefore resorted to being his grumpy self and blamed his body’s reaction to only wanting Naomi in a purely physical way. Haha joke was on Knox because based off the chemistry he and Naomi had, their connection went beyond just physical. While I will say, the passion between those two was AMAZING (especially reading it!) the spice, the dirty talk, and pure wanting lust between was… WHOA! And of course we can’t forget how demanding and possessive Knox was over Naomi.

In addition, I loved how Knox became sort of Naomi’s unofficial yet official caretaker, provider in a way. Naomi was so use to taking care of everyone from always cleaning up Tina’s messes to literally doing everything for Ex in her previous relationship, Naomi did it all! Knox saw that Naomi always put others needs before her own, and he wanted to be the one to take care of Naomi. Something in the pit of Knox’s gut just had this natural instinct of protection over Naomi, wanted to be her “hero”.

This story was absolutely amazing! I loved that with each chapter, I was drawn in more by the characters, the plot, and the overall feeling I got while reading. I couldn’t put this book down, and if I wasn’t reading it, I was thinking about it constantly! I especially loved the tight knit community that was in Knockemout. How everyone helped one another, came together as a community, and the overall support everyone provided for Naomi and Waylay. This story captured my heart, Naomi and Knox definitely had some bumps in the road, but they ultimately had their “happy ending”. Just when I thought the story ended on a beautiful note, the epilogue& bonus epilogue had me weeping tears of joy. Do yourself a favor and read this book.",positive
162,Books,Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout Series),$13.89,5,"I bought this e-book version back when it was available to all (in fact, I'm pretty sure I pre-ordered it because I have fallen in love with Lucy's writing!). Since then, Lucy has sold her UK rights and this version is no longer available to buy (I live in Aus, so I assume that is connected to those book rights). I'm now redirected to the UK publisher one. Why am I writing about this? Well, I also bought the audible version. And I don't usually do this, but I ended up reading along with the narrators. So I noticed that the audible version has a bonus epilogue set about five years into the future that isn't in my ebook. I don't know if this is an audible extra, or an extra that was added at a later date, but I no longer have access to because I own the US copy which shows me it's not for sale in my country. Either way, if you can get a hold of that epilogue, you need to. It was that amazing cherry on top of an already delicious cake.

I don't know why, but this story (at least at the beginning) really reminded me of the Kristen Ashley book, Sweet Dreams. The whole gruff, closed-off, rude alpha-male. The likable heroine who seems like a snob (but isn't) that everyone falls in love with. The small town, the interactions which always go wrong, and yet you feel the chemistry jumping off the page. But where I can't really go back and reread Sweet Dreams without wanting to bang my head against a wall (Tate is actually a red-flagged, gross hero when you look back with 2022 eyes), this one rights a lot of those wrongs. For one, Naomi is smart, she's strong, she's super funny, and after what happens toward the end of the book, she picks herself up and fights on. I liked that. Yes, she's flawed, and she definitely makes some questionable choices, but I really liked her.

I also really liked Knox. He had his stubborn moments which lead to acting like an idiot, but he was so lovable. He was protective, sweet, romantic in his own way, and he grew within the story.

All of the secondary characters added warmth and humour to the world. I'm also super excited to read more about Nash and Lucien, as well as anyone else Lucy will give us. Is it too much to ask that Lucy give us an m/m romance about Stef? *pleading puppy dog eyes*

If you love small-town romance which have plenty of humor, super hot sex, and a romance to make you swoon, then I highly recommend you buy Things We Never Got Over. And then if you love this one, definitely go check our Lucy's Riley Thorn series. I got similar vibes with this story.

Finally, the audible version was fantastic and I highly recommend it. Well worth the credit!",positive
163,Books,Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout Series),$13.89,5,"Loved this book! Love how it began by explaining how November 9 was a hard day for Fallon because it’s the anniversary of the day a fire almost took her life. That fire left scars all over her body that took away her self confidence. On one November 9, Fallon meets up with her dad at a diner to eat, where she meets a guy named Ben. They immediately hit it off, as he is the first to make her truly feel beautiful, scars and all. However, Fallon is set to move to New York the next day, and her mother always told her that a woman finds herself between the ages of 18-23, so to basically not settle down during those ages. So, Fallon and Ben agree to meet up every November 9 for the next 5 years. They are to have no other contact throughout the year until this day. Well they meet up each year, and things happen in their lives that cause turmoil. One November 9, Fallon discovers Ben’s manuscript and starts reading it and reads that Ben was responsible for the fire that almost took her life. This was huge, because up until now, she thought her father was responsible for it. She ends up reading more of his manuscript and realizes he set the fire for pure reasons. Ben’s mom committed suicide when he was 16. He had no suspicions for her to do this, so he starts checking her phone and he blames it on Fallon’s father since they had been having frequent conversations. When he gets to Fallon’s fathers house, he’s cleaning his prized car, seemingly unfazed by the news that his lover has died. This pissed Ben off so he wants to burn what he loves the most, his car. However, it ends up catching the house on fire, where Fallon was unbeknownst to him. She ends up forgiving him though and they live happily ever after. Such a sweet story.",positive
164,Books,Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout Series),$13.89,5,"This is book was all over my reading recommendations. I have read many Bad Boy/Good Girl stories that reading another one was not really exciting; at first… I decided to finally start reading it after weeks of buying it and boy was I hooked! Yes, the first 15-20 chapters felt infinite and it took too long for the spice to start. I didn’t like that I had to read about a third of the large book to start getting the adrenaline rushes which is what I read for, but I believe it was worth the wait though. The buildup in their relationship and their personality developments made the story 10 times better than your usual romance novel. The Bad Boy/Good Girl part of it was not as cliché as I thought it’d be. It had it’s own spice and originality to it and I loved it. It was new for me to read a romance novel of a couple in their late 30s and early 40s but it made it so much more real and interesting to read. I was so into it I felt every single thing like I was in it. The love, the rage, the sadness, the joy. I even want to have kids now.

Anyways definitely recommend if you’re a sucker for a hate to love romance, with lots of intense love making, and a good plot going on around them.",positive

There's another series that I connected with in audiobook, the Lexi Blake Butterfly Bayou books, they are awesome.

But it will hold your interest, you will want to keep reading, you might get a laugh, and well.. let's just say it might light a fire in your southern regions.
Some of the dialogue isn't exactly believable (no one calls people names THAT often in one interaction), but it was easy for me to ignore that - just chalked it up to me not being crazy about the author's writing style - or maybe that was just character development that I didn't quite jive with. Additionally some of the life-stuff wasn't all that believable either -- but again, easy to ignore. Overall, the characters were fun to get to know (there were little bits and pieces of their lives you keep putting together as the book goes on), it pulled at your heartstrings and you wanted the ""good guys"" to win, plus there was TONS of sexual tension that... well ultimately ended up in some pretty steamy scenes that were raunchy for sure, but also pretty dang exciting. If ya catch my drift.
And regarding the swearing/sex - it's a mature novel. I would not let my teenager read it. I wasn't overly offended but there were some instances where I thought it was unnecessary and slightly awkward. There are some explicit sex scenes that are very descriptive so... if that's not your cup of tea, don't bother with this one. But if you're like ""meh, one or two steamy scenes won't hurt as long as that's not ALL this book is about"" - then give it a read!
I think it's definitely worth the $4 to purchase on kindle, I'm not sure I would spend the extra for a hard copy. Maybe, if I want a steamy read, I'd read it again someday.",positive

BEST READ OF 2022 ❤️ I’ve never loved a book so much before! I didn’t want it to ever end 😩 it absolutely deserves all the stars!
Score painted a wonderful image of what Knox looks like in my head & holy hell is he one gorgeous Viking! 🤤 tattoos, muscles, tall, outdoorsy = my kind of man
There’s just something about small town romcoms! Like I actually want to live in Knockemout now!
I loved every single character even though there were times Knox was a little too grumpy!
The witty banter had me laughing + giggling throughout. I don’t think I’ve ever had a book make me smile so much before!
There’s a little bit of everything in this story from family drama to mystery to falling in love but Score ties it all together so impeccably well 🤌🏼 *chefs kiss*

168,Books,Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout Series),$13.89,4,"I started reading this book because I thought it was a thriller. After reading Lucinda Berry and Minka Kent, this one was recommended so I jumped in. It's a thriller but not a psychological thriller (although there is a psycho). The story begins with Naomi, a runaway bride racing to the aid of her twin sister, Tina (afore mentioned psycho) who has skipped out on her young daughter. Naomi, being the good twin, cares for her niece, starts a new life and enters a relationship with the town's hot bad boy. Of course,they both have baggage and work on a budding relationship with some steamy scenes that might require a cold shower for the reader. Mystery and criminal intent enter into the mix as well. There's a full cast of interesting characters and a good storyline that is funny, thrilling and endearing. I would recommend it for a fun romp!",positive
169,Books,Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout Series),$13.89,5,"Really enjoyed this story. Naomi is a unique h, sometimes a bit maddening as she gives all to others and puts herself last. The difference is she is loved and appreciated for it while those around her try to convince her to ask for what she wants more. She’s not a doormat or weak, although why she lets her evil twin take advantage is a puzzle at times. Her strength is in helping and caring for others. She is left homeless, car less, and broke in a small town and saddled with an 11 yo niece she never knew about, courtesy of her bad twin. Knox is such a lovable but broken curmudgeon. He gives Naomi grief while also looking out for her in his own way. It takes some dangerous events before Knox realizes he can’t live without Naomi and her sassy niece. Waylay and even the dog Waylon add tons of humor and warmth to the story. Secondary characters in the small town make you want to live there. I don’t know if it was unintentional, but certain elements reminded me a lot of Sweet Dreams by Kristen Ashley. Knox reminded me of one of Ashley’s protective, possessive alphas and the scene where Naomi overhears Knox calling her uppity and needy feels like it was straight out of that book. I loved that book so I might be off base with my comments. There is a mystery running through the story and some elements of danger, but not enough to be considered romantic suspense imo. I found myself tearing up a few times and that’s the sign of a great story.",positive

180,Books,Educated: A Memoir,$11.70,5,"I highly recommend this book about a girl whose childhood began on a beautiful mountain in a narrow world created by her father’s anti-establishment mindset of fear, insanity, and control and ended when she decided to venture out into the wider world and research the facts for herself. Will she come home? Can she come home? Or will home be more damaging to her spirit than the broader dangerous world her father fears? I will try not to give spoilers, but most of the information in this review was provided by the book’s author in interviews. It’s not the bare facts which are so fascinating, but the story itself and how it plays out. If you’ve ever been gaslighted, scapegoated or lied about by your own family, you will find in Tara Westover a true kindred spirit.
The title of this book might give the impression it’s merely about going to school. While the author’s lack of primary education is offset by her future ability to earn a doctorate at Cambridge, her education about society and the world outside her family is just as important as her rise academically.
You might say Tara Westover’s education started while she was very young. Her life began on an Idaho mountain with survivalist parents. A father who distrusts the government and runs an ever-spreading scrap yard. A mother who is practically coerced by her husband to become a midwife. Born the youngest in a family of seven, her mother must’ve burned out on homeschooling by the time Tara came along because she didn’t get much book learning. Her first level of education included prepping with her family for the time of desolation, dodging her father’s careless flung scrap metal while she does child labor in his junkyard and accompanying her mother to home births. Tara’s early survivalist education includes learning how to survive her parents’ ignorant choices and a bullying older brother—all of which are much greater threats than her father’s perceived threats of the government taking over their lives.
Her parents rarely leave the mountain. They are home-birthers, home-schoolers, anti-vaxers, anti-establishment and anti-medical care. In a nutshell, her father seems nutso—more like a deranged lunatic with a massive stockpile of weapons than a father.
Tara’s mother appears to be her husband’s enabler as she meekly follows suit and rationalizes his unhealthy choices even when they threaten her safety and the health of her children. As a matter of fact, for a woman who eventually created a lucrative business by claiming to be a healer by designing her own line of essential oils, her mother’s only safety instinct seems to be to protect the family secrets.
As Tara watched the insanity and chaos of her parents’ poor choices, she had one example of life beyond the mountain. One older brother left home and went to college. He encouraged her to do the same. This book is about her quest to get out from under her father’s control—first physically, then emotionally and eventually spiritually. This process didn’t happen overnight. As anyone who has grown up under a narcissistic parent and knows what it’s like to be bullied and gaslighted will find it easy to relate to Tara’s journey.
This memoir is the story of a girl who was thirsty for knowledge, got a sip of real truth and refused to drink the kool-aid any longer. It’s the story if being scapegoated and gaslighted until she questions her sanity. It’s sad, but this book is also about the loss of siblings who would prefer to vote the family line than treat their sister as a friend. It’s also a story of triumph about the girl who escaped the box she was expected to stay in and become the one who got away from all the drama and insanity of her family of origin.
It’s incredible that Tara Westover succeeded in getting a doctorate from Cambridge, but even more amazing is her social education and how she eventually transformed like Pygmalion and was able to self-differentiate from her parents and choose the life she desired for herself.
This book is an exciting read. I read it around the clock within two days. It’s also complicated enough to provoke intellectual discourse about what it means to be faithful to oneself and how loyalty to family plays out against self-worth and self-knowledge.
This memoir is the fourth book I’ve reviewed about a woman raised in a fundamentalist Mormon family. The first three were all brought up in polygamous households, but Tara only had two parents who kept their family in the local ward despite her father’s concerns about the Illuminati infiltrating the mainstream Mormon church. This family looks Mormon from the outside, but a more sinister agenda lies under the surface. She makes it clear this is NOT a book about Mormons but rather the head-spinning tale of a dysfunctional family. She reminds us that most Mormons send their children to public school and go to the doctor when it seems necessary. The fundamentalist vibes which are all there, under a cloak of self-righteousness, could be manifested within any denomination or cult.
The only thing that made this book uncomfortable for me to read was the descriptions of the terrible injuries this family continually sustained due to the father’s stupidity. I constantly cringed at these stories much like I would while watching a show about life-threatening emergencies. Even worse, her father truly believed all these near death injuries were ordained by his arbitrary version of God. It was all I could do to keep from screaming. Such vivid descriptions were necessary though for the reader to understand what Tara had to endure.
It’s not much of a spoiler to say Tara is eventually going to go no contact with some of her family members. She has told this in interviews. What is impressive about Tara is that she shows no bitterness. She loves her parents and family but has chosen to separate from them as a boundary for her sanity. Or did they shun her first? As in most narcissistic family survivor stories, it’s often hard to tell.
This memoir is a true survival story about surviving a survivalist mindset. This book is the tale of narcissistic, emotional and spiritual abuse and one girl’s victory in becoming herself despite being vilified and gaslighted. My favorite quote from the book sums up Tara’s journey,
“I am not the child my father raised, but he is the father who raised her.” -Tara Westover
Tara’s story is a victory of education, but even more, it’s a triumph of her courage to rise up beyond the mountain—the only home she ever had to find her authentic home within herself. Bravo Tara Westover! You are an amazing survivor! Thank you for documenting your often painful journey so the rest of us can know that although our stories may vary, we are not alone.",positive
181,Books,Educated: A Memoir,$11.70,4,"“Educated” by Tara Westover is a story about Tara’s life growing up in a Mormon family in Idaho. Even by Mormon standards, her father especially, is an outsider in his own faith tradition. Eccentric might be another term that one would use. Tara and some of her other younger siblings are never sent to school and their so-called “homeschooling” is basically no schooling. Her father believes school will contaminate his children to the world- a world in which he sees himself as God’s prophet.
There are so many psychological and religious issues in this story that I can relate to on so many levels from my own personal experience. Although, I grew up Mennonite and not Mormon and the religious beliefs are different, the cultural dynamics are similar.
First, Tara grows up in a family were the father is the ruler and women are seen as needing to always be submissive to men. This is a standard Mormon belief as well as one of many evangelical Christians, but her father uses that belief to control and to manipulate his family into a separate kind of lifestyle ruled by paranoia of everything “out there”, religious superiority, and an expectation of family loyalty. He does this through demanding an adherence to a distorted preaching of his faith as the one and true faith, by shaming his children if they so much as show any interest in how others live and attempt to copy that behavior. I couldn’t help but make that connection to my own father. Though my father was not nearly as off-center as Mr. Westover, I recognized the same behavior from my childhood. The result is the child feels alone and unable to connect with anyone often for life.
Tara finds herself alienated from everyone in her world except her family. She sits alone in Sunday School and of course, she has no friends for two reasons. She feels different from everyone else and her father makes sure that she has no time or opportunity to cultivate friendships with others. He stresses that girls she meets are not good enough for her. Her father uses his faith to condemn them as not living the way a person of God should live. She, therefore, feels guilty for even wanting to associate with such “wicked” people.
Tara, even after she leaves home and goes to college, finds herself unable to fit in and at odds with pretty much everyone. I don’t think she, for many years, recognizes that this is a result of the socialization or lack thereof from her home life. It is deeply and complexly rooted in the emotional, psychological, religious, and cultural dynamics of her early years. I find it interesting that she titles the book, “Educated,” as if obtaining an education is what moves her to a place in society that she is accepted as “normal” by others. The lack of education is a handicap and with certainty will keep her a captive in her father’s strange world, but it is not what makes her feel alone, strange, and like she doesn’t belong in the new world that she explores. Getting educated will not fix what is broken inside of her from her childhood. It only gives her a better platform from which the self can say, “Now I am somebody.” I did the same thing. I went to school and got a master’s degree and a job that is viewed with respect and awe. And while working in it, I feel strong, accepted, and like I have worth. But outside of it, I still feel friendless and different from everyone else. I watch Tara as the story progresses feeling this total alienation from others and struggling with it. From my own experience, I have learned the feeling never goes away. One simply has to learn to be comfortable with being alone and knowing that this is who I am.
A part of her psychic also does the same thing that I did with my family even after leaving. It longs for the love of one’s parents and siblings. Tara, like me, keeps coming back to the family trying to convince them of reality and what is right. Even though on a logical level, one comes to understand that one’s family is mentally unhealthy, there is this deep seated needed to stay connected to them. Afterall, if those who bore you and nurtured you in childhood don’t love you, then why would anyone else especially God. Tara loses herself and becomes mentally unstable for a year after she realizes that her family does not want to know the truth that one son has been viciously abusing other members. Her parents are not interested in addressing the problems in the family and the highest value of loyalty makes everyone choose to accept “the delusion that they are one big happy family” which will allow them to remain part of the family. Tara realizes that the family “truth” and loyalty are more important than loving her. This is devastating to her.
What really destroys her is that her mother betrays her in this battle to expose evil. Her mother one minute acknowledges to Tara that she knows about and will speak to her father about Shawn’s unacceptable behavior. But when there is an actual confrontation, her mother turns against her and sides with her father. Her mother tries to destroy Tara’s reputation and character. For the mother to stand against the patriarch of the family requires too high of a price. It reminds me so much of my own mother who swung from seemingly being rational to total denial and perpetrating vicious attacks on my character. It leaves one very confused and in the case of Tara, she cannot concentrate enough to even study. She falls into a deep depression. She had this deep-seated hope that her family would change because of her speaking the truth. But her family, like mine, was incapable of changing. Denial is a powerful substance that keeps the system stable no matter how dysfunctional. Only the individual has the power to change and often doesn’t because of these pressures from different aspects of society to conform, especially the family of origin and one’s religious community.
If you enjoy exploring the complex dynamics of families, “Educated” is a compelling read. My books “If You Leave This Farm” and “No Longer a Child of Promise” also explore many of the same dynamics. My third book, “Once An Insider, Now Without a Church Home” explores the same dynamics and pressures within the evangelical church as found within the family. One is only a friend and a member as long as one follows the dictated expected behavior and norms.
I appreciate all those who have the courage to write their stories. It helps me to know that I am really not alone and that I don’t need to be ashamed to share my own story.",positive
182,Books,Educated: A Memoir,$11.70,5,"“Women have been coaxed, cajoled, shoved and squashed into a series of feminine contortions for so many centuries, that it is now quite impossible to define their natural abilities or aspirations.”

Up until recently, (possibly now that I’ve read this book honestly), I would write off nonfiction. I would say it wasn’t my type and didn’t interest me. I was wrong.

This book has feminism, family angst, educational disparities, and so much more it is near impossible for me to explain how much I enjoyed it and how much it engrossed me.

If you are interested in the power of education, discussion of mental illness, family unit discussions, and the power of femininity, you will love this book.",positive
183,Books,Educated: A Memoir,$11.70,5,"I don’t often offer a 5-star review to many books. To me, a five star review means a book that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone. I usually think deeply, after I have finished a book, and think about whether the book has changed my viewpoint, or what I would do differently after reading it, and whether the book had a profound influence on the way I live, think, or speak. This book was different. This book won’t likely change the way I act or live, or even think about certain subjects- but the elements of the story Tara Westover has shared are shockingly familiar to me. It’s the story of living with bipolar disorder- seeing it’s influence on a family, especially to the next generation.

As the youngest son of a bipolar father, I have no words when I tell people about my childhood. It’s difficult to express to people why I don’t have a relationship with my father. “It wasn’t all bad…” is a phrase I have used a lot. I honestly don’t know how to tell the countless horrific scenes; the endless cycles of emotional abuse, and the strength of my own mother who was strong enough to break the cycle. “It wasn’t all bad,” to me, has always disguised the fact that all too often, it was bad. Tara Westover has told her story in a way which will resonate with children of bipolar families, victims of abuse both physical and emotional, and so many others. This 5-star rating was different for me. There was no hesitation; no deep thinking. There was an almost desperate quickening pace to the book as I saw Tara’s story unfold… that I wanted to finish her story, for she has found the words- the strength and daring- that I could never find. 5 stars.",positive
184,Books,Educated: A Memoir,$11.70,5,"I picked up Educated after seeing that it topped numerous lists as best book of 2018. It did not disappoint. Educated is a memoir, chronicling the author’s childhood and early adulthood. What makes her story unusual is that she was raised by survivalist fringe Mormon parents in Idaho, both of whom had mental health issues.

Having spent time in both Utah and Mormonism, I can attest to the fact that people like this exist. They view themselves as more Mormon than Mormons. They prepare for the end times. They have guns and food storage. They pride themselves on their independence and self-reliance. They homeschool their children (giving homeschoolers everywhere a bad name). These are people who shoe horn life events into their belief system and define them as being from God - even when the events were preventable accidents caused by their own stupidity.

The book is divided into three parts.

Part One chronicles the author’s childhood and her very gradual realization that there may be more to life than she is experiencing. Following the advice of one older brother (while dodging the physical blows of another), she studies for the ACT and prepares to attend college, an enterprise for which she is woefully underprepared. This section takes up nearly half the book and is the most interesting.

Part Two details the author’s experiences at BYU, where she is confronted for the first time with just how different she really is from other Mormons. She comes to recognize her abnormal upbringing for what it is, yet flounders while trying to survive in this new world. Details about her home life remain the most interesting. The descriptions of her college life could have been more fleshed out; in the end, she does not even reveal her college major. It will tell you just how far out there the author’s family is that BYU of all places is considered to be basically of the devil.

Part Three discusses the author’s graduate studies. But here as elsewhere, the primary focus remains on her family and her gradual disenfranchisement from the family. That the author would become distanced from her family was a given; she not only left to gain an education, she was a girl who left for greener pastures. A girl … whose place should have been in the home, according to the family she left behind. Her actions come to be seen as evil. That her father believes his own actions to be at all times correct and divinely inspired only increases the divide between the author and her Idaho family members, especially when she outs her abusive older brother. The real surprise here is that she does not seem to understand that her parents already knew he was abusive. But their staunch denials leave Tara no choice but to live in her own reality or theirs.

It is worth noting that from humble beginnings the author’s parents (particularly her long-suffering mother) created a very successful ""essential oils"" business called Butterfly Express. Once you read about its origins and the clear quackery evident in its earliest beginnings, you will certainly never have anything to do with their products. Also worth noting is that apparently four of the author’s siblings and numerous grandchildren are involved in the family business and remain essentially financially dependent on her father. But there’s an irony here; the business generates a great deal of money, making this in some ways not the worst life choice. That said, the author and her remaining two brothers both got PhDs. That they did this despite their upbringing not because of it is evident; still, there was something in the lifestyle that taught these future adults to think and prepared them for a brighter future, away from their oppressive little Idaho hamlet.

I highly recommend this book. At its strongest while the author details recollections from her childhood, it is definitely a worthwhile read.",positive
185,Books,Educated: A Memoir,$11.70,5,I was sucked in from the get go. This book tells a story of a family who was completely crazy and a young women who rose above. I think Tara wanted her family and her self at the same time and when she realized she couldn’t have both she chose the road less traveled and chose her self preservation and stepped away from the crazy. This book makes me want to dig deep into religious history and discover more. I also would love to read her doctorate.,positive
186,Books,Educated: A Memoir,$11.70,5,"There are two types of popular books, one is the kind that gets a lot of hype and fanfare and sits on bestseller lists for months but ultimately falls short of all the acclaim. Second is the kind that simply lives up to your greatest expectations -- even if you were skeptical of all the aforementioned hype and fanfare to begin with. Educated is solidly, well written and exquisitely told story of survival and ultimately, success. I was skeptical because Educated stares at me from The New York Times, week after week on the bestseller list—everyone seems to have either heard of it, has read it or wants to read it. How can it be that good? Or is it just good, in the common mainstream way that some books are? But Tara Westover has written a powerful and heart-searing story about the abuse and dysfunction she experienced growing up with her wildly eccentric and religious family. Her upbringing is a far cry from what a normal childhood looks like; Tara never went to public schools and yet managed to study at Cambridge and complete her PHD at Harvard. Who wouldn’t want such a success story? But more on that in a moment.

Tara Westover’s emotional story broke my heart even as she tells it in a very matter of fact style. She’s raw and honest about her own self and shortcomings, she turns the lens on herself many times in the book, shining a light on her own bad behaviors and choices. Her story is shocking, infuriating and at times just plain, disturbing, but I couldn’t stop reading it. I didn’t feel it was redundant at all, although you can say, many of the same bad things happen to her over and over again; car accidents, freak accidents in the junkyard, physical and verbal abuse from her older brother and worst of all, the sheer lack of protection she had from her parents. The hardest thing to grasp about Tara’s story is how easily her parents did not protect her from so much, time and time again. To come from all that and to be as articulate as she is and as grounded as she seems is astonishing. Just pull up an interview of Tara Westover talking to Oprah or Ellen DeGeneres and you’ll find yourself thinking what a lovely person she appears to be. She doesn’t seem fueled with anger or overcome with emotion, she holds herself upright gracefully and tells her truth, straight. She doesn’t even talk badly about all of the ones who have hurt her so deeply. I believe that is a testament to who Tara Westover is as a person.

As far as her education, I read the many naysayer comments barking about her “too good to be true” Ivy League education and dismissing or denying how she could have not gone to public school and gotten a high school education before going off to these colleges based on what little education and home schooling she did have. I admit, it does sound too good to be true…but in some cases, some people just have what it takes; the talent, the brains, the drive and determination and the luck to get far in life. I think Tara always had it in her and the people who met her, the bishop and the professors who supported and encouraged her, felt very strongly about what Tara was capable of and I think they helped her as much as they could along the way. I think they wrote recommendation letters, persuaded her numerous times to apply for grants and funding and to take her knowledge as far as it could go. I think it was easy to see in Tara, a success story of sorts. She’s someone who transformed themselves into who she was meant to be, someone who could change her life (if not her story or her past) and transcend even her wildest dreams. I admire Tara and her success and applaud her for telling such a raw story—even if it meant risking estrangement from the people she loves.

Tara Westover has written a brilliant story and proves what a good writer she is. A good story in the hands of a bad writer would not end up being as beloved and popular as Educated is. As far as I can see, she was meant to have all her success.",positive
187,Books,Educated: A Memoir,$11.70,5,I have always thought that if you want to know why a person behaves the way they do you should look at their family and their upbringing. Your perspective on life all depends on where you were born and what you were taught as a child.

188,Books,Educated: A Memoir,$11.70,4,"Dr. Westover’s story opens a world of which I know nothing. We are introduced to one family’s experience of the belief system of Mormonism. The story is not about Mormonism. It touches superficially on some tenets of the faith. The book reaches into the experience of family members with each other and documents Tara Westover’s rise, through many challenges, and with the help of educators who recognize her abilities and intelligence, to finally achieve her level of professional competence. Life alongside the mountain princess is hardscrabble and unfair and messy and often mean. Scenes among the family members are difficult to read and difficult to forget. Having read the book, I must question, though the faith of the patriarch guides his life and his rule, what the book is actually about. The church? Family traits? Genetics? Family history? Strength?

190,Books,Layla,$8.97,5,"1st person/single POV
Spice: 2/5

This story is told from the Leeds' point of view. It starts with how he meets Layla and the path their relationship goes down to lead them back to the place where their beginning. You have a some chapters that take place in the present where he is trying to get answers for what has happened to them, and then the rest of the chapters are flashbacks mostly focusing on their time together since arriving back at the bed-and-breakfast where they met.
I love the way this was done because you are aware from the start that something has happened to them but you are not entirely sure what. Little by little things are being revealed but you still aren't entirely sure what is going on. Even when you think you have it figured out suddenly you realize you don't. I had so many conflicting emotions over the course of reading this it was so shocking. At times I was angry with Leeds for how he was handling things, but then there were other times where I felt he was handling things quite well. Probably better than most people in his situation would to be honest. Then when he meets Willow and everything gets turned upside down. I felt bad for her and Layla both at the same time. I felt bad for Leeds one minute then wanted to slap him the next. I wasn't sure who I was truly rooting for in the end because none of my feelings towards any of them made sense to me. I could justify every angle of the situation but couldn't in the same breath.
The way this story plays out is beyond what I was expecting and not once did I lose interest at any point of the book. To say it was wild is an understatement because it was not at all what I was expecting. However, it was everything I didn't know I wanted when I started it. The ending was exactly as it should have been given the scenario that went down. At times I wasn't sure how it would end or even what I wanted to happen but it all worked out in the only way it could have regardless of what I may or may not have wanted. Closure was really all I needed and that's exactly what I got.
Do not pass this one up and do not give up on it either. Even when you think you can't possibly keep going because of how you're feeling about Leeds and his actions just trust the process. It will all make sense by the time you read the last line of the book.",positive
191,Books,Layla,$8.97,4,"This book is very different from the other Colleen Hoover books I've read, and a few times the story was so... different... I thought about abandoning ship, but my past experience with the author (and the love of her other books I've read) and her gifted ability to tell a story kept me hanging on.
I can't give half stars. If I could this would be 3 1/2 stars because the story really is pretty far out there, but because of the way Hoover created the twist, somewhat redeemed many of the ""WTF"" moments with the story's resolution and because of my general respect for the author, I rounded up rather than down.

This’d how the novel “Layla” begins.

Honestly, there was a time where I wasn't sure if I was liking the story or the characters, but then BAM. It got me - another all night trying to get to the end.

The suspense and the twists in the second half of the book was not at all disappointing and Hoover once again proved how she manages to push the limits of her thoughts and awakens emotions I never thought I could feel. “Showers transform women. Leave us with flat hair, make-up smeared down our cheeks, concealer down the drain."" Colleen, that hurt my heart.

The Fifth Agreement by Don Miguel Ruiz and Don Jose Ruiz

I decided to “review” or “summarize” these books together because the Fifth Agreement is very much a continuation of the first book, and in fact reiterates much of the earlier text. Both are based on the philosophy of the Toltec, ancient people of southern Mexico who were known as women and men of knowledge.

Before delving into the books, I should acknowledge that I found then somewhat difficult. Although I have read a great many of what I would call “spiritual” books and wrings in the recent years, these readings, although similar, were a bit more difficult to fully digest. The author at times anticipates such problems on the part of the reader, and is indeed accurate in that regard.

The Toltecs were not a race or tribe, or nation, but scientists and artists formed to explore and conserve the spiritual knowledge and practices of the “ancient ones”. They came together as masters (naguals) and students at Teotihuacan, the ancient city of pyramids outside Mexico City and known as the place where “Man Becomes God”. The Toltec recognize that some 3000 years ago a human studying to be a medicine man woke to the realization that everything is made of light and that all that exists is one living being, and that light is the messenger of life because it is alive and contains all information. He called the stars the tonal and the light between the stars the nagual, and knew what created the harmony between the two is life or intent. He saw himself in everything- in every human, every animal, every tree, in the water, the clouds and the earth. As I read the book, this seeing, this realization, is the truth, is pure love and pure light. It is this truth that we much search for. But why must we search if such truth is everywhere?

We must search because we have lost the truth. When we are born devoid of language, we are the truth–our presence is a miracle. We feel and see what is, without interpretation or judgment. But, as we grow, we are what the author calls “domesticated”, just as animals are. The truth that we feel is replaced by symbols-words- that are mere illusions, that are opinions grafted onto objects and feelings. We apply our attention– the ability to discriminate and focus only on what we want to perceive- on these symbols. As children we believe what adults say, especially our parents, and our world becomes a dream, a reality built on symbols from others, not the silent feelings and observations that we experienced as infants. And this learned reality-our dream- tells us how to behave in society; what to believe and not believe; what is acceptable and not acceptable; what is good and bad; right and wrong; beautiful and ugly. We are imperfect because we do not measure up to an image of perfection that has been imposed on us by others. And we accept such law and structure by a system of reward for doing what is “right” and punishment for doing what is “wrong”. This acceptance reflects a multitude of agreements we have made with our world. We are judged and punished and then punish ourselves for bad behavior. We become victims who carry guilt for such failures, and are punished again and again whenever we are reminded, or remind ourselves of such failures. We live in a dream ruled by fear and filled with emotions of anger, jealousy, envy and hate. We must be right and prove others wrong. Our mind and our world become a fog–a mitote- a dream where a thousand people talk at once and no one understands. The author feels that, as a result, we are living in a dream of hell. We then search for the truth, for a way out of this hell. And yet, the truth is already within us, we don’t have to search, we just have to uncover what is part of us already, as it was when we were born.

To escape our dream of hell, we must break the old agreements that are fear based and reclaim our personal power. We must create a new dream, our own dream- our personal dream of heaven. The author suggests four basic agreements that you must make with yourself to reclaim your own power and find a heaven on earth, a life of joy and fulfillment.

The First Agreement- Be Impeccable With Your Word.
The author feels that this first agreement is the most important and powerful. I noticed a few things about the wording. First, he uses the singular “word”, rather than “words”. I think perhaps this is in deference to the use of such term in the bible where John, speaking of creation, says “In the beginning was the word, and the word was God, and the word is God.” Through words you express your creative power. But he obviously means the plural, that your use of language must be impeccable. The use of “impeccable” is also interesting. Our common definition of “impeccable” is faultless or flawless. But it also means incapable of sin or without sin. It is this meaning that the author employs. He feels that a sin is anything that goes against yourself, and being impeccable is not gong against yourself, taking responsibility for your actions, but not judging or blaming. He says that if one loves him or her self, then he or she will express that love in interaction with others, and will thus be impeccable with the word, because such word, such action, will produce a like reaction. He contrasts words coming from love with those coming from what he calls black magic. He feels that gossip is the worst form of black magic, for it is judgmental language about others, even those we do not know. It is emotional poison that we teach to our children and friends and loved ones through our use of such criticism. The word is too often used to blame, to criticize, to find guilt and destroy. He gives the simple example of a child being told by her mother to shut up her singing because her voice was “ugly”. The child obviously agreed with her mother, and thus made an agreement with herself not to sing any more. These are the type of agreements that we make in life that are harmful and destructive, that lead us into our dream of hell. Instead, when you are impeccable with your words, they are no longer fertile ground for gossip and criticism, but for love. And as you use such words, first by expressing love for yourself, you break all the many agreements that make you suffer, and begin to build your own dream of heaven on earth.

I don’t read “impeccable” to mean absolutely honest, for there are times when being absolutely honest could be counter to your words coming from love.

The Second Agreement- Don’t Take Anything Personally.

This is much easier said than done and I also think that the author assumes that one is practicing impeccability in their word before adopting this. He basically feels that people take things personally because we assume that things said are truly about us and that we are prone to believe them. In fact, he feels that people do not do or say things because of us, but because of themselves. Also, whatever they do or say is a product of their own belief system, of their own personal dream. Thus, what they may think about me is not about me but is about them. Instead of accepting this, we resort to the need to be right, and show the other wrong, so we magnify the power of their words or deeds.

If instead we always act from a sense of love–the impeccability of our word- then if someone is mad at me, then I know that he or she is mad at him or herself and I am just the excuse for their anger. When you stop taking things personally you can keep your heart open and not be harmed. You will not need to trust in what others do or say, but only trust yourself to make responsible choices. And you must remember that neither praise nor criticism is to be taken personally because it is not about you, but the speaker.

As I said at the outset of my comments on this Agreement, I think, in discussing this Agreement, that the author assumes that he is impeccable with his word. If not, then how could he say that when someone gets mad at you they are mad at themselves? This may still be true even if you were not using your word impeccably, but it would be harder to accept, especially since, in his discussion of impeccability, the author says that one must take responsibility for his actions. Wouldn’t this mean that when we are less than impeccable that we must accept some consequence, but not punish our self endlessly? Couldn’t someone’s anger be about us if our word was less than impeccable, but instead filled with the black magic mentioned by the author? I raise these questions in my mind because at times, as I read through this, it sounds as if one can “get a pass” for less than sterling behavior because he need not take others reactions personally. I don’t think this is the author’s message, but it could be read into some of the philosophy.

The Third Agreement- Don’t Make Assumptions

The author starts off his discussion with this statement:

“All the sadness and drama you have lived in your life was rooted in making assumptions and taking things personally.”

Although I would question the use of the word “all” (I have a hard time with such broad statements like “all” or “none” or“always” or “never”), I basically agree with his statement, especially as it concerns emotional reaction to others. (True sadness from the passing of a child or similar “objective” tragedy is hard to relate to assumptions or taking things personally) I have found that people often assume my meaning, and sometimes take offense at something that was never intended to harm. They probably misunderstood, but, as the author notes, were afraid to ask for clarification and therefore filled in any uncertainty with an assumption. I don’t know exactly why we are afraid to ask for clarification, maybe it roots back to those days when we were reluctant to ask questions in school. Maybe it a fear of being wrong, even if it is a subjective response to another. I don’t know why we do such things, but know that we do, and that it causes great and unnecessary pain.

I think these two agreements about taking things personally and making assumptions are really part of a self centeredness that “it is all about me”. We often tell people, ‘it’s not always about you” , but such words are almost in jest. In fact it is really important to realize that it isn’t always about you, especially when the assumptions made generally do assume so and lead to taking things personally. Not making assumptions would seem to be one of the easier agreements to live up to, as it only involves a little bit of inquiry. But, like any change, it requires practice. The author just suggests that you

“Make sure the communication is clear. If you don’t understand, ask. Have the courage to ask questions until you are clear as you can be, and even then do not assume that you know all there is to know about a given situation.”

Good advice.

The Fourth Agreement is About the Action of the First Three- Always do Your Best.

The author stresses always doing your best, but knowing that your best will vary from one moment to the next depending on how you feel, etc. But, whatever your state, you must always do your best–neither less nor more. Trying to do more than your best will cause you to spend unneeded energy and, in the end, your best will not be good enough. You must be motivated to do your best not by some expected reward, but by the love of what you are doing. Doing your best will help with the other three agreements and it will also make you feel better even if you suffer failures in the other three. If you keep trying to do your best you will become a master of transformation-practice will make you the master. Always doing your best requires a great deal of effort. If you break an agreement, then you must be willing to begin again the next day and try your best to keep such agreement.

In reading the author’s comments on this fourth agreement I am unsure whether he is relating “doing your best” to life in general or to the application of the other three agreements. I see his book as being primarily focused on reaching an internal contentment and happiness, not on navigating one’s way through the world at large. Admittedly, such inner contentment may well supply the path to successfully living in this rather complex world. I just find a bit of a contrast between the focus of this work and something like “Falling Upward” by Richard Rohr where he acknowledges the need to survive in the competitive world as a means of gaining some level of confidence before, in the second half of life, we are able to discard much of the baggage of the first half and seek out a more personal and spiritual contentment. Of course, this may be my misreading of both books, but, that’s what an opinion is all about. I also see a basic similarity between the two, and among other spiritual pieces that I have read. All see Western culture as imposing and espousing a very competitive, win/loose guilt ridden mentality. Such mentality may or may not be necessary for the struggles that we face, but, all my readings seem to agree that at some point our thoughts need to focus on attaining a more peaceful and inclusive level of spiritual contentment. This is the truth that the Four Agreements challenge you to seek.

The Fifth Agreement - Be Skeptical but Learn to Listen

As the author has pointed out, we learn from symbols, and these symbols do not represent the truth, which is present in everything. Symbols are people’s interpretations of objects and feelings and are not the truth, but are often lies. Thus, it is important to be skeptical, but he adds that you must then listen. When you listen carefully to others you can then understand the symbols that they are using and understand their story–their dream. Your communication improves and you can then see if what another is saying has relevance to you. You do not have to believe their story, for it is only symbols. Similarly, you do not have to believe your own story, for it is just made from your symbols. Neither story is the truth, the truth simply is, whether you believe in it or not. It doesn’t need you to believe, for it simply is.

When you listen you don’t have to form or express opinions, you merely need to listen. By merely listening you show respect for the other person’s dream, for the reality he or she has created. The author sees all persons essentially as artists who create their worlds, and they must be respected as such. When we listen and share our stories, we try to understand them and make them part or our stories if we so desire–or not. If you gain control over your symbols then what is left is the real you, and the real you, not your symbols, makes your choices.

In trying to summarize what the author is saying I find myself struggling at times to get to the crux of his message. I think that perhaps by expanding his work to this Fifth Agreement he intends to open the door to spread the wisdom of the Four Agreements to others. The first Four Agreements taught us that out symbols are not the truth, and that many of these symbols–our entire symbology as he calls it- are lies that lead us to blame and shame and guilt, to a living hell. The Four Agreements help us escape this personal hell, but perhaps there is more that we need to do.

The author expands his discussion to outline the different stages that we go through as we try to reach our heaven on earth. He calls these steps “attentions”. The first Attention is the dream we create when we first use our attention to absorb the various symbols that we learn, and we then believe such symbols represent knowledge and our reality. He calls this first attention the ordinary dream of humans or the dream of the victims. It is a dream of victims because we are the victims of the false symbols which form our reality. And our reality is not about us, it is a mirror reflecting what others expect of us and for us. You must be freed of such reality and discover your true self.

Then we reach a stage where we realize that our dream is a lie and we use the attention a second time to try to change our dream and create a new one. This is the Second Dream of Attention or the Dream of the Warriors because we now declare war against all the lies in our knowledge. It is a war against that part of our mind that makes all the choices that guide us into our personal hell. It’s a war between out true self and our belief system–what the author calls the tyrant or the big judge. In this battle we fight to throw off the belief system that causes us to repeatedly punish ourselves for past “wrongs”- the system that brings up past thoughts and punishes us over and over again. The author notes that

“Humans are the only animals on earth who punish themselves a thousand times or more for the same mistake, and who punish everybody else a thousand times or more for the same mistake.”

He instead postulates that true justice is to pay once for every mistake. As a warrior, one fights to find his true self.

The author then notes that the dream of the second attention ends when something very important happens, something called the last judgment. This is the last time that we judge ourselves or anyone else. It’s the day we accept ourselves just the way we are and everyone else just the way they are. When the day of our last judgment comes, the war in our head is over and the dream of the third attention begins. We move from the dream of the warriors to the dream of the masters. This is a dream of truth and respect and joy. It is that point where we come back to our real state, our divine self, where we fell a communion of love with everything in existence. When we learn that the symbols are not the truth, then we are left to simply enjoy life, as we did before the symbols ruled us. We experience what he refers to as a resurrection, and it allows us to be wild and free like a child, except that we have freedom with wisdom instead of innocence. At this point we don’t need to judge ourselves or others, we don’t need to be right, nor prove others wrong, and we can express love with no shame or justification and walk in the world with our heart completely open. This is the goal– a life of joy.

These books express a philosophy couched in rather mystical terms–in dreams and symbols, attention and awareness. But its message seems quite similar to other philosophies and much that is discussed in the current realm of what I will call a new spirituality. It suggests a path to find our spiritual connectedness to all of the world around us, a realization that we are each a part of everything, and that everything is a part of us. It reveals truth as not as description or a concept, but something that simply is. As the author points out, the physical nature of a chair is truth–its name is just a symbol, a symbol that can take a myriad of forms. I think he feels that a concept like goodness is also a truth that is intrinsically recognized and internal, and not a product of a value system that is imposed on us by others. As is love, and beauty. As do many others, he lauds the innocence of childhood, a time when the truth is real before we become “domesticated”. He doesn’t condemn such domestication, he just says that it is because all of us have been indoctrinated and pass that knowledge on. But, at least to me, he doesn’t recognize such conditioning as being a necessary part of that portion of our lives when we must learn to cope in our world. I think that this is the message that Richard Rohr sends in “Falling Upward”. I can easily be misreading both, but, so be it.

The striking thing, as I read numerous books and other writings, and watch speeches, is the basic consistency in the message of oneness and the need to abandon, at least temporarily, much of what we have “learned” in order to open our minds, or perhaps clear our minds, so that we can receive the gift of interconnectedness. Whether this is termed as experiencing heaven, or nirvana, or “oneness” is of no consequence. These are just names for a realization of our humble and insignificant position in a broader, more accepting, and more loving world than most of us witness day to day.",positive
221,Books,The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom (A Toltec Wisdom Book),$7.74,5,"I should start off by stating my background. I am an undergrad student of philosophy and linguistics, a branch of the humanities. I also deeply love this series of books because of its obviousness and simplicity. It has personally helped me triumph over many, many challenges. This is why I decided to write a review here.

There is a huge tradition of skepticism in linguistics, especially about how language is used in various cultures to create belief systems. A belief system is basically a set of instructions inside your brain based on language. These instructions help you navigate the stressful world around you so you can survive. We are psychologically wired to think our belief systems are accurate and experience deep stress if we find them to be inaccurate.

The trouble is, our belief systems are ALWAYS inaccurate. Yes, I used the word ""always"" for a reason.

Without going deeply into the study of philosophy and linguistics, I will give you an overview here:

Philosophy - When you study philosophy, you study belief systems about how the world works and explore important questions like ""is there a God?"" or ""What is consciousness."" You may not be surprised to find out that philosophy majors have not come up with answers to these questions because there is always a case where we are going to be wrong or have a counter argument. Much of the study of philosophy is the collection of vocabulary words to describe beliefs. They even have a mathematical component called propositional logic, where one takes sentences and reduces them to symbols and creates ""proofs"" but even prop-logic is under fire from academics for its complete inability to predict anything. In other words, it isn't the answer either.

Linguistics - When you study words and language, you realize that all our beliefs are based on language and this language can never ""touch reality"" in that language is just an arbitrary description of reality, posing as real. I believe Miguel Ruiz must have taken a linguistics course as well--as his first agreement attests to the power of language. The four agreements pulls heavily from Saussure and Derrida. Both Saussure and Derrida (and many, many others) did work on how we form ideas in our heads based on language. The gist is this: we have something called a ""symbol"" in our brain which is composed of two parts: the word and the visual representation of the object (look up semiotics for further detail). These symbols are in our mind and work together to form meaning, then belief. The unfortunate thing is that they are entirely made up. It isn't real. Our ideas of it aren't real.

If you really want a deeper understanding on how linguistics has saturated our belief systems I recommend reading some of their academic essays or get Rivkin and Ryan's literary theory books. They are excellent and will take you further down the rabbit hole. Most of the essays are dense but worth the effort!

To simplify: scientists and academics in the millions have tried and tried and tried to find ""the true belief"" for thousands, maybe tens of thousands of years and we have not yet arrived at any truth. Because of domestication, we think other people have it, but they don't! ""Truth"" is defined as that which has the most predictive power. So far, mathematics, geometry, and physics has the most predictive power. Our belief systems simply do not.

So any beliefs about yourself can be true and they can also be false. We can't know. So why not pick something positive? If no one knows anything, then how can you even know anything?

But you don't need to study this yourself. All you have to do is think back to your past self, let's say ten years ago. Did that person have a belief system that you now consider to be faulty? How is that possible? What about your future self? Will that person believe you have a faulty belief system? Probably! How is this possible? How can you be SO WRONG? Is it because you ""haven't learned?"" I highly doubt it!

But we have to be right! We ARE RIGHT! At least we think we might be . . . maybe?

The need to be right is so ingrained within us that we create a huge drama when someone contradicts our beliefs. We end relationships over it! We storm out! We write angry twitter updates.

HOW THIS BOOK HAS PERSONALLY HELPED ME:

- No one person's opinion will ever again have the power to limit what I can do, even if this person is an authority figure
- No one group's opinion will ever again have the power to limit what I can do
- No one has a clear idea of who or what I am, not even me!
- When people talk, they are telling stories. I don't have to argue. I don't have to fight. I simply have to listen. WOW!
- I cannot comprehend another person's dream. I can't mind read. I can't assume. I know nothing of their inner workings.
- Even scary, aggressive people are just telling stories.
- I no longer have to feel ashamed about who I am or what I've done or where I'm going. It's not my job to assign a story to my life, or a judgment.
- I no longer have to pretend to be something or hustle to gain love. I just need to love who is willing to love back. It's so simple.
- I take all gurus, religions, indictments and gossip with quite a high level of benevolent skepticism, which allows me to be free from the fear that goes along with these stories.
- I don't take myself as seriously as I used to.

Probably the most valuable of all . . .

- I have a deep compassion for all people. We are all just stuck here together, trying our hardest and doing our best. I don't have to hate someone because their best wasn't up to some story I tell myself. I don't' have to insist they believe in my story. I can just smile and listen and do what I can.",positive
222,Books,The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom (A Toltec Wisdom Book),$7.74,4,"The book has the boldest of aspirations, attempting to be in the peer set of sacred religious foundations such as The Bible. The author believes we create our own hell and, through practicing the ""agreements"" in this book, could instead create our own heaven. The core idea of reframing your mental state is well studied and backed up by science, but the degree to which these agreements fulfill such lofty ambitious is an open question. My take is that there's some wisdom that anyone could benefit from, but there's a cloud of poor editing the reader must pass through to access it.

""The dream you are living is your creation. It is your perception of reality that you can change at any time. You have the power to create hell, and you have the power to create heaven.""

Agreement 1: Be Impeccable With Your Word
Similar to the Buddhist eightfold path ""right speech"". They mean speech that doesn't go against yourself. This is both negative self-talk as well as unkind words towards others, because that comes back against us
* If I see you in the street and I call you stupid, it appears that I’m using the word against you. But really I’m using my word against myself, because you’re going to hate me for this, and your hating me is not good for me.
* Using the analogy of the human mind as a computer, gossip can be compared to a computer virus. A computer virus is a piece of computer language written in the same language all the other codes are written in, but with a harmful intent. This code is inserted into the program of your computer when you least expect it and most of the time without your awareness. After this code has been introduced, your computer doesn’t work quite right.
* Impeccability of the word will also give you immunity from anyone putting a negative spell on you. You will only receive a negative idea if your mind is fertile ground for that idea.

Agreement 2: Don't Take Anything Personally.
Like David Foster Wallace's ""This is water"", we have a rather selfish view that the world revolves around us. Instead, we must love ourselves and refuse to take the ""poison"" others may inflict towards us.
* Even when a situation seems so personal, even if others insult you directly, it has nothing to do with you. What they say, what they do, and the opinions they give are according to the agreements they have in their own minds.
* Even the opinions you have about yourself are not necessarily true; therefore, you don’t need to take whatever you hear in your own mind personally.
* All the sadness and drama you have lived in your life was rooted in making assumptions and taking things personally.

Agreement 3: Don't Make Assumptions.
We view the actions of others through a filter. Instead, we can practice mindfulness and accept things as they are without associating baggage.
* We make assumptions about what others are doing or thinking — we take it personally — then we blame them and react by sending emotional poison with our word.
* We only see what we want to see, and hear what we want to hear. We don’t perceive things the way they are.

Agreement 4: Always Do Your Best.
In every moment, give it your best. Even the seemingly inconsequential you now give your all. But note this is not about perfection, we are human and can accept our actions as long as we try our best.
* When you overdo, you deplete your body and go against yourself, and it will take you longer to accomplish your goal. But if you do less than your best, you subject yourself to frustrations, self-judgment, guilt, and regrets.
* If you don’t judge yourself there is no way you are going to suffer from guilt, blame, and self-punishment.
* When you always do your best, you take action. Doing your best is taking the action because you love it, not because you’re expecting a reward.
* When you do your best you learn to accept yourself. But you have to be aware and learn from your mistakes. Learning from your mistakes means you practice, look honestly at the results, and keep practicing.
* You do your best because you want to do it, not because you have to do it, not because you are trying to please
* I make everything a ritual, and I always do my best. Taking a shower is a ritual for me, and with that action I tell my body how much I love it.

Quotes that provide a summary of the author's views
* The best way to say, “Thank you, God,” is by letting go of the past and living in the present moment, right here and now. Whatever life takes away from you, let it go.
* The real you is still a little child who never grew up. Sometimes that little child comes out when you are having fun or playing, when you feel happy, when you are painting, or writing poetry, or playing the piano, or expressing yourself in some way. These are the happiest moments of your life — when the real you comes out, when you don’t care about the past and you don’t worry about the future.
* Develop awareness of all the self-limiting, fear-based beliefs that make you unhappy.
* You achieve the Mastery of Transformation by changing the fear-based agreements that make you suffer, and reprogramming your own mind, in your own way.
* Going to the core of those agreements is what I call going into the desert. When you go into the desert you meet your demons face-to-face. After coming out of the desert, all those demons become angels.
* Happiness is a choice, and so is suffering.",positive

224,Books,The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom (A Toltec Wisdom Book),$7.74,5,"I've wanted to read this book for some time, and I'm sorry that I waited so long to do so. Reading this book and applying it to my life are two separate things. After reading the book, I have so many unanswered questions, but awareness is the first step to making these changes.

Four agreements, it sounds so simple, but I think it's hard to make these agreements, and I have a great deal of work before they become a part of my life.

Here are the four agreements:
- Be impeccable with your word.
- Don't take anything personally.
- Don't make assumptions.
- Always do your best.

Here's some of what I've personally gotten from each agreement:

Be Impeccable with Your Word
- Always say what you mean and mean what you say.
- What I say must represent my values and beliefs, not what I think others want to hear.

Don't Take Anything Personally
- Don't take ANYTHING, good or bad, personally.
- Whatever anyone says to me is their opinion and view of the world and represents what they are going through; it doesn't have anything to do with me.
- I shouldn't take what others say about me as the truth; I need to have my own opinion of myself, which needs to be rooted in reality.

Don't Make Assumptions
- I need to question things more often.
- Don't assume that what others tell me is the truth or correct; I need to discover the truth myself by questioning and searching for answers.

Always Do Your Best
- In every situation, do the best that I (and I emphasize the word ""I"") can do.
- What I am capable of doing changes from minute to minute. Each minute, I should do the best that I can do at that moment.
- I shouldn't compare myself to others; just do the best that I can do.

Some of my favorite highlights in the book include:
- ""We pretend to be what we are not because we are afraid of being rejected.""
- ""Even if the Book of Law [all the things the world around us has taught us] is wrong, it makes you feel safe.""
- ""Ninety-five percent of the beliefs we have stored in our minds are nothing but lies, and we suffer because we believe all these lies.""
- ""…our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive.""
- ""Humans punish themselves endlessly for not being what they believe they should be.""
- ""Nothing other people do is because of you. It is because of themselves.""
- ""Even opinions about yourself are not necessarily true; therefore, you don't need to take whatever you hear in your own mind personally.""
- ""We only see what we want to see and hear what we want to hear. We don't perceive things the way that they are.""
- ""If others change, it's because they want to change, not because you can change them.""
- ""If you do less than your best, you subject yourself to frustration, self-judgment, guilt, and regrets.""
- ""When you always do your best, you take action.""
- ""If you take action because you have to, then there is no way you are going to do your best.""
- ""Action is about fully living.""
- ""You can have many great ideas in your head, but what makes the difference is the action.""
- ""Not enjoying what is happening right now is living in the past and being only half alive.""
- ""Practice makes the master.""
- ""Repetition makes the master.""

I still have many unanswered questions, and I need to do much work to fully implement the things I've learned in this book. But I look forward to doing the work, making my life better, and clearing out a lot of the clutter in my mind.

Well…surprise surprise - Colleen Hoover did it again. Confess just devoured my heart…brain…soul…all of it was just sucked up into 320 pages of unputdownable bliss and I was simply helpless to the awesomeness. I’m not joking…I Could. Not. Put. This. Book. Down. I finished it in less than a day…I was captivated and entranced…possibly even hypnotized – I mean, we are talking about Colleen Hoover, the woman is a genius with words. I really don’t know what to do right now. I’m beside myself because I seriously am not ready to let go of these characters. Welcome to Book Hangover…party of me.

Auburn Mason Reed…well, this chick held my heart in the palm of her hand from basically the second paragraph and she never let go of it for one second. There is something about Auburn that pulls inexplicably at every single one of my heart strings. I want to comfort her…hug her…protect her…because she’s never had that. Life hasn’t been fair or kind to Auburn…and surprisingly you would think that would result in a negative attitude or a huge chip on her shoulder…but she takes everything in stride. She does what she needs to do and she makes the best of it…ignores the pain and the emptiness and just remains resolute on moving forward. That takes an enormous amount of self will and determination cause I’ll be honest, if I’d been through half of what she had…I can’t say I would have made it. I ached for Auburn to have some kind of peace…happiness…something just for herself because good Lord did she deserve it…and lucky for me she got all of that and more in the form of a gorgeous boy with beautiful green eyes.

‘“I’ve been wanting to do this since the moment I laid eyes on you,” he whispers. His mouth connects with mine, and at first his kiss is like the one I gave him in the tent. Soft, sweet, and innocent. But then the innocence is stripped away the second he runs one of his hands through the back of my hair and slides his tongue against my lips.
I don’t know how I can feel so light and so heavy all at once, but his kiss makes me feel weighted to a cloud. I slide my hands up his neck and do my best to kiss him the way he’s kissing me, but I’m afraid my mouth doesn’t even compare to his. There’s no way I could make him feel like he’s making me feel right now.’

Owen Mason Gentry…my sexy artist with a ginormous heart. Owen is…a lot of things…so many amazing things...where do I even begin. Well…he’s kind and generous...incredibly thoughtful…sweet and sincere…funny…charming…oh who am I kidding, he’s completely swoon-tastic. He has a cat – which in my book makes him awesome…plus he named it Owen…and it’s a she, really? I can’t even with how amazing he is. I already said he was an artist…but he’s also incredibly talented, which makes him 10 million times sexier, but what led him to painting and what he paints takes everything about his art to a whole new level. The confessions and what he does with them is…like giving a visual representation to a secret…a fear…an emotion…a dream. I mean…it’s truly a mind-blowing concept and something you just want to dive into headfirst and never re-surface. When I say Owen has a ginormous heart it might be the understatement of the year. I’ve never met someone more self-sacrificing…more giving…he never thinks of himself first and while he may not have a lot of people in his life, he would do anything for those he loves. And…lastly…the most amazing thing about Owen is that his initials are OMG. :-)

‘His mouth meets mine again, and he lands a kiss as soft as velvet against my lips. He slowly moves his head until his mouth is directly over my ear. “Is this it? Is this how it ends?”
I nod, even thought it’s the last thing I want to do. But this is the end. Even if he were to change his life completely, his past choices still affect my own life.
“Sometimes we don’t get second chances, Owen. Sometimes things just end.”
He winces. “We didn’t even get a first chance.”’

I loved everything about these two. From the moment they locked eyes I had a smile on my face and even through every angsty second I could not help but fall more in love with every little nuisance that was revealed. From the same middle names…to all the different ways they connected…they just got each other and I felt every second of their connection. I reveled in it…and considering the way Auburn and Owen’s relationship develops, that speaks volumes. I’ve always said that if I can feel the emotions from the characters...nothing else matters…so when it was actually brought up how many days they had spent together, I kinda had to do a double take because it felt like so much longer. They had this brilliant chemistry…it was effortless, the way everything was blended together just aligned perfectly and I really fell hard for these two, my heart simply overflows with love and adoration for Auburn and Owen.

‘“You’re being unfair.”
“No, I’m being selfish,” he says.
“It’s the same thing.”
He takes a step toward me. “No, Auburn, it isn’t. Unfair would be giving you an ultimatum. Being selfish is doing something like this.” His lips connect with mine with strength and purpose. His hands slide into my hair and wrap around the back of my head. He kisses me like he’s giving me every kiss he wishes he could have given me in the past, and every kiss he’ll wish he could give me in the future.
All of them, all at once.
His hands drop to my back and he pulls me against him. I’m not sure where my hands are at this point. I think I’m holding on to him for dear life, but every part of me other than my mouth has just gone completely numb. The only thing I’m fully aware of is his mouth on mine. His kiss is all I know in this moment.
All I want to think about.’

This plot…gah…it’s not called Confess for nothing…so many secrets…so many little details…so many things that could be spoiled…hence the reason why I’m not really talking about it. I’ll be honest, it wasn’t too difficult to figure out what the secrets were that they were keeping…but it really didn’t matter - that didn’t make me want to hear it directly from the characters any less. And trust me knowing the secrets beforehand did not change the emotional impact it had on me when the truth finally came out. There’s a million different ways to write a heart wrenching scene…but I promise you, Colleen has a direct line to whatever controls my tears…because she nails it every time. I mean I knew when I was crying two pages in on the prologue this book was going to be a doozy, but I was blown away. It was everything I needed…the entire emotional rollercoaster set to level 10 – and maybe it was because I was so connected and invested in these characters but I felt everything so deeply and I couldn’t stop loving it. I guess that my only complaint would be the ending, it felt a little…abrupt. I have come to expect a full story…a complete experience…and not that I didn’t love the insight that we get after the final chapter (I truly loved it)…I guess I was expecting an epilogue or maybe a little bit more closure. After I sat back and thought about it…I was fine with the ending…I don’t have to have everything spelled out for me, but I guess I was just a little surprised.

‘“I’ll take whatever you’re willing to give me. Because I know that if you walk out that door, then ten years from now…twenty years from now…we’ll wish we had listened to our hearts when we think back on tonight.”
“That’s what scares me,” I tell him. “I’m afraid if I listen to my heart once, I’ll never figure out how to ignore it again.”
Owen lowers his mouth to mine, and in a whisper he says, “If only I could be so lucky.” His mouth connects with mine again, and this time I’m very aware of every part of me. I’m pulling him to me with as much desperation as he’s pulling at me. His mouth is everywhere as he kisses me with relief, knowing this kiss is me agreeing to whatever he’s asking of me. It’s my way of telling him he can have tonight.’

Confess is a classic example of why Colleen Hoover is an absolute must read for me…her books demand to be read because they’re just excellence personified. She has this unique capability to create characters that steal my heart...compel every emotion out of the spectrum…concocts unique and original plots…and then packages it all up nicely with writing that blows my mind. I don’t even know how to explain it and do it any sort of justice. Her dialogue is some of the best that I’ve ever read…she is able to infuse the deepest emotions into the most simple of things – in fact everything she writes feels like it just bleeds emotion, and that might be why her books are like crack to me. She can have me dying laughing and bawling crying, sometimes all in the same chapter…heck it could be in the same paragraph…and while her books are no where near erotic, she’s still able to make things sexy and give you those feelings without taking it to that level. Plus anyone that can work the line ‘Texas is turning me into a whore.’ into a book…is seriously a genius.",positive
231,Books,Confess: A Novel,$11.43,5,"Loved this book! I loved the aspect of the anonymous confessions art studio. I absolutely loved Owen Gentry's personality and how well he treated Auburn. I hated seeing Auburn go through struggles over getting custody of her son, AJ, who she had at a young age. She is constantly fighting Lydia, her dead boyfriend's mother, just to see her son. She finds out Owen was arrested for possession. So, she decides to distance herself from him to give her the best shot of getting custody of her boy.Then in walks Trey, Lydia's other son, telling Auburn if she decides to be with him, they can be like a family, her, him, and AJ. Auburn decides to give this a chance since she will do anything to be with her boy. However, Trey does not spark the fire that Owen does. She tries with Trey though, but when he finds out she still wants Owen, he goes crazy and assaults her. Owen gets out of jail and eventually confesses that he was not in possession, but that when Trey pulled him and his dad over, he suggested Owen take the blame for the pills so that Owen's dad's law career wouldn't be ruined. Auburn finds this out and can't believe it. The next thing we know, Trey breaks into Owen's studio and vandalizes everything. He then breaks in again and try to assault Auburn again but Owen punches him. Trey arrests Owen for assault of an officer. However, while they are all in the car on the way to the station, Auburn records Trey confessing what he did and she shows this to Owen's dad and they are able to use it as leverage to get Lydia to sign over custody of AJ or else Auburn will release this recording to everyone in Owen's precinct. We then learn how Owen knew Auburn this whole time. When she was younger and in the hospital with her now dead boyfriend, Owen was in the room next door with his father in a comatose state due to a wreck in a car Owen was driving. He saw Auburn day in and day out and was envious of the love her and Adam shared. Owen told Adam one day that he thought it was crazy that he and Auburn had the same middle name and Adam said ""maybe that's fate"" and Owen said ""I'm pretty sure what you both have is fate"". Adam then said ""I'm praying she gets more than one fate"". Such a powerful emotional story. Of course we see that Owen, Auburn, and AJ all end up together!",positive
232,Books,Confess: A Novel,$11.43,5,"THE STORY:

Becca: I actually went into Confess completely blind, having read the synopsis quite some time ago I decided to avoid reading anything else so that I could go in with an open mind and no premonition of what was to come. Besides knowing that it would have something do with Art I was clueless. That is my favorite way to go into a book (movies too!) This approach really worked with how Colleen Hoover built this story. Bits and pieces about both main characters lives are introduced throughout the story until at the end we have a complete picture of not only their past, present and future, but also a clear picture of who both Owen and Auburn are. I really cannot reveal too much about the story without spoiling it, but I will see that as things were revealed Lisa and I were texting back and forth “OMG!” and then “OMG AGAIN!!” (and by the way for those who have read this.. pun intended on the OMG!) Oh and by the way… that prologue?! It is one of the most beautiful things I have ever read, it sets the tone for the entire story and once I read that I was completely hooked! I was so enraptured by Confess that I did not want to put it down! Once again Colleen Hoover has worked her epic, magic, writing genius and my love her has grown grown even more!

“I love you so much.” His voice is breathless and full of fear. “I’ll love you forever. Even when I can’t.” My tears fall harder at his words. “And I’ll love you forever. Even when I shouldn’t.”

Lisa: CoHo, you can do no wrong in my eyes. You continue to blow me away with your creative writing style, insanely gorgeous words, and knack for pulling your readers in instantly and never letting go.

Becca’s definitely right about that prologue. It was so, so beautiful. Sweet, and sad, and definitely set the stage for story. Like Becca, I went into this story with no idea whatsoever about what I was going to encounter. I rarely read descriptions, so this is the norm for me. I just love going into a story with a blank slate. And with Colleen especially, this always pays off. The way she tells a story with so many questions, then revealing bits and pieces throughout, is one of my very favorite things about her. It definitely encourages the “I cannot stop reading!!!” behaviors we all struggle with from time to time. ;)

She’s like a light, unwittingly brightening up the darkest corners of a man’s soul.

THE CHARACTERS:

Lisa: This beautiful story is told through the alternating points of view of both Auburn and Owen. (Oh, how I love me some dual narration!!) Auburn has relocated recently, living with a girl she just met in a small apartment near the salon where she works. She has her entire life planned out for her… minus the part where she needs more money. And fast. She stumbles upon an art studio looking for an assistant where she can make some major money, so she immediately agrees to the job. This is where she meets Owen, the studio’s owner. Owen was a bit of an enigma at first. Even though we have the pleasure of his voice for a lot of the book, at the beginning I wasn’t quite sure on how I felt about him. He had a few secrets, and I unsure of whether I would want to smack him or hug him as the story progressed.

This is one of the things I love most about Colleen Hoover and her ninja writing skills… so many secrets that really keep you guessing until they are finally revealed… and then… SO MANY FEELS! Good feels, bad feels, ugly feels… she brings them all out of me! Oh, Colleen… how you torture me so!

Owen smiles, and I suddenly wish we were in the cleaning aisle, because someone is going to have to mop me up off this floor.

Becca: So many feels is right and this book had them all! I would go from grinning, to crying and then to irrationally angry as I read! But these were all good things because each emotion was an integral part of the story!

I liked Auburn a lot, she was so strong and her perseverance was one of the things I loved the most about her! As I learned more about her, my heart went out to her. She worked so hard for everything and never gave up on what she wanted, no matter how hard it was.

Lisa is right about Owen, I wasn’t too sure about him either. My head couldn’t decided if it should trust him, but my heart was screaming at me to do so! His creative mind was absolutely beautiful! The way that he thought and spoke was as if his words were painted with colors and it was magical. The art work/paintings are such a major part of this book. Because we had an E-ARC we did not get to see the paintings and it made me so sad :( Luckily, I received my pre-order in the mail shortly after finishing and I immediately searched through to re-read the passages and look at te art work… OMG the paintings are AMAZING!!!!! I seriously just stared at them and petted them while my brain soaked them in! By the way, the Artist’s name (not it’s not Owen LOL) is Danny O’Connor :D

I tilt my face toward her neck and inhale the scent of her. If her smell had a color, it would be pink. Sweet and innocent with a touch of roses.

OVERALL:

Becca: Once again, Colleen Hoover has amazed me! She is so talented and her writing speaks to my soul. I will continue to devour any and everything that she writes because her ability to incorporate real characters and beautiful stories packed with so many feels keeps me coming back for more! I had a serious book hangover after reading Confess, I was still so in love with Auburn and Owen and the amazing art that I had to give my brain and heart time to recuperate! If you have not read this yet, DO IT! Trust me, I don’t think that you will be disappointed!

Lisa: As I’ve said before and will continue to say, I always rate books based on how they make me feel, and not necessarily on any technical aspects. Because of this, I have zero hesitation about rating this book a full 5 stars. I loved it. From page one I connected with this book, and it never faltered. I’m continually blown away by Colleen Hoover’s talent in writing such realistic and shockingly-defined stories. Her mind is a powerful tool, and I feel lucky to have the chance to experience it when reading her books. Once again, Colleen has made me feel things. ALL the things. And I couldn’t be happier. If you enjoy Colleen’s books (Are there really people out there that DON’T enjoy her books?!) this is one you will not want to miss!",positive
233,Books,Confess: A Novel,$11.43,4,"Another CoHo down! I enjoyed reading this book but I also realize that it was probably my least favorite of hers. I I still connected with the characters but I’m not even sure how to describe what didn’t feel quite right. That being said, Auburn and Owen were intriguing characters to get to know. One of the things I enjoyed about reading the physical copy is that they were actual inserts of Owen’s art pieces! So beautiful!

As I’m ready in this, I think one of the reasons why this book made me feel as uncomfortable as it did is because the antagonists were so realistic. As you read, it becomes pretty clear who they are but in case you’re thinking about reading Confess, I won’t say because it’ll add to the mystery of the book.

234,Books,Confess: A Novel,$11.43,4,"“Some secrets should never turn into confessions. I know that better than anyone.”

As any Colleen Hoover fan out there, I was so excited when these arrived at my doorstep, but then afraid to open it because I knew it would break my heart all over again. And I tell you, it didn’t disappoint. I was heartbroken, not even five minutes into the book and not even through the prologue yet.

I was contemplating on continuing reading cause some of the first words you’ll see are “Part One” and I was like, “does this end in a cliffhanger?” because I couldn’t take cliffhangers, especially if the release dates are so far apart. Lucky for all of us, it is a standalone. :)

“In order to be embarrassed, a person has to care about the opinions of others first.”

There are a lot of things I liked about this book.

First, the art. The art here are just lovely and to incorporate the art into the story and really show what it looked like brought in a lot more emotion and understanding of each of the confessions or inspiration behind them.

“Surface friends” is what I call it. When your friendship is merely a facade and you’re enemies on the inside.

Then there were the confessions. The book said that all these confessions were real, and I couldn’t believe it at first, but when I think about all these confessions some more, I see why the need to use real confessions rather than make up some. It makes people connect more with the story and realistically, makes you feel that kind of “normalcy” that Auburn felt when she first read those. “If these are all true, then maybe my life isn’t quite as bad as I think it is.”

And then there are the characters and the witty banters. I had mixed emotions regarding Auburn. I don’t know if I like her that much cause I didn’t like how she did and thought about a few things, but I do know I wanted to throttle her for most part of the book. I mean, I get her situation and all, but couldn’t she think of a better solution, a more long-term one rather than succumbing to the demands of others all the time? I don’t like pushover characters, and for the most part, in this book, she was one. She also frustrated me to the point of taking breaks in between a few later chapters because she was indecisive and just seems to be settling in with what she had. :(

“I think love is a hard word to define. You can love a lot of things about a person but still not love the whole person.“

Owen. What can I say? He was a dream! I was bracing myself for that confession he was going to say, it turns out it wasn’t that big. That major secret I thought would blow my mind just earned him brownie points in my book. Really, he was just being this caring and helpful son and that doesn’t make his confession against him at all. And if the major secret is the one involved with Adam, I admit that was a total mind-fuck moment but in a really wonderful way. I really loved Owen, and the depth of how he cared about Auburn and his love for her and his family… *sigh*

Confession: I didn’t like Auburn that much (and this is probably the reason of the rating below) but Owen makes up for her character. I think the ending is not really an ending and I’d like to read maybe a novella of what happened to their relationship after all those issues cast aside. I’d like to think Trey would want revenge on both of them, and I would really like it if both Trey and his mother would pay for the years of mental abuse they did.

“… but sometimes in order to save a relationship, you have to sacrifice it first.”

The concepts of family, love and most of all, fate. The concept of family was a tricky one. Here on one side, we see a sort of messed up group of people who thinks a lot of themselves and shows love only to their family by blood. On another side, we see Auburn who is less confident and is trying to go after the only family member she has in Texas because she left her siblings and her parents in another part of the country. And to the side, we see Owen struggling and basically doing everything he can to maintain a relationship with the only family member he has left. It’s mind boggling, ironic, and really sad.

“Selflessness. It should be the basis of every relationship. If a person truly cares about you, they’ll get more pleasure from the way they make you feel, rather than the way you make them feel.”

Love. As romantic stories go, this was mostly predictable. I did think of a few things the story could go over in my head while reading chapters and I am happy to say I did predict a few outcomes, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It’s just maybe, I’m used to being surprised by this author that I didn’t see that coming. So yeah, surprised maybe a word for it after all. :)

Lastly, fate. I am one of those people who, like most, believe in this kind of thing. If it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be, right? I loved the concept of fate here. Wherein she had one past lover who maybe brought her together with her second fate. It’s hard to understand this concept and I am really happy that it was so easily shown in this book. “If we’re meant to be together and fate really does exist, maybe one of these days she’ll wind up at my door.” You may not understand it, you may not know how it came about, you may not have a valid reason for any of it- it’s just that when it happens, “that could be fate, you know”. That, in itself, is beautiful.

With it’s realistic portrayal of life, family, death, love and fate, Confess will most definitely reel you in, make you laugh, make you wonder, break your heart and leave you breathless.

238,Books,Confess: A Novel,$11.43,5,"Colleen Hoover is back with another beautifully written book, she really has perfected her craft.She has really has perfected writing beautiful characters with tragic pasts, that's pretty much her ""thing"". Colleen writes it in a way that you don't end up feeling completely depressed after learning their ""secrets"". I really appreciate that about her,that she can write drama and pain without making my chest hurt with anxiety pains. I really genuinely hope she writes forever. :)

Let me start off with my synopsis of the Confess:
Our main characters are Auburn and Owen.
Auburn at her young age she has lost everything important to her, she knows what needs to be done to rebuild her life and she won't let anything get in her way of that.Even if that means cutting Owen out of her life completely.
Owen as well knows exactly how it feels to lose everything you care about. The last thing he wants to lose is Auburn. He's an Artist who uses the theme of Confessions. Anonymous people leave their confessions for him, now it's his turn to confess.
(I'm ending my synopsis there because I'm really struggling with not posting spoilers.)

Let's talk about the gorgeous cover because I move on to the actual review :)
I really love the whole artsy vibe, and the color choices were beautiful. . The paint,colors and art theme on front instead of having people on the cover was a very smart choice. Different, but I love it.

Like always I'm going to start with the positive things about Confess ( or my favorite things about it).

The Anonymous confessions!!! OH MY GOD, some of them were so incredibly sad,but some were really great.
""Every day I’m grateful that my husband and his brother look exactly alike. It means there’s less of a chance that my husband will find out that our son isn't his."".
The whole idea of strangers leaving their confessions in a box for Owen is an interesting concept.

I of course was crying within five minutes of reading this book,just so many emotions were felt in the prologue alone.So I was very anxious to see what had become of Auburn.
From the the moment Auburn appears on the page, she had me. We meet her when she's 15/16, the love that she shows in a time of tragedy is so beautiful.The fact that she is able to go on with her life after such a great loss, on top of other radical changes in her life, is inspiring to say the least. I believe most if not all of us can relate to her in some way. We all go through trials and tests of our strength throughout our lives, finding your purpose in the end is what's important. Auburn knows her purpose, she never falters from it, she never loses track of her goals. Even with Auburn and Owens immediate connection, her goals come first,no matter what. As someone who's been through her far share of crap, I really respected her.

Another thing I loved was Auburn and Owens instant connection.It was undeniable and powerful, there was no way they would've been able to ignore it.It really hurt my heart that Auburn had to cut Owen out, understandable but heartbreaking none the less.
I just flat out loved Owen,literally everything about him.

He's an Artist with his work .We quickly learn that both characters have their own confessions.
I loved Owens passion,his strength,and the sacrifices he makes for the ones he cares about. Despite the past he struggles in letting go of, he seems like a genuine good guy, he just sometimes goes about things in the wrong way. I also really enjoyed how he talked about Auburn, with genuine affection, and never negative toward or about her. It was as if he genuinely respected her, it wasn't all about sex for him. I believe for him he really needed to get over his guilt over his past. Holding onto that guilt was just causing him to enable certain people and their screw ups. I understand sacrifice but he really to learn the difference between what's worth the sacrifice and what's not.
“She deserves better. So much better.She deserves me.If only she knew that.”

I just had to do happy dances whenever he said such heartfelt things,

If you've read my reviews before this, then you know how much I love dual point of views. I believe having dual narration really helps you get to know the characters. You're better able to understand their reasoning behind their pain and decisions better. It's hard for me to relate to both of characters when I'm only getting one perspective, so I seriously appreciate getting both POV. Colleen is one of the few others authors that I really succeeds at writing both male and female perspectives realistically.

What I wasn't too crazy about was that I felt like the secret Owen was keeping was a little hyped up. It was a big deal of course, but I personally didn't feel like it was relationship altering. I'm sure many people will disagree, it's just my opinion. I don't feel like that lessened the story for me, it's just something that annoyed be a bit.
I do wish we were given a flash forward chapter at the end,I always appreciate those. I still loved the ending, I just would have enjoyed a little something from the future. I'm such a brat I guess haha.

I think that's all I can say about the book without giving too much of the plot away. All in all Confess was a beautiful book. I recommend it to anyone who loves a story about people working to overcome some rough s***.",positive

260,Books,The Silent Patient,$11.91,5,"“We're all crazy, I believe, just in different ways.”

What's a book that you've read because everyone else was reading it? I've been reading a book a week for the last ten years, and every once in a while a title comes along that everyone, from seasoned book reviewers to friends who rarely read, agrees must be read. Over the years those titles have included Gone Girl, Ready Player One, The Hunger Games, The Midnight Library, and countless more. The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides has been on that list since it was published in 2019. I tend to wait a bit before reading mega-hyped books, so it isn't uncharacteristic that I've waited this long to read this one. Now that I've read it, I finally see what all the hype is about.

Gabriel's murder was a pretty open and closed case. The evidence against his wife Alicia was insurmountable. Responding officers found her clad in all white, the gun used to put five rounds into Gabriel's face resting at her feet. What went wrong with the happy couple? She was a successful artist, the rare individual whose creativity combined with business savvy to turn her passion into a lucrative career. He was an equally thriving fashion photographer, the perfect match for his talented wife. Despite all of the evidence that Alicia killed her husband, investigators are unable to ascertain one final piece of the puzzle. Why did Alicia murder Gabriel? They can't expect an answer any time soon. Alicia hasn't spoken a word since that night.

Theo is a young psychotherapist trying to find his place in his new job at a secure psychiatric facility. He's intrigued by Alicia, who has been living in the facility ever since she was deemed unfit to stand a fair trial. He hasn't been officially assigned to work with her, but the puzzle of her case is something he is unable to ignore. As he navigates the perils of being the new guy in a place filled with peers who seem more inclined to further their own careers than to actually help their patients, Theo does everything he can to put himself in contact with the facility's most infamous charge. With enough time and access, Theo believes he can be the one to unlock her mind and find out just exactly what happened to bring her to this place.

After reading The Silent Patient for myself, it is easy to see why the book has resonated with so many readers. Michaelides has written the kind of compulsively readable novel that contains all of the elements that I crave in a psychological thriller. His plot is efficient in its simplicity. One character is locked away in her own mind while the other attempts to unlock it. Shifting points of view between the two characters give the reader insight into each one while methodically revealing bits of information that ramp up the suspense and drive the plot forward. Michaelides steers the reader through the labyrinth-like narrative he's constructed, allowing us to attach to his characters while leading us to misdirection after misdirection. It all culminates in a climactic twist that not only shocked me but impressed me with the precision with which it was delivered. The Silent Patient has the goods. It is a complex narrative with a propulsive plot, provocative mystery, and empathetic characters that all come together into an expertly crafted read.",positive
261,Books,The Silent Patient,$11.91,5,"I’m so glad our book club picked The Silent Patient for this month’s book! It was such an engaging and fast read! I couldn't put it down, and I have a really hard time staying engaged with anything that isn’t YA. I don’t typically read mystery or thriller books either because they can be kind of gruesome. Obviously, there is a murder but it wasn’t over the top in blood and violence. We have some pretty conservative members in our book group and no one really has any objections. It’s more psychologically twisty though there was definitely some sex scenes.

I thought the ending was great! It gave us lots to talk about, and I didn’t see it coming at all. Theo and Alicia were captivating narrators. Good characters are a must in books. I don’t typically like unreliable narrators because I just don’t like them and then can’t get into the story (ex. Girl on a Train), but I liked Theo. I feel like I can’t talk a lot about everything without giving things away!",positive
262,Books,The Silent Patient,$11.91,5,"The Silent Patient is Alex Michaelides debut psychological thriller has been on my TBR list since December of 2019 – finally I got to see what all the hype was all about.

Criminal psychotherapist, Theo Faber, is obsessed with Alice Berenson and captivated with the story as to why Alicia has murdered her husband. Both Alicia and her husband Gabriel are artist – she an artist extraordinaire he a well-known fashion photographer. She is found holding a gun, he is found shot in the face .. 5 time. What has driven Alicia to this point of killing her husband in such a brutal manner? But Alicia isn’t telling us because she has gone silent and for the past 6 years, she has been in a place called The Grove, a mental institution. Theo is presented with an opportunity to switch jobs and work with Alicia, determined to unravel the story behind the mystery behind this violent crime. As Alicia’s story is revealed, it takes Theo down some unexpected paths leading him into unanticipated turn of events that the search for the truth is starting to consume him.

For a debut novel, Alex Michaelides wrote an intriguing psychological suspense novel with brilliantly written characters. While the plot of the novel is not a fast-paced, the short chapters had me wanting to turn the page to read what Theo had uncovered. While I had some suspicion the ending was truly mind blowing. I will be thinking about all the dots the author planted.",positive
263,Books,The Silent Patient,$11.91,5,"I never write book reviews, but this book was crazy good. The plot twists had me running around in circles trying to figure it out, but in the end I was totally shocked!! I have never read a book before with this kind of ending. One that was so unexpected and shocking it took me awhile to figure it all out in my head. And now I want to reread it knowing how it ends and see how it all came together! I cannot say how much I adored this book! I'd give it ten stars if I could! Run and buy this book. You will not regret it!!",positive
264,Books,The Silent Patient,$11.91,5,"Once I started this book I finished it in minimal sittings. The beginning is confusing but push through it & you get these detailed, vivid stories of relationships & how powerful emotions are… the unspeakable things one may do after having their feelings torn apart. Classic human behavior. I love the inclusion of Greek mythology along with the psych/mental health aspects of the story. The end will blow your mind away! After I finished this book, I just sat there in complete shock, totally mind blowing! They need to make this a movie… yesterday!!",positive
265,Books,The Silent Patient,$11.91,2,"This is a read that I was thrilled about. It’s everywhere- on Tiktok, on Instagram, on Facebook- everyone talks about their recent reads and this book always seems to be in that list. I’ve heard glowing reviews, excitement to read it, and hype up to the max degree. Which is why my review is a dismal 2/5 stars, as it didn’t live up to the hype, and in fact, it horrifies me that so many people enjoyed this novel.

At first, I found myself perplexed by the tone of the novel. It felt less like I was reading a mental health professional, and more like I was reading an old detective novel. What should have been a read that sucked me in and went quickly, was instead painfully slow. I felt the book crawling, and found the writing to be dry, rife with short statement sentences that made the music of the book tonally flat. I haven’t read anything else by Alex Michaelides- though The Maidens is in my TBR list- and I don’t know if this is the author’s voice, or if it’s just this particular novel’s tone, but it was thoroughly unenjoyable and I found myself waiting for it to pick up.

Finally, it did- at least I thought so. We got into more character development, more from Alicia’s perspective, but… this is where I found the most fault. The formatting of this novel is downright bizarre: Each part resets the count of the chapters, which was aggravating to say the least. That is a method I’ve seen used in non-fiction but never in fiction, and I found myself irritated. Not only that, but throughout the novel are Alicia’s “diary entries”, bits of story told from her perspective. But this pissed me off! They are titled diary entries, and she even explains she’s writing down her thoughts: But they’re written like scenes. Many of them contain full back and forth dialogue, with perfect recollection. I would have rather seen them just as they were: Alicia’s point of view scenes. Having them be “diary entries” was angering, because they weren’t. Diary entries, when written by a character, are not written in this way. I found it distracting, taking me out of the book and unable to connect with Alicia. The wonky formatting did nothing but lower my opinion of this book, and make it impossible to relax into the novel.

As the book went on, I became increasingly aware of two more things I despised: The way mental health is handled, for one, and sexual commentary through Alicia’s point of view, for another. On the first point, this is a book steeped in mental health, with most of the cast of characters being therapists or doctors- or having mental health issues. Some areas are done well, but some are done so horribly that it makes me shudder to think of people reading this book and taking this portrayal as fact. The opinion of main character Theo regarding the patients at The Grove can sometimes be not only ignorant, but offensive. I think a lot of the mental health related moments in this book are poorly researched, or just poorly presented. As for my second point: Moments where Alicia described her husband, and her feelings for him, were often cringeworthy to read. She was written with this idolization of him, this passionate desire for him in perfectly normal, everyday situations. It was as if reading one of those internet memes about “men writing women”. I think it was unappealing, poorly done, and bordering on unrealistic. I found myself wondering why the abrupt sexual commentary was in this book at all- because it popped up more than once.

The one decent thing I can say about this story is that it has all the beats of a good story- even if they’re poorly done. There are decent bits of character descriptions when they get introduced, the story idea is solid, and there were some parts that weren’t so bad.

But the way this story is told was horrendous. Shifting timelines lead to a really big payoff to the mystery- but only if you don’t figure it out before you get there, and unfortunately, there were some fairly big tells for the end if you are an experienced reader of thrillers, or if you were paying enough attention. Not only that, but there are some storylines that go unanswered, and they feel like they were just there to distract and trick. I felt like the end reveal was the focus and everything that led up to it was just meant to be a distraction, instead of a real part of the story. It was annoying to see all these ideas go nowhere.

Most of all, the thing that infuriated me the most was that the entire book is about one simple question. Why is Alicia silent- why doesn’t she talk? Only, the answer to this is not a good one. It’s deeply metaphoric, surrounded by a Greek myth, full of intrigue- but the payoff is so poor, and it leaves a lot to be desired. The most important aspect of this book, and it’s utterly disappointing.

Overall, this book is probably a 3/5. But I chose to give it a 2/5 because of my struggle to get through it, and my disappointment in comparison to the hype. I regret wasting my time reading it. I write about mental health all the time- so to see this book, a poor excuse for representation, get so much undeserved hype makes me all the more upset. This is a slow, agonizing read that made me grit my teeth, and I hope those who read it are not easily fooled by the tricks that cover up what is an amazing plot turned into mush by poor writing.",negative

270,Books,Regretting You,$10.84,4,"I won't lie. I did enjoy this book, but it has definitely been my least favorite CoHo book so far. It was a good story with a decent twist about a seemingly perfect family destroyed in the span of a night. Morgan and Chris have the seemingly perfect life, with daughter Clara in tow. They are bound and determined to make sure Clara never repeats the mistakes they made when they were her age. Then, one night, Morgan gets a call saying that Chris has been in an accident and has been taken to the hospital. She immediately rushes there. When she gets there, Jonah (her and Chris's friend), arrives soon after. She then questions how he even knew about the wreck, and he says ""What are you talking about, Morgan? I am here because I was called and told that Jenny (his wife and Morgan's sister) had been in a wreck."" This takes the story into the spiral of ""why were our significant others together, when Jenny told us the night before that she had been at work"". They end up finding out that they had been headed to stay at a hotel together that day when they were in the wreck. Jenny and Chris both die as a result of the wreck. When Jonah and Morgan find out that they had been sneaking around behind their backs, they are crushed. Morgan takes refuge in the arms of Jonah, the man who she has always loved, and who she would have probably married instead of Chris, had they not gotten pregnant with Clara first. When Clara sees Morgan and Jonah kissing one night, she is immediately angry. She then finds out the truth of the situation and comes to accept their new relationship. While all this is happening, Clara has a budding romance with Miller Adams. He has been in love with her for years now, but has kept it hidden. The whole time, Clara has thought he hated her because of the way he avoided her. When they finally get together though, they fall so deeply in love and he helps her through the stuff with her family. Again, overall good family book, but just didn't blow me away like all of her other novels have. Can't wait to read my next novel by her!",positive
271,Books,Regretting You,$10.84,4,"Ok, overall I thought it was a good story. I liked the back and forth perspective from both the mother & daughter dealing with loss, betrayal, and questioning love… the story tore my heart a few times and I just felt so much need for this to end up with the happiest ending ever to even it out. But like many of Colleen’s books, the ending is a bit rushed and doesn’t give me full closure from the complete bloody massacre the earlier chapters had on my feels…

SPOILER WARNING!!!!

People might disagree with me, but Morgan needed to open those letters her husband had from her sister. She needed to know the true extent of the affair. Was it just sexual? Were they in love? How long had it gone on? Were there feelings of guilt? Did they try to stop?….I’m trying to wrap my head around the author’s premise that she was stronger now and didn’t need to know what had happened. Umm, I call bulls**t.
Developing the character from someone who was oblivious to things and was walked all over by everyone close to her doesn’t mean she hides from the truth and is too afraid to open those letters and just decides to move on. Nope. Nope. That’s a case of denial, not strength. True character strength/growth would be her willing to know the truth and THEN saying—it can’t hurt me, they can’t hurt me anymore, and then go embrace a new start.
You realize about 30% into the book that this woman needs some major therapy, but she hides. If Morgan was my friend, I’d smack her upside the head, shake her and tell her that at some point in her life she needs to stop avoiding the truth/pain. Embrace the scars of what people did to you to truly become someone who is a survivor. Someone who can say—this is what really happened, the whole ugly truth, and not only didn’t it break me, but I’m happier now than ever. I hope if there are real women who read this book who are living this situation in life—they don’t follow this example.",positive
272,Books,Regretting You,$10.84,5,"I definitely feel like this is one of Colleen's underrated books, I'll be honest I didn't expect much out of it (idky I just didn't), but let me just say I loved it. I feel like Morgan was trying so hard to keep the awful truth from her daughter, Clara, so she wouldn't think differently of her Dad and Aunt. All Morgan wanted to do was keep her daughter from hurting, and to keep her from making the same mistakes that she did at her age. For that I did not like Clara, I felt like she wasn't trying to be understanding of her mother and was being a real brat but I guess that's what its like to be 16. Despite her mother's initial thoughts, Miller was good for Clara, he was there for her even when she was acting like a brat (trying to keep it PG) not only to her mother but also to him. Miller didn't deserve that, but he understood her grief. Now, don't even get me started on Morgan and Jonah because OMG I am so happy that through everything they been through, they were able to end up together. 💛",positive

I like the sense of humor used with Miller. I like that they had some deep routed issues and were not perfect people.",positive
274,Books,Regretting You,$10.84,4,"When my favorite authors have new books that come out, I try my best to go in as blind as I can. No reading the blurb. Skipping over reviews online and teasers in book groups. It's hard, but I want to experience the book without ANY preconceived notions and be surprised on my own. Regretting You was a beautiful surprise from an author that can write absolutely anything (but what is up with her use of letters in so many books?? lol).

Regretting You is told in dual POV from a mother (Morgan) and daughter (Clara). They've experienced something that was life altering and the experience changed them and their whole life forever.

""Right after something tragic happens, you feel like you've fallen off a cliff. But after the tragedy starts to sink in, you realize you didn't fall off a cliff. You're on an eternal roller coaster that just reached the bottom. Now it's gonna be up and down and upside down for a long , long time. Maybe even forever.""

And that's what this story was for me. It unfolded and we got to see how 2 characters handled the situation. Neither one was perfect. A mother trying to shield her daughter and protect her, while at the same time trying to forge and fix the relationship between them that had floundered in recent years. Morgan gave up absolutely everything for Clara and, being a teen, she never saw it. Morgan was selfless and that was her biggest flaw. She did for others at the detriment to herself.
And then there's Clara. She is a teenager and that's almost the only thing we need to say to understand her actions. She is trying to navigate a new life and holds so much hatred toward her mother that just wants a relationship with her. But she also has a boy around her that intrigues her (Miller, FTW). Her actions are all over the place. These three characters and their roller coaster of emotions had me feeling for them all throughout the book.

I hate a review that gives me a synopsis of a book. So I will leave you with this...
Regretting You gives you two female characters that are trying to figure out their places in life and their places with each other. It's not easy to read everything and you will want to smack Clara a few times. But like I said, she's a teenager that's been dealt a blow. And even Morgan is frustrating. Especially in the flashbacks where maybe she got it wrong.
Miller is utter perfection. Seriously. His actions and the way he handled all his situations was very commendable. Just remember that they are teens, and not everything is perfect.
And then there is Gramps. I love an old character that comes in funny or with some major sage advice. He was really a favorite of mine.
Then we have Jonah, Chris and Jenny. They are all major players in this story, but this is Morgan and Clara's journey and that's where the focus lies. Don't expect answers from them. ;)

Regretting You was a journey for two characters and while I wanted information from other characters, it wasn't their story. The way the characters interacted, the story flowed from past to present and from character to character was done so well. The plot moved at a pace that worked for the story being told. Of course I wanted more answers, but I was understanding of this mother/ daughter relationship that included their own personal relationships and how they navigated them. Colleen Hoover wrote a book that a mother could share with their high school daughter and hopefully bring them closer. While it's not my favorite CoHo book, it is still a book that I will love to share with others. It's beautiful and well told. The message about relationships and attraction really hit home.

""Attraction isn't something that only happens once, with one person. It's part of what drives humans. Our attraction to each other, to art, to food, to entertainment. Attraction is fun. So when you decide to commit to someone, you aren't saying, 'I promise I'll never be attracted to anyone else.' You're saying, 'I promise to commit to you, despite my potential future attraction to other people.'...Relationships are hard for that very reason.""

Colleen has a way with words and is gifting us with another book that details the flaws in humans and how we can react to them and process them. Be prepared to feel and learn all at once. Loving and hating the characters in this story will be a journey in itself. 4.5 stars",positive
