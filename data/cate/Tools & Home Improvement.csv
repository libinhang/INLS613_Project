0,Tools & Home Improvement,Brita Standard Water Filter,$13.29 - $51.29,5,"I live across the road from the Potomac River. Our water has always tasted very chlorinated in this location, but was tolerable to drink from the tap. I prefer room temp water and am not picky, but my husband wants chilled water and turns his nose up on the tap, so not having a refrigerator dispenser, we’ve had a Brita pitcher for some time. From a promo years back, I’ve just been accustomed to using the long term filters from the beginning, and they’ve seemed to have done their purpose, even if I think it’s more of a placebo effect for hubby.

Back in March suddenly one day our water was so badly chlorinated, it even smelled of bleach. We didn’t think much of it, but randomly listening to NPR a local DMV blurb said that areas where drinking water was sourced from the Potomac river were being maintained and with some sort of treatment, so water services would be disrupted in short intervals, and the taste of chlorine would be more noticeable but would be safe and temporary. Three months later it is still intolerable. My cats even have an aversion which is scary.

Anyway, our Brita pitcher was barely touching the chlorine. It was making a small difference, but it was still bad. We’ve definitely definitely been drinking less water, and I change up my cat fountain filter more often and refill from our filtered pitcher to help them. Realizing it was probably time to change the filter anyway (do those light indicators work for anyone???) I took into consideration that perhaps the long lasting filters may not work as good as the regular. I mean, why have the two options of there wasn’t an advantage to the short term one?

First off: Whoa. I had ZERO idea that a Brita could be filled so quickly. I thought that the obnoxious slow drip was just standard for being filtered. Wrong! I could actually finally fill the entire pitcher from empty without having to wait forever for the reservoir to empty, walking away and coming back in trips to the sink. Better yet? This quick filtering process actually does a substantially better job!

I nearly cried just now when I poured a glass of chilled water for the first time from this standard filter. No chlorine! I can stomach water again.

The convenience of refills and maintaining being healthy and hydrated will outweigh any costs of slightly more frequent replacement.",positive
1,Tools & Home Improvement,Brita Standard Water Filter,$13.29 - $51.29,4,"The water at my place used to taste great 5-7 years ago. Since then it has gotten and continues to worsen in both taste and smell. I bought a Brita pitcher and once the original filters were used up, I bought these. They do a great job taking out the stink and awful taste.

At the same time, the water has no flavor good or bad. It makes me wonder if there are any good minerals left in the water at all. Without minerals in the water, the water dilutes and flushes away the minerals in the body that we need to be healthy. While these minerals, vitamins and other nutrients need and can be replaced, that is an expensive and difficult process. The best sources are through diet, but that is already difficult and we can only eat so much in a sitting and or day.

There are water dispensers out there with filters filter systems out there that leave the good stuff behind leaving the water tasting fabulous, clean, refreshing, and satisfying. The satisfying because the good nutrients are still in the water.

These filters Do last a long time. I go over 6 months regularly. But, I am only 1 person and I don’t drink nearly enough water.

The filter can float up out of place when filling the water reservoir if not securely inserted into place.

The filter will sometimes fall or pop out of place when pouring a glass of water. When this happens with the lid is on, the lid pops off with a lot of force causing big splashing and dumping of water. This happens even when it’s positioned correctly and checked to make sure it’s and secure. Sometimes this happened even when I’ve poured some other glasses from the same batch of added water before the mishap. The water mess can cause time consuming and frustrating cleanup. It can cause permanent and/or costly damage to items such as furniture, carpeting, clothing, and paper products including personal and professional photos, documents and books, etc. The spills can also cause cooking/baking processes to be interrupted and/or damaging to whatever you are making.

The filters aren’t cheap, but given how much longer they last than the standard filter, they have less environmental impact. When I first bought the pitcher, there were boxes for sale that had 4 or more filters in it. I haven’t seen those available in a while and the price per unit has gone up quite a bit on buying 1 or 2 packs. I wish they could make a filter out of stainless steel with a natural fibers and filtering substances, like charcoal, but not necessarily charcoal.

Recap: The product is a mixed bag.

Pros:
Price: less than monthly filter replacement and other water filtering products.

Convenience: easier than monthly replacement. Less time spent buying.

Filter effectiveness: Can get out the things in water that make it taste and smell bad. (Results will vary depending on where you live, water pipe ages and materials the pipes are made of, (in your home, neighborhood, town, county), public water treatment plants, well water and water sources, polluting sources nearby, what is the water, etc.)

Cons:

Filtering: so effective the water ends up flushing out and/or diluting the minerals, vitamins, and other nutrients one needs for a healthy body.

Filter can float out of place when filling the reservoir.

Filter can and does sometimes fall or pop out of place which causes the pitcher lid to forcefully pop off, time consuming cleanup, damage to food products (and inadvertently cause damage the products used to cook and bake), at any time during and after the process, and can cause costly repairable damage and/or costly permanent damage to personal and professional, items from inexpensive to very expensive.

2,Tools & Home Improvement,Brita Standard Water Filter,$13.29 - $51.29,5,"I live in the rural outskirts of Tampa with a well pumping hard groundwater to our house without any softener or filtration system in place. There has always been a slight oily sheen on the surface of a glass of said water, and within 2-3wks, the shower heads all start plugging from iron and calcium deposits.

Britta changed all of that (at least taste/consumption-wise). I exclusively drink water passed through these filters because the difference is night and day!

5,Tools & Home Improvement,Brita Standard Water Filter,$13.29 - $51.29,5,"When Brita came out in the 90s, their filters cost about $8 each, filtered lead and harmful things, and lasted a good month or two.

Over the years, they appear to have snuck in cheap junk in the same white case, since bottled water is still $1 a gallon and they had to compete on price. The new filters last a few days or a week or two, don't filter lead, and often fail and grow mold. For a price that is suspiciously unchanged since the 90s. Yes, the price of a white filter from Brita has remained unchanged for almost 30 years! That should be a red flag that corners were cut.

Well, you get what you ( don't ) pay for. Filters today of good ( original ) quality should be $12-$15 each purely based on inflation. Which these are - just now in a blue plastic container.

I've seen people complain these will float up when you fill the pitcher. Also that they let water go around the lip of the filter meaning it gets no filtering. Or that you needed to add an O-ring. If so you don't have it seated fully. The old one would just drop in and seal fine. This one you need to wet the lip and then once you drop it in you will need to push quite hard on the top of it. It will slip in another 1/8th of an inch and you'll feel it bottom out. Now it won't bypass the filter or float up.

20,Tools & Home Improvement,Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener,$28.98 - $219.79,3,"You’re looking for a solution to open your garage door from a remote location. Package deliveries, the housekeeper, your tool-hoarding neighbor. This is one of several products out there that will do the trick.

If you’re a garage door tech, move along. You know this already. If your a DIY homeowner with grand plans, you must read on - This is what Chamberlain should tell you about their system but doesn’t.

While generally easy to install, without an Introduction or Basic Principles of Operation as a preamble, you will likely have the same issues I did. Read on for the lessons I learned and tips that will save your hair. I will explain each of the major elements of the system and provide suggestions to improve your probability of a successful installation.

The Door sensor: This sensor communicates with the smart hub using Bluetooth to indicate door operation and open/ closed condition. During installation it is paired to the smart hub which is best performed with the unit attached to a closed door between 3’ and 10’ from the smart hub. By design, Bluetooth distance is limited to 33’ but don’t count on consistent operation at this extreme end of the range. Consider this distance during installation and future operation.

Your 2.4ghz cordless phones, baby monitors, etc., can cause Bluetooth interference. Get them out. If your wireless router has a setting for Bluetooth coexistence, enable it.

Your Wireless (Wi-Fi) Network: The Chamberlain documentation says that 2 bars of 2.4ghz WiFi signal is enough for consistent operation. This can be checked by looking on your phone. I say, your mileage may vary. I installed a dedicated access point for the smart hub as I couldn’t get the system to work reliably. A wired connection is also supported.

Configure the smart hub with a static IP Address on your wireless network. This will help ensure the Chamberlain service can reach the smart hub quickly and easily when you activate the door. The additional time for the router or server to lookup a dynamic IP Address and establish a connection could create timing issues.

The Smart Hub: The smart hub includes a Bluetooth receiver for the door sensor, a 2.4 ghz radio to connect to your wireless home network for the system to communicate with Chamberlain’s servers on the internet, and a radio frequency (RF) transmitter to send HomeLink rolling codes to your garage door opener (on a channel in the 300-400mhz range depending on your garage door opener) - just like your remote clicker.

I discovered that the RF transmitter in the smart hub is fairly weak. While your car can transmit a signal a half block away, the smart hub can't. The instructions make a recommendation for placement of the smart hub but will make an explicit statement here - install it within the 4-6’ “recommendation”. Consider this when planning your installation. Apparently, orientation is important for maximum reach. If it doesn’t work reliably, flip it 180 degrees on its mount. Finally, like other garage door remotes, if it loses power you might have to re-program the system with the garage door learn button. They don’t tell you this so I will.

Finally, the smart hub needs to be located where it can communicate with; 1) the door sensor (Bluetooth), 2) the garage door opener (RF) and, 3) your wireless (WiFi) network to work consistently! Each has its own distance limitations so placement of the hub is critical.

Your garage door opener: You obviously have one to which you are adding this system. Do your homework and make sure it’s compatible before you buy. If you’re not positive, call or email them with your make and model numbers in hand. Mine is a Craftsman (Chamberlain) made in 1999 with the door sensors so I was good to go. NOTE: Garage door openers have a limit to the number of remotes they can support. My Craftsman supports 4 remotes. With two HomeLink-connected cars, the remote door opener, and the smart hub I am now at the max allowed by my opener. As a result, I had to decommission my ""clickers"". Do your homework and factor this into your plans.

The Phone App: A basic, functional, app with a few frills. It works well enough though some settings are best changed on the web site (that I didn’t know about). When installing the smart hub your phone will need to be on your 2.4ghz wireless network to complete the setup. After that, it doesn’t matter what your phone is connected to - your home network or a cell connection. The system can be setup entirely from your phone. I set up an open alert, a close alert and a 10pm door not closed reminder. The alerts can be sent to you via Text or email.

The Chamberlain service: Does not support Alexa or IFTTT (without a fee) and that’s fine for me. I always have my phone handy and I don’t need the security concerns that come with IFTTT. Also, multi-user accounts are not (yet) supported. I just program the wife’s phone with the same username/ password and off we go.

The system is fairly rudimentary and in my opinion could use some added intelligence. If the system components exchanged more status information it could probably avoid situations where the “door [is] not responding” or better error status information could be presented to the user. Sometimes I think it’s just that Chamberlain's servers are slow.

LED & Florescent lights: I hear you asking “why is this important?”. Both can emit radio and electromagnetic interference that can mask the signal between the smart hub and your opener. If you experience unreliable operation - out they go. The last thing I did was remove an LED lamp from a motion sensor fixture nearby and replaced it with a standard incandescent. Since the light is only on for a few minutes I’m not worried about the power usage if it means the garage door will close when commanded.

I give Chamberlain credit for trying to make the install easy. Considering the different operating environments and variables, it’s a challenge to cover all the bases. Unfortunately, a quick start guide simply isn’t enough in this case and the online instructions are no better. They have made some assumptions about what you need to know (or don't need to know). The above precautions should be spelled out to avoid customer frustration and reduce the number of calls to their help desk (and returned product).

The good news for me is that after 2 months of trial and error and multiple calls and emails to their help desk, I think we may finally have all the issues cleared up. My fingers are crossed.

Now you know everything Chamberlain should tell you but doesn't. Best of luck!",fair
21,Tools & Home Improvement,Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener,$28.98 - $219.79,5,"So many mixed reviews. Are people not following directions? Likely. Do people have a weak signal in their garage? Good possibility. Should some people not be allowed around technology? Definitely! I was hesitant after the mixed reviews. But there's something to be said for over ten thousand positive reviews and number one bestseller. I also like the idea of a wired button and magnetic contact switch that others have over the ""this is just another remote"" approach the MyQ uses. However, there's also something to be said for a simpler install, portability, fewer wires, and cleaner looking.
Just as others have said, follow the instructions. That's the best advice I can give you. If reading comprehension is not your strength, why are you reading reviews? Hire a handyman. The whole setup, and installation, was very quick and easy. If you can hang a picture, you can do this! I did not attempt to integrate with Amazon Alexa, Google, or ITTT. My new car does not have a Home Link mirror, so no remote. I didn't want an ugly clicker on my visor, and just something to leave behind in a rental car/truck. I've always got my phone, and if I didn't I couldn't close the garage until I ran in and grabbed it! Not to mention how many times did I already arm the alarm, but not yet check the garage door? A lot! how many times was the door left open all night? Even once is too many. How many times did I drive away and wonder, did I leave the door open? I see no mention of monthly fees for my install, and I did set up alarms in case the door was left open or did not close properly. I love the idea of turning my garage into my own Amazon Locker! How many times have I worried about packages on the porch? The whole install consists of two pieces of velcro and two drywall anchors with screws. The setup of the whole system was installing an App and pressing two buttons. If that frightens you, hire a handyman, or buy your neighbor a beer. As for that super loud, extremely annoying door close alarm that bothers the neighbors, perhaps they've toned it down. It beeps and a little LED light flashes. That's all there is to it. A power failure messes it up? I had it plugged into the wall for the setup, and disconnected it and moved everything for the final install. Nothing was lost. An extended power outage may be a different story, but how often does that happen? The device loses connectivity? Not that I have seen so far. Perhaps it's time to invest in a better router or access point? Chamberlain's support was/was not helpful? Chamberlain's support was not necessary. The device takes too long to respond. If nearly instantly is too long. My wife likes a clean garage. That means almost nothing is stored in the garage. Certainly nothing of value. But that also means this device received approval for it's clean, simplistic, nice looking install. Her words were, ""Very nice."" I'm happy. The wife is happy. What more could you want? I hope I've addressed all your concerns. Reading comprehension, hire a handyman or buy your neighbor a beer. That's really all there is to it.

I was looking for something I read here regarding 16 bit AES. I didn't find it, but just to clarify, there is no such thing. 16 BYTE, however, is the key size for 128 bit AES encryption. I also read where a couple of people stated this damaged their opener. Hogwash! There is NO physical connection between the MyQ and the opener. The MyQ is nothing more than another ""clicker"" like what you have in your car now. The MyQ basically has three radios built-in. One communicates with your Wi-Fi router over 2.4 GHz, the second communicates with the door sensor, presumably over 900 MHz, and the third is the ""clicker"" radio. Since this works with most openers, it is universal and therefore uses multiple frequencies depending on which make/model opener you have. Saying it damaged your opener is like saying I turned on my car stereo and my dishwasher shut off. Others say they do this for a living and... take that with a grain of salt. I provide IT support for a living and I know some people that don't have a clue what they're doing. Who among you works in an office, knows their job, does it well, and knows someone that struggles with even the basics of the job? We ALL do! Giving the benefit of the doubt, perhaps they received a defective unit. It happens. But more likely it's a problem with the customer's router. Most garage door installers are not computer techs, just as most computer techs don't know garage doors. If there were a problem with the tension spring on my door, or if it somehow began to move at an angle and got stuck, I wouldn't have a clue how to fix it. I'd have to call a door company. Installing this device is on the technology side, not the physical door side of the business. If your door guy is stumped, thank him for his time and call an IT guy. There are many devices around the home that operate at/near/ or have harmonics in the 2.4 GHz band. I found cases where a poor connection at an outdoor lightbulb, and another where a failing Infrared night-vision security camera cause sufficient noise in the band to make communication impossible. Some LED and many fluorescent lights will cause similar interference. Many wireless routers are factory set on channel 6 for Wi-Fi. You may be surrounded by signals from all 4 neighbors operating on the same channel as your router. I have a laptop with specialized software that identifies those signals and gives me a real-time graph of their strength. A good IT guy can identify this and change the frequency of your router to a much clearer channel. This can be especially difficult in an apartment complex, but you are connecting a garage door opener, so it's much more likely you're not in an area as densely populated. To sum it up, those experiencing trouble likely have other IT problems on their end. This is not a fault of the MyQ, and not something a garage door company can likely solve. The MyQ is a very simple device that operates completely wireless, with the exception of one power cord. For 99% of the people reading this, that's a good thing.

UPDATE: I have been using this daily for 6 weeks now. It has never dropped off the network. I did falsely alert once that the door was open when it wasn't, and twice it said it couldn't determine the status of the door. In each case, opening or closing the door reset it. The two times it couldn't determine the status were when I opened the app to open or close the door as I was about to drive through it, so no big deal. The false open alert was a little concerning, but I have a driveway camera on one side, and the door to the house on the other has an alarm. Neither showed any alerts of activity, so I knew all was well. Although this has me thinking a camera inside the garage might not be a bad idea. Is the door really open or closed? Did I leave a light on? I can simply view the camera on my phone or computer and be sure. If something WERE going on, I'd have it all on video. What's $30 for that extra peace of mind?

I should also note that I do not work for Chamberlain, nor any of their child companies. I paid full price for my device. My review is based on my personal experience, expertise, and opinion. I do not receive compensation for any of my reviews, but I'm not opposed to that! How can I get in on this? Free products in exchange for an honest review? It seems too good to be true.",positive
22,Tools & Home Improvement,Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener,$28.98 - $219.79,5,"On demand ... Garage door goes up, garage door goes down, Garage door goes up, garage door goes down... perfect for our needs.

I don't know how many times we pull out of the driveway and wonder.... Hey did the garage door actually close? So we end up turning around to take a look... Most of the time we did actually close the garage door, but there's that one or two times where we didn't.

So first we added a Ring camera (since we have ring) so we can peek inside of the garage when we are out of the house to see if the door is open or not. That was nice, but if we left it open it meant we had to turn around and go back to close it, or ask a friend to swing by and close it for us.

Finally after one such adventure where we were 2 hours away from home, we saw our garage door was left open. We tracked down our Dog walker who was able to swing by and close the door for us.

I had figured there had to be a better way especially in today's connected world. I looked at a few other solutions, some of which would have required me to wire directly to the garage door opener and this one which acted as a garage remote.

Since I have a Red Button (up to 20 remotes) garage opener I thought what the heck. Chamberlain is a well known brand so I'll give this a try.

15 minutes after opening the box, I was all setup, the door working perfectly.

Tested it a few times to show my friends from their house how it worked, showing the garage through the ring app while we opened and closed the door.

I really don't plan on integrating it with ring or amazon. I really wanted to just have it so that if we drove off leaving the door open, we can check, and close it without bothering our friends.",positive
23,Tools & Home Improvement,Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener,$28.98 - $219.79,3,"I got this device when it was still around $40. I would say especially now the price has got down, it is certainly a worthwhile investment to convert a dumb garage door opener into a smart one that you can control via your smartphone or allow Amazon Key access through the Key app.

Here are my general thoughts on this device:

The good:
1. Great battery life - Since it uses a larger-sized coin battery, a single battery usually gets about 10 months of operation in my case during normal operation.

2. The device was quite easy to set up with my old LiftMaster Professional garage door opener that did not support any smart connectivity.

3. Open/close push notifications are generally instantaneous and have been consistently reliable.

4. Status readings are accurate in real-time and the apps give a good history as far as when your garage door is opened/closed.

5. Guest user sharing that allows you to share access outside of your main account. However, sharing is location-based, and access cannot be delegated down to specific sensors.

6. Orientation sensors mounted on the garage door allow you to sense door activity without physically modifying the garage door (just a sticky tape mount on the garage door itself).

7. Amazon can actually deliver packages in the garage without leaving them at the doorstep.

The not so good:
1. There is approximately a five-second delay between when a close command is issued through the app and when your garage door actually begins to close. During that delay, the main unit emits constant, loud warning beeps warning others to clear the area. I find this feature annoying since it adds a delay to when you have to wait for your garage door to close and the warning beeps may startle others (like your neighbors) at night thinking that it may be some kind of break-in. There are no official ways to disable this feature, although you can open the unit and desolder the speaker so the annoying beeping can be stopped. Alternatively, using the physical button can also avoid this issue (but this only works if you have a physical remote to use as well).

2. The device only supports 2.4Ghz wireless connections and would not connect if WPA3 is enabled on your device, even in mixed WPA3+WPA2 PSK mode. This means that if you have purchased a newer router that supports WPA3, enabling it will prevent the main unit from connecting to it altogether. In those cases, you will either have to fall back to WPA2-PSK only mode or create an alternate network for IoT devices that support only WPA2-PSK on the 2.4Ghz spectrum.

3. Connections are not the most stable and sometimes you will suddenly receive notifications that your device has gone offline, even if all of your other devices are fine and are connected to the Internet. Generally, the device will fix itself within 15 minutes when this happens, but during that time you would not be able to open/close your garage door via the app.

4. Amazon Key activity is not always recorded - It seems like Amazon Key uses a different API to send door open/close activities to the garage door opener and their activities are not always 100% recorded in the garage door MyQ history. Although I have not had any thefts relating to this so far, having this happen without a record is somewhat concerning to me. You can tell this is happening because the driver can close your garage door opener without the same annoying beeps that you would otherwise get if you closed it with your app.

5. Google Assistant integration is pretty useless - They used to require a subscription for you to even use this, but so far this feature has been pretty useless. This is especially because you can only use this integration to close the garage door or check its status. If you are driving and trying to open the garage door via the assistant, you will simply get a message saying ""For security purposes, I cannot open the garage door yet."" What is the purpose of using the assistant if this cannot be done hands-free? Additionally, if you have multiple sensors, the MyQ app will often get confused and keep asking you which one you wish to operate. It is just much easier to try to tinker with the app and try to open the garage door that way. Although they have temporarily waived payment for this, I am not sure why someone would pay for this half-baked feature.

6. If you have MyQ and the Amazon Key app installed, they both start generating notifications at the same time. Although this is tweakable, this is still somewhat annoying.

7. If you ever had to change your Wi-Fi password, you will have to reset the whole system and start the repairing process all over again. I don't know why they can't just allow you to do this in the app before the password change rather than forcing you through the whole process again.

8. Although Amazon Key works most of the time, around 20% of the time the driver will elect to still put packages on your doorstep because it takes too long to open and close your garage door, and waiting for your garage door to open and close will cut into their delivery efficiency and rates. I actually have had multiple Amazon drivers shouting obscenities at the camera on different occasions because the garage door is taking too long to respond or they are carrying a large burden for the day. There was a Key delivery for an electronic that was both expensive and sensitive, but in that delivery, the driver ended up putting the package on the side door where my gutters were and the package got all soaked on a rainy day.

9. The coin battery, being larger than the standard CR2032 (it uses a CR2450), is more difficult to find in stores and generally more expensive. Although you can still find them online in bulk, it might be more difficult to find something quick when the device is running low in battery.

10. It tends to alert about the battery when the battery voltage is still a bit high. I measured the battery voltage of the stock battery which I replaced in which it said low battery, and the battery was still reporting 3.09V. Perhaps there is a high current draw that was causing it to go below a certain threshold, which seemed somewhat unlikely, I think perhaps they are doing this to try to get you to purchase these batteries more often (perhaps directly from Chamberlain themselves).",fair
24,Tools & Home Improvement,Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener,$28.98 - $219.79,5,"This was intended to be an upgrade for my garage door opener to make it wifi so I could use my phone instead of the stock remote to open and close and got more than I expected. I now don't need to purchase the expensive and bulky replacement remotes, I use my phone. I can add users and it even allows for Alexa integration which I have not personally used yet. It keeps a history of when the garage door was last open and by who, it tells you if the door is open or closed and it is fairly easy to add it to your existing setup. No wiring or replacement of your existing remotes required. But the best part is that all my Amazon deliveries are delivered inside my garage. That's right, no more stolen Amazon packages stolen from my front door and the best part is that I didn't have to provide an opener or code to the Amazon drivers. Amazon provides their driver a one time access through their propietary app to open the door based on geosync and other info that only Amazon drivers are given. Once package is delivered, the access rights expire. The only bad thing about this product is that only Amazon drivers have this access. Nope, UPS and FedEx does not have this feature so they still deliver on the porch. That's fine, as an Amazon prime member, I order quite a bit and get this service as one of my delivery option.

25,Tools & Home Improvement,Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener,$28.98 - $219.79,5,"I bought one of these last year sometime since it was $20 but I didn't actually install it until I got a house recently. It actually probably could be installed in a rental but you might have to get new velcro tape to mount in a new location if you move and you'd probably want to find a way to temporarily install the base station.

So far it seems to be working great for me. I have had a couple times where I got a few blocks to a few miles away when I realized I wasn't 100% sure I closed the garage door so I swing back home to check. I finally pulled out this device that I purchased last year and installed it. The installation was effortless for me since I have good Wifi coverage in my garage thanks to my mesh network with the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands separated. It gives me an alert each time the garage door is opened whether I did it with the car remote, garage button, or MyQ app. No complaints at all so far but I'll update this review if I find any issues.",positive
26,Tools & Home Improvement,Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener,$28.98 - $219.79,4,"I bought this because it went on sale for $20. For that price, I was willing to take a risk. I have a Genie garage door lift. It took several iterations of running the setup before it was finally detected. I was getting a little worried, but it finally did it.

Installing the sensor on the garage door was simply a matter of cleaning the garage door surface in a small area, then peel & stick the sensor. Installing the actual bub was a little more involved, but the same as installing a new smoke detector (albeit, it must go close to an electrical outlet).

It functions well. I use the app to open and close the door when the Homelink built-in to my truck is being finicky. The closing is not immediate-it flashes the light on the hub and beeps for about 8 seconds before it starts closing. This gives someone inside fair warning to get out of the way.

My only complaint- it does NOT work with the Google Home app. Instead, you have to use the Google Assistant app. That doesn't mean you can't use your Google Home speakers. But you have to jump through an extra hoop: ""OK, Google, talk to the myQ app."" Then you have to ask about the garage door (like ""Is my garage door open?""). That isn't a big deal, it's just annoying. What's more annoying is getting the Assistant linked to the MyQ app. The instructions online do NOT match the current version of the Google Assistant apo that's built into a Pixel phone! So here's how I did that:

Open the Google Assistant app.
""Talk to the MyQ app.""
Google will tell you it must first be linked then ask you if you want to link it.
""Yes""
Then it will display a page to login to the Mychamberlain website with an email then a password. And this is where the problem is. I set up my account in the MyQ app using my Google credentials - but it won't let me log in here through Google. So I had to tap ""forgot password"" and a new password was emailed to me. I copied and pasted that password and everything was fine and it linked.

Overall, the product has been good. The workflow is a bit clunky to set up and the instructions aren't exactly clear/updated. The app has some minor annoyances (like you can't go back after selecting Device Management then selecting the hub - you have to exit the app and restart it to get back), but overall it works. And for $20, it's a no brainer.

Note- I did NOT set up Amazon Key to allow Amazon drivers access to my garage door opener. I'm not going to do that - have too many tools and valuables to risk that! But MyQ keeps pestering me (through notifications) about that, reminding me to set it up.",positive
27,Tools & Home Improvement,Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener,$28.98 - $219.79,5,"I saw this on sale for $20 so I jumped on it. It comes with 1 sensor. I needed an additional sensor as we have a two door garage. I bought a second kit as it was cheaper than buying another sensor separately.

When I first tried to set it up, I had issues with the app. I kept getting an error at one of the steps involving the sensor. I simply exited out and started a fresh installation and it worked. Installing the hardware was very simple and easy. Setting up everything via the app went smooth after the initial issue.

The app works well and it is very easy to use for those who have family members who need something that is very simple. It is smooth and bug free for the most part.

One of the reasons I wanted to install this is for safety reasons. If someone managed to get into one of our cars, they could open the garage from the car's built-in garage opener. I was able to wipe all the codes from the cars so we can only open the garage via the app or the pinpad.

I do wish I could open/close the garage via the Ring app. While the device shows up in the Ring app, it opens the myQ app if I want to open/close the garage.

I haven't tried anything else in relation to Alexa yet. I really have no reason to as I never have a need to use Alexa to manage the garage. I do, however, want to look into geofencing to get the garage to open or close automatically if I'm coming home or leaving the house.

All in all, I'd highly suggest giving this a try to gain control of your garage even when away from your home and to erase the codes from your vehicle for safety concerns.",positive

Update: Here's my tip. I keep the camera on the garage door unit using the magnet. I may change this in the future, but it's fine so far. I put the motion detection on the lowest sensitivity so not to trigger whenever we go into the garage while the garage door is down. I set notifications and alerts for the camera similar to the garage door. Now I get one notification for the garage door opened and closed along with motion detection.

29,Tools & Home Improvement,Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener,$28.98 - $219.79,5,"This hub works with Genie intellicode 1 and 2. I have a newer wall mounted Genie and it did work.

It can be a little confusing because due to the fact that even the manual puts in doubt the compatibility with Genie I didn't want to waste my time mounting the sensor.

It came out that during the automatic programing the hub makes several tries untill the door is opened. The thing is, that the way they used to figure out if the operation was successful is by checking the door sensor. If the door sensor says the door is opened then the pairing worked. My sensor was still on the table, so even when the hub indeed opened the door the pairing failed. Until I realized and installed the sensor and tryed again.

1) So, you know, it does work with Genie (at least ""newer"" 97 and up or so models).

2) Install your sensor BEFORE pairing to your motor.

40,Tools & Home Improvement,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,5,"i LOVE this product so much, if i need to get another wifi camera, it will likely be another Blink.

I have not been compensated in any way, for this review.

Does everything ""as advertised"".

First - the bad news:

It should be mentioned there are two parts: the ""wall-mount bracket"" and the doorbell camera which attaches to the wall-mount.

This ""mounting bracket"" is horribly designed for its intended purpose (i.e. holding the doorbell camera against the door). Once the bracket is securely mounted to your door (or wall), it's *extremely* difficult to attach the camera to it. Even when following instructions - it required a great deal of strength to snap it in place.

I successfully did it two or three times, but at some point, i accidentally broke the little plastic clips that secure the camera in place.

Ultimately, problem solved by running a length of invisible scotch tape around the mounting bracket's edge, laying it on a flat surface (sticky side facing up), then carefully placing the camera down ""onto"" the bracket, and finally folding the tape UP and against the edge of the camera.

Once these two parts are together, then i take the assembly and ""stick"" to the door using adhesive strips (made by a well known stationery & adhesives supply co (think ""one more than '2L'.""))

I am ""NOT"" mechanically inclined. If you put a wrench in my hand - i won't know which end to use to screw in the nail! So take my word for it - using adhesive strips & scotch tape - if I could get this thing to stay on the wall securely - then you can too! As Mr Spock once said, ""Primitive but effective.""

In a couple pictures, if you look closely, you can see the tabs sticking out from beneath.

Also pictured (& you don't need to look all that closely) is extreme closeup (camera flash ON) so the tape is easily seen. However casual observation as you're standing at the door (even if you ring the bell), the tape is easily overlooked against the black plastic casing.

So while it's not ideal (indeed poorly designed), this bracket issue isn't a deal-breaker - especially for such an affordable price.

Now the good news!

OMG! Where to begin! BATTERY USE is nearly ""non-existent""! Put it this way: I've had my unit working for over three months, running on the same batteries it came with.

I live in an indoor building, and with neighbours, deliveries, etc - fairly high traffic / motion sensor triggered video 25 times in the past 24 hrs, and 33 times the previous 24 hrs. So that's just a little more than a 10-second video clip every hour.

For the past month - it's been on HIGH RESOLUTION (which uses more battery power), and longer clips both for ""motion"" as well as ""doorbell"" (this also uses more battery power).

So again - THREE MONTHS on the same batteries! Amazing! I should mention the batteries are Lithium (after tax & shipping, about $ 4 a piece). But i don't care. It's a great system! I love it.

This incredible battery-life / add to that it's ""feather weight"" - i don't mind using (& periodically changing) the adhesive strips - what? - ""every 3 or 4 Months""??

Blink Doorbell Camera works & plays well with Alexa. Because my office & Alexa are just inside our front door (i'm sort of the gatekeeper) - i don't want people hearing they've been detected - so rather than Alexa announcing ""Someone's at the door"" - instead, i have my office lights flash red & white. I also have it make a quiet ""ticking"" sound. On the other hand - my wife's office is far away from our front door, so in her case, Alexa simply says ""Someone's at the front door"".

Of course - the ""Blink"" app stamps the exact time each video clip was recorded (see image).

- - - - - -

Video Storage: They have an affordable cloud service ($3 per month at the time of this review), but i got the sync module so i don't need to pay for the extra cloud storage.

If my math is right - the extra cost for the Sync Module is about $ 36 - the same price you pay for a year of storage.

I strongly recommend the sync module over the pay service. Sync module works very well.

IMPORTANT: BLINK DOORBELL ONLY WORKS WITH 2.4G WIFI (i.e. it will not work on 5G).

I found this out the hard way, when i spent over a week, trying to figure out why i could no longer record video.

SIDE-NOTE: During this ""non-record week"", the unit DID still chime - both when motion was detected, as well as when the doorbell was pressed. Just no ""10-second recorded video"" of the chime.

Because of this issue - i also discovered ""Blink"" has a good, responsive tech support. Just be aware you must wait at least 48 hrs for them to respond. But they DO respond, and they're very helpful. :-)

Back story: one day, I suddenly couldn't record video, and sent them a service request. But before they got back to me - my camera was working again, and i couldn't figure out why (i thought it ""MIGHT"" be the 5G, but i wasn't sure).

So by the time they got back to me - i sent them an email saying Doorbell Camera was working again, i'm happy and issue Closed. Then (still not sure how/why it fixed itself) - i described my 2.4 / 5 G switch, and asked if that could have caused the problem? They replied ""YES"" and explained that 5G didn't work.

Again - this is ""AFTER"" i said it was working again (so at this point, they really didn't ""NEED"" to reply). And they REPLIED anyway! Personable and informative.

Not a ""BIG DEAL"", but if i had it to do over - i should have paid closer attention to COLOR! My door is mostly light & pastel colors (see picture). But my doorbell is BLACK, so aesthetically - it stands out a little more than it should. It's already sort of bulky from the get-go, so i wish i'd gotten the white one.

So again - overall this is an excellent system (& very AFFORDABLE too).

Get it! You'll be glad you did.",positive
41,Tools & Home Improvement,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,4,"I am a long-time user of Blink, meaning I am in the ""grandfathered"" set of customers with free, limited cloud storage for video. Overall, I think if you are already a Blink customer, this is a good addition to your system.

Install: I needed one of those ""wedges"" that turns the camera to face out and using that, the install was pretty simple. I agree with the people that noted that the back plate it comes with (which you still use when installing the wedge) is a little cheap and janky. But the wedge is more sturdy and the resulting install is probably a little bit more solid and better than if I had just mounted the flat plate to the wall.
You do need a good sized piece of flat wood to screw everything into. This is not going to mount well to raw siding, curved trim pieces around doors etc. You'd have to attach a small board to the surface of anything like that and then mount it to that board.

Power vs. batteries: I have one of those wired doorbells that is old-school, with the metal strikers that hit little chimes, not a digital doorbell. This apparently matters because you need more power and a slightly larger transformer to drive one of those doorbells. In turn, that means the transformer has enough power to power the blink doorbell. If you have a digital doorbell you may (or may not) need to rely on the battery for the cameras. It all depends on how big the transformer for your existing, wired doorbell is. During the setup it asks you what kind of doorbell you have, and has a fairly sophisticated set of settings to make sure that when it sends a signal to the physical doorbell it is sending the correct amount of power to strike the chimes correctly.

Set-up: Very easy and painless, almost exactly the same as setting up a regular blink camera. Put in the batteries, scan the QR code, it finds the camera, links it to your existing system/sync module and you are ready to go.

Motion Sensor: If you are already pretty familiar with Blink cameras, you know they can come with one of two kinds of sensors to detect motion. Camera based sensors that just detect changes in the picture and more traditional sensors that only detect actual, physical movement. The cheaper Blink mini only has a camera based sensor, while the more expensive units only detect actual physical movement with a dedicated motion sensor. Both kinds of sensors can be triggered falsely by something like blowing leaves, but the camera-based sensors cannot distinguish changes in shadows and light from actual movement and so they have much higher rates of false detection. Unfortunately, the blink doorbell appears to only have the cheaper detector that can be fooled by changes in light. It does, however, have a more sophisticated, narrower grid of zones you can exclude from movement than the older Blink mini. How much this matters to you is going to depend on where you plan to stick the camera - if you point your doorbell camera directly at a busy road and don't lock out the parts of the image that covers the road, you will get constant alerts from every car that goes by, or every person walking on the sidewalk, etc. So think carefully about where the camera will sit and whether you want one of those wedges to tilt the direction of the thing to keep the camera aimed only at places where you actually want it to detect motion.

Video quality: Very good, with a wide angle, almost fish-eye lens, so you get very good broad coverage of the area you are pointing the camera at. There is also a microphone that records sound while you are recording video and it seems to work ok as well. In theory you can use the thing to have a two-way conversation with whoever is at the door, but I haven't tried that yet. I am, overall, very happy with the camera quality for the price here.

Sound Chime/notifications: When you push the doorbell, a chime inside the module itself goes off. It is reasonably loud and lets the person ringing the doorbell know they definitely rang it. The light on the button also lights up briefly to confirm the chime was pressed. Would you, sitting inside the house, hear the chime the doorbell makes outside? Probably, if you are in a small, quiet house. Would you hear it down in the basement of a large house with the TV or music on? Absolutely not. So if you are not hooking this up to an existing doorbell with a properly loud internal chime, then you will want to have it hooked up to your Alexa. I don't use Alexa so didn't test that feature. You do get a notification on your phone, when somebody rings the bell, but I think most people will want either a hard wired connection or an Alexa connected to this thing to make sure they always hear the doorbell.

What don't I like?

I wish it had the same motion detection sensors as the larger blink cameras. I would have paid more to get that. Because it uses the camera to sense motion there are places where it really won't give good results. So think very carefully about where you will place this, how often the wind will blow trees and create moving shadows within the motion detection zone, etc.

It is annoying that even when the device is hard-wired, the light around the doorbell button isn't constantly lit. Just as if it were only running on batteries, it only lights up when you press the button. Not a huge deal in my installation, but if you don't have a porch light on, your doorbell will not be obvious to visitors. It is particularly odd that they put a red LED into the thing which apparently has no purpose other than in the initial setup. The design would be much better if the lighted ring around the button was always lit and then it flashed or turned red when you pressed it. It appears all of the hardware necessary to do that is in the device, but it is not programmed that way. I get that when the device isn't hardwired you don't want the button lit, but when it is powered it really should be lit in the dark.

For $50, this thing is ok. If you get it on sale, then it is a good deal, at least if you are an existing Blink customer.

I am surprised that they killed off the little bit of free cloud storage for new customers. That can't cost very much to provide these days and it was the key differentiator between Blink and some of these other companies that provide more elaborate, high-priced options. Blink's claim to fame is that it works well enough and is cheap. But if you have to pay a bunch of money for cloud storage no matter what, I would probably look at the more expensive options vs. Blink. It stops being a compelling value once you start having to pay for video storage.",positive
42,Tools & Home Improvement,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,4,"We have a front door that drivers keep leaving packages at despite an easy to read ""Please deliver all packages to back door"" sign mounted at eye level in front of the steps to the door. We also have a non-functional front door with steps, railing, and door knob all removed that they've left packages under. Sometimes even on the door to our deck on the opposite side of the house from the driveway (with no sidewalk leading there). We got 2 of these doorbells to see where TF they go in the front of the house when packages are not delivered to the back door as directed, and to monitor the back door. The front door had a wired bell with a bad button so it barely worked. The rear door did not have one so we previously used a simple wireless doorbell. After missing a UPS package that required a signature, we found the chime batteries were dead and decided it was time. With the Blink cameras we could at least monitor battery life via the app, and get alerted to a delivery if we weren't close enough to hear the chime. Or if the package was just dropped without ringing the doorbell.

We love being able to see what's going on, or what activity there was near a door, and even get an alert when someone pulls into our driveway due to the range of coverage.

However, the documentation is confusing. With both wired to our existing chime the cameras report ""external power OK"" instead of ""Battery OK"", so I'm not sure how to monitor battery life. Documentation on that is lacking, and the notification settings don't match what I see in Android 12. Documentation states the doorbell always runs on battery though, so the change in monitoring is confusing at first glance until you dig through FAQs for the official answer:

The Blink Video Doorbell closes the power circuit of your existing chime system, it does not provide power of any kind. If the chime system loses power for any reason, the doorbell only plays the Blink Chime sound and your existing chime will not activate.

I don't recall if this was covered in the FAQs/documentation I read before buying, but I found out during the install that I didn't need to make any changes to the wired chime like with Wyze (requires you to bypass the chime making it no long function so the doorbell can be powered) and other models. Install was so much easier than I expected, aside from having to run a new wire to our back door just to tie that doorbell into the wired chime. Now we'll be able to add another doorbell to our side door to monitor the deck without any wiring, and the sync module saves us the monthly cloud fee.

Motion capture has been a bit weird. I have field of view blocked off from the house side of the front sidewalk to the top of the view to ignore the street and nearby tree branches. Yet we still get motion alerts from the occasional car passing by on the street. Seems more frequent at night, especially vehicles with reflective paint/stickers (police cars, school buses, etc). Front door view is kind of dark, despite a nearby street light, but I don't want to turn up the IR intensity if it'll generate more alerts from traffic. I also walked the dog across the entire front lawn (the whole area I have set to monitor) during the day and it did not trigger a motion alert.

In the end, it's great getting the alerts we do. It was more than we got before, and the doorbell chimes should be more reliable now in addition to getting the phone alerts when out of hearing range of the wired chime. All for a reasonable price, with no monthly fees building up.

Edit 8/27/2022: The ""false alarms"" for the front door camera due to headlights from passing traffic at night, setting sun, etc have been eliminated with an angled mounting bracket. With the doorbell angled down, those alerts have stopped. And its better anyway as it covers more of the steps down from the door.",positive
43,Tools & Home Improvement,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,5,"We purchased our first Blink Home Security Camera July of 2018. We were going out of the country and wanted to make sure our 18 year old son closed the garage door and locked the house. It did the job and we felt better knowing while on the other side of the world we could monitor our home.
The following Summer we were so happy with our indoor system, we decided to purchase 2 outdoor cameras with the 2 way audio, and were so happy with the video and audio quality, we bought another add on outdoor camera, the next month.
A year later we found the mini indoor cameras. We have one for a child's bedroom and one for the playroom. The video and audio quality is great.
A year after that we bought another 3 outdoor Cameras, again video and audio quality is great.
Just before Christmas 2021 Blink came out with the doorbell camera, and we purchased it. One, because it was blink and 1/2 the price of a ring doorbell camera. Two, because the doorbell that came with our new build home was so quiet, we couldn't ever hear the bell ring.
In total we now have...
3 Indoor battery powered
2 Indoor mini corded power
6 Outdoor battery powered
1 doorbell wired to exciting doorbell.

Blink offers two subscription plans.

1 Blink device
$3 per month or $30 annually

Unlimited Blink devices
$10 per month or $100 annually

You do not have to have a Blink Subscription if you do not choose to, but you won't be able to store videos.

With the subscription you are even able to share your videos by text, or email. To neighbors, Friends, Family, and even the police department.

Cons/irritations
When an outdoor camera faces the sun at any point of the day, the motion detection will go off, until you adjust the motion activity spots in the camera settings. This can take a few days to work out the kinks.
Indoor mini cameras the motion activity spots don't always work. Sometimes it will go off when there is motion in the grayed out zones, and sometimes not go off in the non-greyed out zones. This maybe human error on our part. We are looking for a longer cord for the mini's to mount on the wall or ceiling. The are options to rotate the camera view, so that you are able to mount the camera wherever you need.

Overall we are happy with our Blink system and hope the company continues to grow and come out with new products.

Compared to my parents very very expensive Arlo system, Blink is more reliable, and is more cost-effective. So much so, my parents have ditched the Arlo camera system and have purchased a new Blink system.

We highly recommend Blink to anyone who would like to have a home video camera system that works, and won't break the bank.
We love that you can start out small and work your way in to as much as you want/need.",positive
44,Tools & Home Improvement,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,5,"I have an Echo Show 5 and a Blink module 1, so I was worried whether this would work from all the reviews that said it didn't work with show and the details that said you need module 2. But, it works great and was super easy setup! I just opened the blink app on my android phone, tapped plus sign to add device, selected device, it had me scan the QR code that came with door bell, I put in the batteries, app scanned and found it quickly, let me rename it and choose all my settings. For my echo show, I already had the Blink skill enabled for my Blink security cameras, and I got a notification on my phone that alexa found new device without me doing anything. I mounted the doorbell easily on porch, I did not wire to existing doorbell. I rang the bell, and it rang on my phone and announced from my echo show. I said ""Alexa answer the doorbell"", show said ""ok"" and brought up the live feed quickly, there was a mic button I tapped to turn on mic, spoke and my voice came from doorbell! Great picture on echo, love that I can 2 way talk and see who is there. And with the module 1, it has free cloud storage. Very happy with purchase! Maybe those who couldn't work it with their Show didn't have a module, I don't know, but works great with module 1.",positive
45,Tools & Home Improvement,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,5," If you are like me you are a happy existing Blink Camera user who is thinking about adding the door bell to your existing setup. I had a blink camera setup aiming at my front door so at first I was not too sure that I really needed the door bell. However for the cost I am very glad I got one. There are a couple of things to know:

(1) If you are an existing Blink customer, you do not need a second sync module. All you need is the door bell and you can simple add it to your existing account (as easy as adding an additional camera).

(2) If you are planning on hardwiring the blink doorbell to your existing doorbells wires. . . . you still have to use 2 AA batteries to power the camera. This did not make sense to me as I figured my hardwires would power it, but sure enough after calling Blink support I realized I needed to put the AA batteries in the camera. The hard wire will allow your blink doorbell to ring the doorbell in your home but will not power the camera.

(3) You can turn on motion detection or just have the blink door bell turn on when the door bell is rung. This is a nice feature. If you want to catch anyone that comes to your door (whether they ring the bell or not, you can simple turn this feature on in the app). If you want to save battery life and are only interested in door bell ringers you can turn motion detection off.

(4) It has two way audio, meaning you will always hear the person at your door. . . . but you can also choose to speak to the person if you choose. For me the audio the person at the door hears comes across a little staticky, but that could be my phone or the fact that I am using the corner mount.

(5) It has more of a fish bowl view so it catches a wide view (meaning it can cover most of your front porch)

(6) There is no additional cost to having the Blink doorbell or camera system. Unlike other door bell systems out there, there is no additional cost to the Blink Doorbell. The app is free, cloud storage is free, downloading images or videos is free, etc.

If you are looking to set it up with just batteries and no wiring to an existing doorbell system, setup is a breeze (will take two minutes). If you are looking to hard wire it, it is still pretty easy. I am not a handy man and what I know about electricity will shock you (get my joke) but even I was able to hard wire it. Get the doorbell, you will be glad you did. Hope this review helped.",positive
46,Tools & Home Improvement,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,5,"I opted in for Blink as: (1) I do not want to subscribe to any cloud storage. This unit can store images on local storage units (any flash drive would do). (2) I do not need any best quality picture; just good enough to identify the subjects. It turned out that this unit sends high quality pictures even in ""Standard"" mode (not ""Highest quality"" mode) anyway.
My door faces a street with some traffic, but I was able to block out car movements by highlighting dark areas on the app. With a few trial and error, I was able to minimize false alarms. I also put the sensitivity level to 3. Even at that level, it detects any humans who approach the door.
Since Blink is owned by Amazon, it can easily be connected to other Amazon devices. Currently I am using Echo as a doorbell announcer (Alexa does that). You'd need something indoor (old fashioned bell or digital devices), as you may not be able to hear the ring sound outside the door, and you may not have your phone with you at all times.
Strongly recommended for budget conscious home owners who may not care for the best quality pictures and fancy features.",positive
47,Tools & Home Improvement,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,4,"I'm usually not one to write a bad review because I feel as if it's just me fumbling the bag but with the Blink, I have found many other peole with the same problems (THAT ARE FIXABLE) but with no answers anywhere online and the support just repeats what the websites FAQ already says. My biggest problem with this doorbell is how misleading it is. It does work as a doorbell. It does record when the button is clicked. It does record IF motion is detected. It does let me view on my phone but theres a catch which is nowhere (very hard to find) clarified before purchase. On battery only, you can only view the camera if it notifies you that something is happening. Otherwise you cannot just view it whenever you want, unless you buy a seperate sync module and usb stick with enough storage to support constant footage. Or you can hard wire your doorbell but it still won't let you live view unless you unsync the whole sustem through the app and resync it again. Instead of them telling you, you have to do that, it lets you just swap setup in settings without unpairing but THAT DOES NOT WORK. I tried researching and could not find answers at all and thought I was going to return the product. Once you get through the few problems there are with no support or proper informational help, the product is great. The camera quality is not much worse than rings which is fine considering the huge price difference. Motion detection is a little iffy but Id rather it detect 1 out of 5 cars driving by then not detect a person walking up and taking my packages. Sensitivity is customizable but in my use lowering it makes it not pick up people very well. The app is decent, sometimes doesnt work but overall good. Product and app are good but setup can be terrible.",positive
48,Tools & Home Improvement,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,5,"So, my husband and I really disagreed about getting a Blink doorbell. He was really against any video doorbell, but he relented and we agreed to get it. Well, it was extremely easy to install. It took me with my upper body strength of a kitten under two minutes to install. I synced it up and it was completely easy to get going.

Or so I thought. I ran into two issues: 1) we live on a very busy street, and the cars on the street triggered the motion sensor every five minutes; and 2) only the person pressing the doorbell could hear it ring.

After a few weeks, I had to admit that my husband was right. The Blink doorbell was horrible.

Then, I set about problem solving.

For the first problem, I had already tried adjusting the motion sensor’s sensitivity by one setting, but when I did that, the doorbell didn’t even detect motion when someone went up to it and waved to it. So, I googled it and one suggestion was to get a wedge mount. I installed it this week and it worked perfectly. I have no idea how—I can’t tell the difference between the pictures it took before and after the wedge mount—but it works. Cars no longer set off the motion detector, and it detects when people go into our yard/porch. Perfect!

With the second issue, I looked for chimes like the one the Ring camera has, but there isn’t one for Blink. Then, I looked to see whether I could set it to alert through our Echo and Echo dots. We live in an old house that has no light switches, so we have smart lighting and use Alexa to turn on the lights. I hadn’t checked before because I did not realize we wouldn’t be able to hear the door bell. Once I checked and found that you could enable the Alexa skill to notify you when your doorbell rings, it was great. When someone pressed the Doorbell, Alexa says “There is someone at the front door.”

With those two adjustments, my husband actually said, “You know, I actually like this doorbell.”

The great thing with using the Echo devices for doorbell press notifications, is that you can put your Echo devices in do not disturb mode, so say your two-year-old is napping, you can set the Echo in his room on do not disturb and the doorbell won’t wake him up. Brilliant!

If we didn’t already have several Echo devices in our house, it would not have been a good purchase for us, as we could not hardwire it into an existing door chime. This is really best as an accessory to Echo—it’s not a stand alone device.

Though, I’m not sure what the Echo Show really brings to the table. If you have a smart phone, you can see who is at the doorbell and communicate with them. Walking over to a specific Echo Show to do so, when you’re probably already carrying your phone, does not make sense to me.",positive
49,Tools & Home Improvement,Introducing Blink Video Doorbell - P,$39.99 - $179.98,3,"We bought 2 of these - because our house didn't have working doorbells ... and we couldn't hear people at the door. And that was a problem.

We got them activated, then it took a little while before we could get them installed. I think we missed our 2 week free trial entirely. But, it takes a while to get things done while unpacking.

The day we put them up, we lost internet for 3 days. They don't work without internet.

Finally, we had them up and running.

They are S L O W .... I watched the mailman ring the doorbell ... set down the packages ... and leave. As the truck was driving away, my phone chimed ... about 20 seconds.

My son has enjoyed them. He can talk with me from the garage door or front door. I can open the Blink app to watch the live video. My husband even gets the doorbell while he is driving around town.

Maybe we need to get the services that go with these ... I didn't think about extra monthly charges when I ordered them.... service is by Blink, a company of Amazon.

My ""Show"" doesn't seem to be able to connect to the devices .. one of the big reasons that we chose Blink doorbells is so we could see them from our Show devices.

Overall, not impressed.

I've never gotten the motion detection to work. Night vision has not been tested.

But since they are fully installed, I'm not removing them to send them back.

Update after nearly 3 months:

Great:

You can talk to people IF you open the app. But having the app open all the time is hard on your phone batteries.

Easy to install

We are still on the first batteries, and the front gets a lot of traffic.

It is easy to pause them if you plan to work near the camera range to avoid constant notifications. (ONCE you know where to find it on the app)

If your app is working. It can be fun to scare the kids working near the camera... ""I see you!"" Ahem. It can be great tool to talk to the person at the door. Especially if you don't want to open the door.

The range of vision is HUGE. The resolution is great. You can usually get good details.

The Ugly:
The delay is so long, that people sometimes walk away before you know that they arrived. They hear the bell. You hear it 10 to 20 seconds later IF you have sound up on your phone.

No matter how hard I've tried, it doesn't really interact with my Echo Show. That connection seems to do nothing. I expected it to act like an indoor doorbell, and then show me the camera view. I expect my dots to chime. But nothing happens.

Images only show on the app cloud storage. You can buy a device to store data at home. But I wish I could view the picture from the doorbell 2 minutes later when I get the notification!
Which leads to ... you HAVE to get that subscription if you want this to function as a camera.

NEED TO IMPROVE:
They need a dedicated box you can mount inside the house that has a loud CHIME when the doorbell is pushed. OR get this feature to work with your dedicated Alexia devices. Doorbell is pretty worthless if the only person who hears it is the person who pushed the doorbell. .... Yeah, it chimes OUTSIDE!

Need to be able to pull open the app and activate the camera to see outside on demand (like I do with the Blink mini cameras).",fair
50,Tools & Home Improvement,Filtrete AC Furnace Air Filter,$25.31 - $171.18,5,"Yeah, I bought the wrong ones because I've got bad mold sensitivities. However, I was just a little lazy about changing filters and my motor burned out. I'm one of those that take a good 20x20 Lasko fan and put one of these behind it. I filled the corners to make it a ducted fan and the sound level drops WAY down. But having the 1000 Merv 11, I've got loads of airflow, just crazy amounts. The fan itself wasn't made to be ducted so the reduction in fine filtration made the airflow difference and will actually prevent this burnout from happening again, though I've only had it once. I think that was one of the water resistant motors which are closed. The open case motor is much cooler since air flows around the rotor and now it's getting more air in general. So I'm not getting as good filtration, in mold and tiny stuff, but since these fans aren't really made for pulling hard, even with my difficult to make duct, the 1000 is probably better in the long run. It blows really well on 1, so I will save some electricity and make my fans last a lot longer. These good Lasko fans aren't cheap. I had one last 25 years but it didn't have a filter behind it. I used it for a couple years with a filter and it seized an old dried up bearing. So I should have known that pulling air through filters with these heats things up and that will shorten the life, but it all connected when I got out my new filters and ""Hey, It's sure blowing like crazy. No wonder. I got the 1000s."" Now I remember making this decision on purpose for these very reasons, but before the motor burned out. So if there are others like me out there, I'd recommend the Merv 11, or 1000 because our fans will last longer. Maybe I just waited too long to change it. Well, that's possible. Maybe if you're better at changing filters, there's no problem with the 1550, but another plus with the 1000s is that they're cooler in the summer, blowing clean air at you from across the isle and on #1 setting. #2 is great and if I were to put the new motor into the ducted frame, the sound would pipe down. I guess it's like everything. How much time and how good is your back to make or reuse a ducted fan? I'll say this, If you want to make a ducted fan, get the pink or blue foam boards at Home depot. I found a purple piece of packaging foam and that cuts like butter. It's great to work with and sound absorbing. Don't use styrene foam, (brittle, crusty stuff). It's hard to deal with in every way. I wish there's someplace to buy these online. That makes it so much easier that it's not such a dreaded task at all. Anyway, Merv 11 will allow better air flow and that might help make up somewhat for the difference in filtration but I know the 1000s are not going to ruin a Lasko in 7 years. They'll last forever (essentially) on these Merv 11s. In this hot weather, I'm enjoying that better airflow. I also recommend the Lasko fan combo. Esp on these 1000s. They really keep the air in the house clean. I had my carpets cleaned and he said, ""you're gonna have a lot of dust here on the AC inlet louvres. Well? (he tries again.) Huh. These are completely clean. Not a speck."" He walks off mumbling ""I don't know why it's so clean..."". It's the Lasko/3m combination. It cleans SO MUCH air. I can go 2 years on a house filter and even then I don't see dust, I just assume it's there. It has to be. My inlet grates are spotless. Anyway, it really works and for so little money. I don't even bother to tape it up. The vacuum of the fan pulls it into the fan. That's the first thing I noticed. It barely pulled. That's the difference between the Merv 13 and Merv 11. It is a matter of preference ultimately, so try one of each. Keep the one you don't like because it's a lot better than nothing. (Unless you've got loads of money, I guess. I'm more of a waste not want not. It's not exactly true, but the saying has a point.) Anyway, I almost forgot. I prefer these filtretes over Filterbuy and others. They're sturdier and I believe they filter better, the MERV ratings being equal, the 3M is better made and it filters better, though I'll use a Filterbuy on the house system, for some reason. There's a frame around the house filter. So sturdiness isn't as important. These 20x20s for the Lasko fan are moved around, bumped into. They take the punishment and never get damaged. 3M really knows how to box these up, by the way. They're glued everywhere and it's very hard to open. Be careful.",positive

60,Tools & Home Improvement,"All-new Ring Video Doorbell (2nd Gen) – 1080p HD video, improved motion detection, easy installation",$84.99 - $164.98,3,"I had the original Ring Doorbell for about a year and really enjoyed it. It was cheap but lower quality video resolution. It was fine for the time I had it. When the same thing with improved video was being released, I jumped on it. I received it today and got it installed. The video quality is night and day as shown in the photos and much better than the 1st generation. Good work ring. Unfortunately, the installation and mounting sucks compared to the 1st generation. Why they did this, I have no clue but here are the issues.

1. The mounting plate on the first generation has connections for the wiring. This made it very easy to remove the device and charge, especially in the winter months where we live and the batteries lose charge. 2nd generation has a mounting plate and the wiring on the back of the unit, which was a pain especially when the existing wire is not very long. This will be a nightmare having to remove this and recharge compared to the 1st generation. I had no issues with the 1st generation. This is a failure for Ring in my opinion. I am debating about keeping my 1st generation instead of this now.

2. The mounting of the device to the frame also sucks. The 1st literally had no gaps and was secure in my opinion. It had guides that made the doorbell align to the mount. The 2nd generation does not and there are gaps all the way around and loose. I mounted it no differently than before, in fact the holes for 1st and 2nd generation are identical which is a plus, but again I see this mounting as a failure for Ring.

I literally just installed this, and outside of the perfect video, I can’t attest to motion and nightvision yet. I am disappointed in the execution of mounting the device. I have no idea why this changed this from the 1st generation but this was a bad move in my opinion. I still have no idea why these require a battery they never stay charged when connected to wiring, but I assume this unit will have the same issue for me as well come winter. They really need to rethink the whole battery idea and have a hardwired version and battery version or fix the way these thing function when power is applied. At this point I may deal with it and hope Ring fixes these mounting and wiring flaws. If this mounted the same way as the 1st generation, I would not be writing a review because I had no issues with the device other than the battery and that wasn’t enough for me to write a review. Excellent otherwise but seriously why did you change the way these mount?

***Update 6/6/2020***

So I decided to keep it primarily because I had already offered to sell my 1st generation to a neighbor, but I did end up having to make some changes. Ultimately I bought some spade terminals and soldered them to my doorbell wire with heat shrink tubing (Ring provided in older versions, but not this one for some reason). While it was easy for me, it won’t be for others. Overall I am still upset over this mounting as it is extremely poor execution when the previous version was perfect. I guess this is Rings way to get the price down to $99 by cutting corners. The doorbell it self seems quality but mounting just plain sucks. I have no other words for it. You can see my updated photos of what I did. There are two photos that show the camera quality difference. The low quality image is from a generation 1 ring and the better quality HD is from the generation 2 ring. Night vision appears to be decent and motion the jury is still out because of the People only filter. I am still trying to tweak it. I am still leaving only 3 stars because of the mounting issues and there is still a gap between the mounting plate and the doorbell. Maybe Ring will fix and send everyone a new mount, but that is wishful thinking.",fair

I got it and had issues with it not picking up people standing directly in front of it. I'd test it and it wouldn't pick me up until I walked away and was turning a corner. Called tech support 4 times trying to get it figured out, and finally we got it going. (Support people were very nice.)

It's MOSTLY 100% now. I think one problem was that I had set up a package zone to tell me when packages arrive. Don't waste your time. It's worked one time. Once I turned it off, it did a much better job of detecting people.

It still misses the mail carrier here and there. The carrier has to walk directly towards the camera and then stand in front of it, about a foot away, to put mail in the box. Should be easy to detect.

Night vision is amazing. Connects to my wifi and my Alexa with ease.

After reviewing videos and doing some research and talking to her about the system, we installed the bells and tested out the app. It was everything we were expecting and more! We can also edit the range so we don’t pick up motion from the road. It’s a little trial and error but pretty easy to zone in.

Have it hardwired to a 18V AC plug in transformer with 500mA current output, and it is working well so far. Contrary to the reviewer who thought it was poorly designed for install, I prefer this install. The wires being connected directly to the doorbell body means that the wires are shielded from rain, unlike the first generation doorbell where the supply wires were connected to the doorbell mount and the doorbell made physical connection with sprung pins against solder pads on the mount, to acquire charge. This is just a much better connection and means charging will be faster.

When Amazon had its recent sale, they lowered the price of an updated (2020) version of the Gen 1, claiming it was much better.
I decided to roll the dice and spent the $79.99 and purchase this updated unit and see for myself it was any better.
I installed it today and OMG! what a difference...The picture is so much clearer and seems to have a wider-angle view...Best of all the motion detection is almost real time fast.
On my old unit it would detect the motion about 4-5 seconds after someone come to the door and usually all I would see on replay was their back as they were walking away.

102,Tools & Home Improvement,Tenmiro Led Lights for Bedroom 100ft (2 Rolls of 50ft),$17.99 - $35.99,5,"One thing I have to get out of the way first, I do not use the adhesive strip because I have wallpaper and painted surfaces in my fith wheel RV, so I am suspending this light strip with vinyl coated coffee cup hooks.
I don't know why I purchased the fifty foot length for a twenty-four foot trailer, but it allowed me to one and a half wrap around the central living/kitchen area with the tail going up into the bedroom.
No, they aren't quite as bright as the twelve volt RV lights I have. But that is exactly why I purchased this set. A softer even illumination that is much gentler on the eyes.
I know this is the 110 volt version but I do have a generator and power converter if needed.
The suggested Keepsmile app works great as long as you enable the permissions before launching the app. The app found my light and model number without having myself having to go to my Bluetooth settings and pair the light first.
All in all, this is a great light strip and I will recommend it to friends and family.",positive
103,Tools & Home Improvement,Tenmiro Led Lights for Bedroom 100ft (2 Rolls of 50ft),$17.99 - $35.99,5,"The adhesive was actually better than I thought it was going to be. For some reason, I was worried that I'd have to pin them up by myself. It actually has sticky adhesive on the back, and you peel the paper off of the back like a fruit roll-up, and stick it to the wall. I got the 130ft size, and it's enough to cover the perimeter of the ceiling, as well as around all of the doors in my living room. The app works surprisingly well to sync the lights up with music, however unfortunately you can't link it with Spotify due to copyright reasons, so you'd have to use music that's downloaded on your phone. If you're someone that downloads music from YouTube or from a computer, then that feature would work well for you. Overall, I'm really pleased with this purchase. I had a small party last night and everyone thought they were really cool. I'll probably end up purchasing more for my bedrooms!",positive

My room looks better than I imagined it would. Very neat and clean look with a lot of light! The 100 feet wrapped around both the edges of the floor and ceiling all the way around my room. I won’t need any other light fixtures because it provides plenty of light.

It has so many different options for the lights and has so many colors. I had to change the AC adapter because the one that it comes with is very short but that was a very very easy thing to fix and I ended up using one row for my whole room and I'm pleasantly surprised to see how bright the lights get.

Followed instructions from one of the videos posted here and installed them in no time. We did not measure correctly. We bought 150 ft but only needed 65 Ft. glad we opened the pack of 100 ft first. It can in two separate 50 ft spoils that attach to one outlet. So after the first 50 ft we came up a little short so to make it work we had to overlap a small section to meet up where the first 50 ft ran out. As long as you overlap it identically matching up the lights you can not tell. My teenager loves them! They have the perfect brightness, multiple options, and works to the sound of music.",positive
107,Tools & Home Improvement,Tenmiro Led Lights for Bedroom 100ft (2 Rolls of 50ft),$17.99 - $35.99,4,"I didn't know what to expect with these but they definitely amaze me.
100ft is no joke and it was big enough for me to outline my whole living room.
I didn't download the app I strictly use the remote and it works fairly well. Sometimes you need to push a button more than once but it's pretty responsive.
The lights can be incredibly bright or you can dim them at night which is great.

I didn't use the adhesion I just taped them up with scotch tape (in case I change my mind) and it's very easy to keep them up with just tape!

Definitely read the instructions included and you'll probably have no issues.

You can't dim them in every mode and the sensor in music mode is a little off but it's definitely a great little edition.

I'm so pleased and for the price I paid even if they don't last forever I've definitely got my money's worth so far.",positive

We always make sure to have fresh filters in place and feel it's worth the extra dollars to know we're buying a quality, highly tested filter from the manufacturer.

120,Tools & Home Improvement,"LEVENIS Kids Masks 50 Pack, Breathable 5-Ply Protection Masks Filter Efficiency≥95%",$13.99 - $50.46,4,I like the mask when I put in on initially. It is very thin and it does make me question the amount of protection I'm getting. Definitely not a mask you can use a few times because it breaks down quickly and gets very itchy on the nose. Doesn't seal the easiest around the nose so I wouldn't use it in a known covid infection situation. I do feel okay enough with it to trust more than a regular face mask. I feel like the mask would be better if the mask were a layer thicker. Doesnt fog my glasses much but I feel the airflow on the sides which is how I know the mask isn't sealed.,positive

This brand fulfills that. It is well made, the ear loops do not tear easily. The mask fits comfortably around the face even with a mustache and short trimmed beard. It also does not hurt around the ears when worn.

These masks are really black colored and not just painted black like other cheap brands, it does not have a chemical or paint smell which is also a huge concern with cheap masks.

Overall this brand is well worth the money spent. It is well made, comfortable and safe to wear with no chemical smell. I would recommend this product.",positive

130,Tools & Home Improvement,face mask Black-BY01,$17.99 - $32.99,5,"I'm long winded, so I'll give you the punchline first:

For the price, these masks:
1] are much better than I expected

2] have some amount of variation in strap length that doesn't matter for my shape/size of face but could matter for small faces

3] have all the ""right"" markings, although to me that's no guarantee of a mask not being counterfeit

4] are lightweight and comfortable for my face

5] don't seal wonderfully around the bridge of my nose when exhaling; fogs up glasses/sunglasses. Seems to seal fine when inhaling. In other words, low risk of outside air sneaking in unfiltered, highly likely unfiltered exhaled air from you would get out. Don't wear these around your high risk grandma if you are trying to protect her from you.

6] definitely have 5 distinct layers (see picture).

Long-winded verson:
As with any commercial product nowadays, it's hard to know what to expect after reading reviews. The most vocal and emotional reviewers are generally those that get a crappy product and are understandably upset. When I'm shopping for the best value version of any cheap, mass produced item, I fully expect there to be some percentage of products that made it out the door with defects.
That said, the box of Funight masks that I just received are much better than I expected. I haven't opened every single mask up, so there may be some in this box that have some of the issues mentioned in other reviews (ear straps that easily detach for instance), but so far so good. At this price, I'll be happy if 3/4 of these don't have defects.
I don't claim to be a filtration expert, but I know enough about filtration media to know that the type of material matters much more than the amount. In this case, for anyone basing their choice on these masks having 5 layers as advertised, they do; I attached a picture of a section cut out showing all 5 layers seperated. I wouldn't have been too surprised if they didn't at this price, but hey, I'll take it!
Also, all of the ""correct"" markings (""KN95"" and ""GB 2626-2019"") are thermally compressed into the mask, not that I personally think that means anything. I can't imagine there is some reason that counterfeiters can't put the right markings on their masks; relying on that as an indicator of masks being legitimate makes about as much sense as looking for markings that say ""counterfeit"" on counterfeit masks.
These Funight masks are really comfortable for me, and do a great job of sealing around my face, except up over my nose, where they do allow some air to flow out and fog up any glasses/sunglasses I might be wearing. They're no worse than the accordian/surgeon style masks I've worn previously though.
They are comfortable over my nose, but all masks I've tried that don't have an extra strip of rubber/foam to help seal don't do a very good job for me, even some very uncomfortably tight N95 masks don't get this part right. For reference, I'd guess I have a medium size face/head for a man.
I have recently tried some 3M 9205+ masks that seal amazingly well over my nose while still being comfortable in that area. There are other drawbacks though; mainly price (about 4x the price of these Funights) but also they aren't nearly as comfortable to me as these KN95 style masks with earloops instead of full head straps. I use the 3M N95 masks if I feel the situation is more critical; i.e. I'm in a high risk area (crowded with lots of random people) or if I'm getting on an airplane.
I bought these Funight masks to use in more ""everyday"" situations that I don't expect to be particularly high risk, but I'd like to be wearing something more effective than a cloth mask or a single or double layer accordion style mask.
The only quality control issue I've seen thus far is, as lots of other reviews have mentioned, the ear loop lengths vary noticeably from one mask to another. Thus far all of the lengths have been fine for me; none have been too tight; some have been a little loose but putting one twist in the ear loop has been enough to get it just right. The straps seem to have a lot of stretch, so the batch I have would probably be fine for someone with a larger head than me, but might be too loose for someone with a really small face/head.",positive

Spray spray spray, I let it sit and when I came back to scrub and spray again, lo and behold the stain had disappeared. I contemplated what could be in this??? Tears of my enemies? Pictures of puppies? A switch from momma’s house? Were all these things too much for stains to fight against?

I think they're way over priced for what you get. The filter life seems artificially decreased (when viewing the percentage on the refrigerator). We typically use the filter for 2x it's life span - I manually reset the life percentage counter on the fridge after the first 100% to 0% cycle.

Now, for a bunch of colors, they are different. We believe that the connector between the strips might have been defective or pulled apart over time. For almost a millisecond when you tap on the connector it will go back to normal, or they'll just turn off completely.

200,Tools & Home Improvement,Amazon Smart Plug,$24.99,5,"So I’m kind of new to the amazon device family. We just got our echo a few months ago. I’ve been a prime member for over 10 years so I’m familiar with how amazon has changed life as we knew it (for me anyway). I saw the amazon smart plug when I was searching for any brand smart plug that had Alexa control with it. It’s been in my cart saved for later for at least a month! I finally decided to just pre order it so that I could review it and hopefully help other people that are like me and have fallen way behind in the tech field. For reference I’m an almost 34 year old mom of 2. This means that my 8 year old stole my iPad, iMac, and I haven’t had a computer of my own in about 4 years! So I do everything from my iPhone. I’ve had some weird issues with our echo and my Alexa app that it will just randomly pause a song so I’m not sure what that is about.
ANYWAY! I received my new amazon smart plug the day it was released (so glad it’s not like a new iPhone or PlayStation where people camp out ahead of time or do people still do this??). It was easier than I expected but harder than was described in the listing because my Alexa didn’t just recognize it.
Setup:
Since my Alexa didn’t recognize it on its own, I had to unplug the smart plug and quickly scan the code on the back of the plug, then plug it back in fast so that when it scanned for it it would see it plugged in. After that it was very simple. I was able to plug in my baby monitor and then tell Alexa to “turn off plug one” and it turned off! It is so cool!
Future:
I think homes will end up being built with these right into the electrical system. Maybe they already are.
Comparing:
With so many different brands offering smart plugs with Alexa integration I can’t see myself buying any more than 1 for $25. Too many are 2 for $20. While it’s nice to have the amazon support backing this up, I just can’t afford to fill my home with them at such a high cost comparative to other brands that do the same exact thing.
Overall:
If you can afford to fill your plugs with these then do! This smart plug is easy and awesome! But if you’re on a tight budget like I am, I would try a different brand first and see if those will work just as well.
Every time I purchase something online, I always check the reviews. I count on others to help me choose the best option. My reviews are always my honest opinion and I try to include photos if possible.

201,Tools & Home Improvement,Amazon Smart Plug,$24.99,4,"I have this plugged up to a lamp, and I cannot tell you the amount of times I've gone to flip off the light switch only to stop in my tracks. I'll be standing right next to the switch and have to call out to Alexa to turn my light off for me. It's funny to me, personally, and I can't help but laugh. It's the fact that I have to walk past the light switch every time and take an extra few seconds to ask Alexa to do it that gets me.

Of course, you can have it plugged up to something other than a light, this is just from my personal experience. The downside to having it connected to a lamp (or at least a lamp that's connected to the plug with a light switch) is that if you accidentally turn it of... Which I've done PLENTY of times... Is that there's a delay to when you can have Alexa turn on the light. So, when I accidentally turn off my switch (a habit that I'm having to learn to break) I have to give it about 10-15 seconds to reestablish the connection back to my Alexa. This is mostly because I have it connected to the outlet with the switch connection though, so anyone not facing the exact same thing as me probably won't have that issue at all.",positive
202,Tools & Home Improvement,Amazon Smart Plug,$24.99,5,"I have a little bone pile of dead wifi plugs - I believe that everything in my house should be able to be controlled by my voice. My Echo has become so integrated into my life that it seems somehow crude that I should be expected to turn on my own lights like a caveman, when I could simply ask Alexa to ""turn off the cement mixer.""

So, in my quest to have a completely voice activated house, I buy different wifi plugs. It is a bit like dating, there is an initial time where everything is perfect. But eventually I can no longer turn it on and it disconnects and stops listening to me. Sure, I could probably improve my odds with some sort of therapy, but it always seems to end in heartbreak, and the plug is eventually added to a growing pile of ex's.

But Alexa still loves me throughout the process, and the Amazon plug seems to be the only thing that is committed to the long-term relationship. Even after months of self-centered commands to the plug to pay attention to my needs, my plug turns on when I want it to, and turns off when I ask it to. I could not be happier.

203,Tools & Home Improvement,Amazon Smart Plug,$24.99,4,"I have Amazon's Flex and like it very much. I decided to add a couple of smart plugs because I am disabled and sometimes getting up to turn lights on or off can be difficult.

The first plug I got I used for the lights by my bed. Sometimes when I'm tired and ready to sleep the activity involved in getting up to turn off a light wakes me up enough I *can't* sleep, which is really annoying. This has solved that problem. I just tell Alexa, ""Lights off,"" and they're off. I love it. But. Setup was not intuitive at all. It took me about a half hour to wade thru the hassle of persuading Alexa that there actually was such a plug and getting her to name it. Part of the problem was that Alexa doesn't recognize the term Smart Plug, which is what I was ignorantly calling the smart plug. I finally figured out that I should be calling it Plug 1.

Once that was going, I thought I would add an extra plug for a lamp I sometimes use. Plugging it in and turning it on wasn't sufficient for Alexa to find it, even tho I remembered to call it Plug 2. After searching thru the Alexa app on my Fire tablet I finally found a way to get Bluetooth to add it. Then Alexa was willing to rename it for me and it now works. All this took me over a half hour, but I'm almost happy with it.

Almost happy? It's theoretically possible to pair the two up so I can turn both on or off at once, but Bluetooth doesn't seem to know what the devices are so Alexa doesn't know, so it's going to take another half hour, or more, to get that feature turned on.

I recently read an article by a smart-home tech expert who says he's going with another brand (Google?) because Alexa can be too finicky. I don't want the stuff he was having problems with, like a curtain opener, but the hassle with setting up these two plugs makes me feel he's got a point. Still, things are easier for me than they were and I AM largely pleased with the results. It just seems like it should be simpler to get it going. If their e-readers and Fire tablets were this hard to setup, no one would buy them.",positive

Love that I can use the voice control to turn on the lamp as soon as I enter my room and this prevents me from stumbling or accidentally bumping into furniture. Also, just as easily turn off the lights with my voice and this helps me save electricity when I am not in the room.

The one downside I have experienced with this product is that the smart plug becomes unresponsive one some occasions. I disconnected once this week and I had to reconnect it by doing the setup once again. This may have occurred because the wifi disconnected for a bit. Also, it disconnected a second time but the wifi was stable that time which confused me. I wish the set up was more simple.

Due to a snowstorm I was without internet for several days, and had to plug in my old school manual pin timer to use my light in the mean time. This seems like a weird oversight.

209,Tools & Home Improvement,Amazon Smart Plug,$24.99,5,"Edit: I've bought the device a second time and it connected much better with the most recent Echo Dot. I plugged the device into a power strip and use it for my computer charger so it doesn't overcharge my laptop. I don't know if they've made improvements, but connection worked out great so I've upgraded my review from 3 stars to 5 stars.

Thoughts:
1. I wanted to try using this as a plug for a power strip, but it doesn't work because there must be some safety feature.

2. If the Echo/Alexa has trouble finding your plug, don't panic. There is a button on the side of the device that you can press for the light to flash and for the plug to be ""discoverable"".

3. The plugs are named in chronological order (ie. First plug, second plug, etc.) and you can't edit the names though you can group devices on your Alexa app. So keep track of which plug is which.

4. Again, I don't believe that this device should be used for life saving equipment as it is dependent on your wifi connection and Echo/Alexa adds an additional command step to the sequence of using a machine.

I would recommend this product!

Previous Review:
I waited to review this plug because I wanted to try it out with different devices and at different distances from both Echo/-Dot and my modem.

Devices: I tried the plug with a space heater and with a laptop (to avoid overcharging). I plugged it into a power strip with no problem, but do note if you're using a space heater with an automatic shut off, the plug is going to be shut off just like the rest and you have to turn on the strip and then tell Echo to turn on the plug separately. I've decided that the automatic shut off is enough of a safety feature and the Smart Plug is best used for devices that are capable of utilizing a continuous stream of electricity without emergently overloading and need the plug to monitor the usage (e.g. a laptop). ***Please take note of my exception at the bottom of the review!

Now for the big item issue: Connectivity.
I believe the key is that your Wifi connection needs to be optimized to get the most out of this plug. If you have slightly unreliable wifi (e.g. I live out in the country with plenty of winter storms), plug the smart plug closer to your modem and minimize the distance from your Alexa. I don't know if this is a must, but it worked for me. If your internet shorts out in, you don't have to re-setup the plug, but the plug lights might get thrown off for a bit (it will stay red even when it's on and flash blue at random points). Ignore that. If your Echo/-dot is flashing red as well, the plug is going to be down.Just give the Wifi a second to settle down and you should be set to go. The irritating part is that the Echo resyncs with the Wifi much faster than the plug. I tried to reset it up/give it time and it took hours for it to sync up again, but maybe that was because it was further away from the Echo/modem. Either way, just know that once your wifi has been signed in, as long as you haven't changed the password, your sign in is set.

Other reviewers are correct: the set up instructions are easy to overlook. Either have the instructions next to you so you have the set up password or be near an outlet.
1. You go into your Alexa app
2. The top left corner has the three lines
3. Click on add a device
4. Choose plug
5. Brand is Amazon,
6. Click ""Next"" to agree to the conditions of use and terms
7. Scan the barcode on the back of the plug or from the instructions (You have to get the little box with squiggly lines to be lined up in the sights of the screen) and then follow the instructions. It's okay if you have to unplug the smart plug for a second to scan the 2D barcode, just plug it back in quickly.
8. It will tell you to press the button on the side till the lights flash red and blue (keep pressing till that happens) and then make sure to follow the instructions for signing into your Wifi.

***IMPORTANT and MY OPINION: I really wouldn't recommend that you use this plug for life-saving/emergency equipment even if you think that you have the best Wifi in the world. A plug with a timer or any regular plug is reliant on electricity, but, as aforementioned, this plug requires an extra step of being turned on by Echo/-Dot. If your electricity goes out momentarily, you lose the time waiting for the lights to turn back on, but with the plug you have to additionally ask for Echo to turn the plug back on and/or resync with your wifi.",positive

Today they did. She took a Claritin and it helped some, but then after an outing, returning home, she started sneezing about every 4 seconds. She was miserable! So was I.

Threw a new one of these into the HVAC system, turned on the A/C, her symptoms subsided in minutes. I mean literally in about 4 minutes.

If you love someone with allergies, you will know how terrible it is when you can't do anything to help them.

I wish these filters had been available when my son used to suffer from seasonal allergy.

This is not a luxury purchase.

Now, I have not done a side-by-side comparison test, though I do have some less expensive filters sitting there just in case - or maybe I'll throw those in, in the winter months (which is about 7 months per year here). So, other filters might be just as good. I don't know and I don't care - I'm gonna keep buying these because I love my wife and want her healthy and happy, not miserable.",positive
220,Tools & Home Improvement,"WWDOLL KN95 Face Mask 25 Pack, 5-Layers Breathable KN95 Masks",$14.25 - $21.02,4,"THIS PRODUCT CLEARLY STATES in #5 in the Amazon ad: This KN95 mask is NOT an N95 mask and NOT NIOSH approved.

However........

Well, you can search the bag for hours, you will not find the FDA/CDC label, or any for that matter, that certify this mask as being N95. There is one line that talks about N95 but it really is advertised as not being N95 certified. That said, I wore this mask for the bulk of the pandemic and just received both Pfizer shots - I never tested positive for COVID.

So, clearly my experiences will not match all who are reading, but I can only say that during the time I wore this I went to hospitals, grocery stores, restaurants, everywhere you can go - even when things were wide open and then closed, and then opened again. It is VERY COMFORTABLE even when playing ice hockey or other sports.

Is it N95? I am not sure. Here is my test. When you use a fabric or ""sock style"" you can feel your breath. When you use a N95 mask and breathe out, you cannot feel your breath - that is usually one way to tell it is a true N95. It is harder to breathe in one because it is blocking more coming in - and thus going out as well.

That said, this packed DOES NOT carry the CDC approved N95 mask label, it does not carry any label anywhere saying it is N95 certified. But........again, it FEELS like a N95 and given this comes from a country where this is not required, well, I just have to go with knowing I felt safe for 10 months using this as it was the only one I could get in bulk bags.

LONGEVITY: 2-4 days. I know they say 8-10 hours, but honestly, I used these masks 2-4 days at a minimum during the height of the pandemic, washing them when I came home with hot water and letting it dry. Sometimes I would spray Lysol on it and then let it sit overnight. Then used it again.

COMFORT: This is where I feel these shine. Eye loops are long and I have a big head...truly, I do at 25"" around. So my head is like a man's 7 3/4 which is a large head. It fit me fine as well as my wife whose head is about 2"" smaller around. Not sure how it adapted to both our heads, but neither of us complained.

LOOKS: It is a bit pointy if you will, but not quite the scary ""movie pointy"" or Metallica ""One"" pointy. It actually keep the mask from your face and nose a bit which is what you want imo.

Price to Mask: With tax and shipping, let's say you are spending $45 per bag of 25. That is $1.80 per mask. Now if you do as I did, each bag lasted me about 75 days. If you only wear it to go in the store and out, again, the CDC recommends that N95 masks protect for about 8-10 hours. So go by the amount of time you wear it, not what you are doing. I work from home so if you wear it all day, every day, these would be VERY expense at about $45 a month. But, for protection and comfort, I cannot say $45 in a pandemic is all that costly either.

LASTING: Again 2-4 days per mask or wash and wear again. Doctors and nurses did this early on in the pandemic when there were no masks. Honestly, I did not feel any difference on day 4 than day 1.

PACKAGING: Excellent. It looks and feels medical when you get them. The bag reseals and inside you will find 3 separate plastic bags that house 3 sets of masks. It felt very ""sterile"" and I honestly feel that when I get these masks, it is better than what most hospitals are using.

OVERALL IMPRESSION: I tried literally 50 kinds of covers as we adapted to the pandemic and I kept coming back to these ordering 2-3 packs each time when available. I do not see this pandemic ending for 2-3 more years, so I would buy them when they are available.

N95 Certification: This fails the N95 test, it just does. It says it on the mask, but I could say ""100% effective"" on any mask and that is not true. Nowhere does the bag say it is certified N95 by anyone. Nowhere. It just FEELS like a N95, it breathes like a N95 and it looks like a N95. You cannot feel your breath and I cannot feel others when they breath on me. At least in my case, it protected as a ""N95 mask"" for the pandemic up and until I was vaccinated last month. I still wear the black version every day.

Nose Bridge: Very flexible and fits nicely.

While I do wear cloth masks here and there - 100% for protective masks, this is the one I went with and it got lots of ""where did you get those"" from people. While I am not seeking compliments for a darn mask in a pandemic, it is slightly different but protective imo.",positive

I'm used to wearing these all the time as I am immune compromised. They do not leave indentions or marks on your face yet seal really good around the face at the same time.

It's way too late to return it or otherwise resolve it through Amazon, so I'm going to contact Reynolds to see if they'll make it right. My experience with production errors is that they are infrequent and the manufacturer is typically very accommodating.

What frustrates me is that the filter - at least for me - is very high maintenance. I'll pour water into the pitcher, fully expecting it to take a while to filter through. The water then gets to the point where it will not flow down at all. Then I go through a routine of shaking the pitcher and slamming it down on a book to try to start the water flow, which usually works. In worst cases, I wash my hands and take it apart to squeeze the filter to try to make it work - which is also what is recommended on their website.

It does filter water very well - and I live in an area where the tap water tests over 400 with the tds sensor. I expected it to need to be changed more frequently, so I now use my old Brita pitcher and filter to ""pre-filter"" the water to try to make the filter last longer. What frustrates me is that the filter - at least for me - is very high maintenance. I'll pour water into the pitcher, fully expecting it to take a while to filter through. The water then gets to the point where it will not flow down at all. Then I go through a routine of shaking the pitcher and slamming it down on a book to try to start the water flow, which usually works. In worst cases, I wash my hands and take it apart to squeeze the filter to try to make it work - which is also what is recommended on their website. I wish Zero Water would look into their filter design and see if there is a way that they could make it a little less high maintenance. It does a good job of filtering the water.",positive

And, was using bottled water again. Besides spending money on bottles I was reading articles about what is in bottled water. So I decided to use this again and bought the filters. It is definitely saving me money. The meter showed around a 200 level before the water was filtered and 0 after. So far I’ve been using one filter for a few weeks now. So I’m not sure about longevity . There is no flavor as it tastes like water. No chlorine taste . So far so good.",positive

Let’s just say, it’s been many years. I assumed they were all the same or that brita was better. Even with brita, my water was not so great tasting after moving to an area with lower quality water. I tried zero water and am suddenly drinking water again. I’m blown away by the taste difference. It is also wild how it doesn’t slowly lose efficacy. It is hugely effective right up until the moment it’s used up. It instantly goes from clean and tasty to I need to change the filter. They include a device to test particle presence in the water. I tested it and thought it was broken until I tested untreated tap water. 0 particles vs over 300 particles. Just make sure you have your next filter already so that when it needs replacing you can switch it immediately. And it filters water more slowly. Definitely glad I switched.",positive

These filters work! Our water is public but comes from a series of very large community wells and even though it is treated, it still has a lot of dissolved minerals. This filter takes it all out on gives pure great tasting water. For a while. We are a family of four and are all drinking lots more water. I have the big dispenser in the fridge. After about a month of great tasting water, it starts to taste like chapstick of all things. Pop in a new filter and back to great water. Pro tip… refill the top of the dispenser often to keep the water line in the refill chamber above the filter opening that is on the bottom of the refill chamber. If the filter opening is exposed to the air, it seems so absorb any smells from food in the fridge. That is how good the filter is. Water still tastes great until it doesn’t. I just think keeping the water line over the filter makes it last longer.",positive
264,Tools & Home Improvement,"ZeroWater 5-Stage Water Filter Replacement, NSF Certified to Reduce Lead, Other Heavy Metals and PFOA/PFOS, 2 Count (Pack of 1), White",[],4,"The filter is not emptying the upper chamber completely. Filtration will stop when the upper chamber is half full, then only resume filtering if we refill the upper chamber back to full. Used the first one in the 2-pack for about 2 weeks, then switched to the second one, same result. The original filter that came with the 30 cup tabletop model was working great. These must be defective filters.
Update:
Head back from customer care very promptly. They suggested squeezing the middle of the filter 4-5 times while it's filtering, to remove air bubbles. Tried that and the filter is working perfectly. Changing Star rating back to 4. Great filtration!",positive

Out tap water smells like a swimming pool and this filter works like a charm.

We have terrible water quality - hard, lots of iron, terrible flavor, etc , and this makes a world of difference. When compared to a Brita - there was no comparison.

We have very hard water. This is the only filter i've seen that actually tests at 0 ppm after filtration. For my usage it lasts about 1 month before the ppm will slowly creep up, usually after a month it will test at 3 ppm. I use it quite a bit (ice, coffee, drinking water) so 1 month is fine by me.

I've compared it to some other major brands and none of them come close. Usually the others could not get lower that 40-50 ppm.",positive

This seems like another Recurring Charge scam by large companies to get more money, so I was VERY grumpy to learn that this was yet another ""rental"" fee I would have to pay for the life of the machine.
However, I was relieved to find the genuine filter on Amazon for less than advertised on the Samsung website, and could get it delivered to my home the next day. We'd been without ice during a heat wave for three days before we figured out what happened, so speed was a factor in my purchase. The filter packaging came with a code to check on the internet with Samsung to confirm it was a ""genuine"" manufacturer's part (the machine warranty is void if you use a non-genuine filter). Could probably find it a litter cheaper elsewhere, but with Amazon return policy and delivery speed, it was a great solution to a timely problem. Would buy again (if the price remains reasonable).",positive

We have an extended warranty on the refrigerator so a technician was sent out and fixed it but you need to turn multiple times before it locks fully in place.

The filter replacement light came on and I ordered this one. At first I couldn’t get it to fit. I was pushing and turning and it just wouldn’t budge. We cut the main water supply off (easier to get to than behind the fridge) and emptied the line. Tried again, pushed and pushed and would not work. I look inside the fridge down the filter hole and the previous homeowners didn’t take the lid off the filter they put in. The water hasn’t been filtered this whole time we’ve been drinking it. Used needle nose pliers to pull out the cap that was very wedged back in there. So check to make sure your previous homeowners took the cap off the last filter before you try to put a new one in

Works great now, water tastes better, no complaints about the filter. Was very easy to install once we figured out the problem.",positive
